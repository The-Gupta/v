After three cycles of the TADOP regimen (6-thioguanine, cytosine-arabinoside, doxorubicin, vincristine & prednisone), the patient entered complete remission. Unfortunately, after a seven month period of remission she suffered a relapse which was refractory to a new chemotherapy cycle. On 9/14/88 an allogeneic BMT from her HLA identical brother was performed. The conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Prophylaxis for GVHD consisted of cyclosporine and methylprednisolone. The posttransplantation course was satisfactory, reaching > 500 neutrophils x 10(9)/L on day 14 and > 50,000 platelets x 10(9)/L without support on day 23 posttransplant. The patient developed fever of unknown etiology, which was satisfactorily resolved with ceftazidime, vancomycin and metronidazole. She also presented a grade II oral and esophageal mucositis. As a late complication, on day 90 posttransplant, she developed a bilateral pneumonia which was resolved with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim administration.

In a 42-year-old woman with APL all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin), 45 mg/m2/day was given per os for 90 days. APL is associated with a distinct cytogenetic abnormality: translocation of a portion of the long arm chromosome 17 onto the long arm chromosome 15t (15; 17) with a breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the region of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha), playing a crucial role in the leukemogenesis of APL. In man, the drug induces myeloid and mainly promyelocytic leukemic cells to differentiate, without the development of bone marrow hypoplasia. In our patient it caused complete remission and the disappearance of intravascular disseminated coagulation. The only side-effects were a transient macular rash, gastrointestinal symptoms and mild hypertriglyceridemia. Other principal adverse effects reported in the literature are relatively not very serious and consist of dryness of the skin, occasional headaches and intracranial hypertension, nasal congestion, lymphadenopathy, respiratory distress with infiltrates in the lung, bone pain and increased hepatic aminotransferase. A hyperleukocytosis syndrome seems to be more problematic. ATRA appears to be superior to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens. It is safe and highly effective in inducing clinical, morphologic and karyotypic remission with a marked decrease in the expression of the abnormal RAR-message in APL. There is a possible molecular link between the pathogenesis and treatment of this severe and often fatal coagulopathic disease. This therapy of course does not eradicate the leukemic clone, and consolidation chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation is necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Knobel, B', 'Sommer, I', 'Meytes, D']","['Knobel B', 'Sommer I', 'Meytes D']","['Dept. of Medicine B, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon.']",['heb'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Israel,Harefuah,Harefuah,0034351,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Harefuah. 1992 Dec 1;123(11):445-8, 507.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last 10 years it has become evident that human cancers have multiple genetic alterations caused by point mutations, recombinations, amplifications, and/or deletions. The genes affected include both oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes and genes that accelerate cell proliferation and metastasis. Cancers with more malignant properties and poorer prognosis are generally associated with larger numbers of genetic alterations. These multiple genetic alterations are considered to be a direct reflection of the multiple steps involved in carcinogenesis. The multiple genetic alterations are caused by multiple environmental carcinogenic substances or factors, each of which usually exists only at minute concentrations and does not exert any major impact alone except under particular occupational, iatrogenic, and locally geographic conditions. The fact that carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving multiple genetic alterations clearly needs to be taken into consideration in assessing the risks of environmental carcinogenic substances or factors. The increasing incidence of multiple primary cancers is also most easily understood from the viewpoint of multiple steps in carcinogenesis. Possible multiple approaches to cancer prevention should therefore be considered in relation to multistep carcinogenesis and multiple carcinogenic factors.","['Sugimura, T', 'Terada, M', 'Yokota, J', 'Hirohashi, S', 'Wakabayashi, K']","['Sugimura T', 'Terada M', 'Yokota J', 'Hirohashi S', 'Wakabayashi K']","['National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/adverse effects', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Risk']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1992 Nov;98:5-12. doi: 10.1289/ehp.92985.,,['10.1289/ehp.92985 [doi]'],,"['HST1', 'INT2', 'K-ras', 'N-ras', 'c-erbB-2', 'c-myc', 'k-sam', 'p-53']",91,PMC1519606,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased proportions or absolute numbers of blood lymphocytes with LGL morphology and/or NKa+ phenotypes are associated with a diverse spectrum of clinical (haematological and non-haematological) disorders and may be broadly viewed as secondary (acute and chronic reactive) or primary in nature. Both primary and secondary LGL/NKa+ expansions may be persistent in type and the clinical distinction between the two may be difficult. A number of investigators have proposed schemes for the classification of these disorders but, because of their diversity, abnormal LGL/NKa+ expansions often defy rigid compartmentalisation.

In 1976 the French American British (FAB) Cooperative Group included EL within the classification system of acute myelogenous leukemias as AML-M6, and agreed on a quantitative standard to be used in the diagnosis of this disorder. The standards were revised in 1985 to the form in use today. We selected a series of 15 cases from our records which specifically fit the FAB criteria for AML-M6. Extensive direct comparison between our series and the old literature is not practical because of the changes which have occurred in classification and definition of the disease. Overall we found a rough correlation between the clinical and laboratory data shown in the old literature on EL and data from our cases. These cases underscore characteristic laboratory features which correspond to what is now defined as AML-M6: these patients present with pancytopenia, frequent peripheral blood nRBCs and no, or few, peripheral blood blasts. In addition, we note the presence of a hybrid myeloid-erythroid blast in the bone marrow in this disease and suggest that this may be characteristic of this type of AML. Old literature on EL has generally shown it to be a disease of the elderly, yet we found a subset of younger patients whose clinical outcome was significantly better than that of the older patients. Finally, EL has historically been viewed as a disease in which patients progress from a prodrome through erythroleukemia to other acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes. Consistent with this idea, half of our 15 patients had been previously diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome or received chemotherapy. On the other hand only one of the 15 patients converted to another type of AML during his course.","['Atkinson, J', 'Hrisinko, M A', 'Weil, S C']","['Atkinson J', 'Hrisinko MA', 'Weil SC']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/classification/complications/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1992 Dec;6(4):204-14. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(92)90016-j.,,"['0268-960X(92)90016-J [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(92)90016-j [doi]']",,,103,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modern methods for identification of minimal residual disease afford the hope that it may become possible to identify both children who have received sufficient treatment and, conversely, those at subsequent risk of relapse. Selection of patients for alternative therapy, for example marrow transplantation in first remission is difficult and this area needs further study. Treatment for the one third of children who relapse remains unsatisfactory and when successful is only achieved with significant morbidity. Most long-term survivors of childhood leukaemia are well and problem-free but a significant number have problems with learning, concentration, growth and development; the risk of second neoplasms remains unclear.

Recent molecular cloning data have demonstrated the existence of mRNAs encoding several different potential tumor-specific fusion proteins in both acute and chronic leukemias, and analysis of a number of these sequences suggests the presence of a newly defined amino acid motif associated with MHC-binding and T cell recognition.

Reverse transcription coupled with the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used to develop a diagnostic test for APL based on the PML-RARA fusion message. Separate PCR assays were designed to amplify either PML-RARA (15q+ derived) or RARA-PML (17q- derived) chimaeric transcripts. PML-RARA transcripts were detected in every case from a series of 18 APL patients with cytogenetically confirmed t(15;17) translocations, whereas RARA-PML messages were detected in only 67% (12/18) of these patients. This suggests that it is the 15q+ derivative which mediates leukaemogenesis. Furthermore the PCR approach (or Southern analysis) may be used to identify in which of the alternative PML introns the breakpoint occurs; 52% of cases (15/29 patients) utilize a 5' PML intron and 48% the 3' intron (14/29 cases). Neither the choice of PML intron nor the expression of the 17q- derivative could be correlated with the microgranular variant of APL (M3V), overall survival rate, age, sex or presence of coagulopathy. Finally, the fusion message is undetectable in five remission samples. This indicates a possible use for RT-PCR in monitoring remission patients for evidence of relapse.","['Borrow, J', 'Goddard, A D', 'Gibbons, B', 'Katz, F', 'Swirsky, D', 'Fioretos, T', 'Dube, I', 'Winfield, D A', 'Kingston, J', 'Hagemeijer, A']","['Borrow J', 'Goddard AD', 'Gibbons B', 'Katz F', 'Swirsky D', 'Fioretos T', 'Dube I', 'Winfield DA', 'Kingston J', 'Hagemeijer A', 'et al.']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Nov;82(3):529-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06463.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06463.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coincubation of cells with 12.5 x 10(-9) M bryostatin 1 and 10(-5) M ara-C for 4 h resulted in a significant increase in ara-CTP formation (compared to controls) in 6/10 specimens (mean increase 106%; range 38-255%), and no change in the remainder. In contrast, coincubation of cells with 1.25 ng/ml rGM-CSF resulted in a significant increase in only one specimen, and decreases in two. Bryostatin 1 also significantly increased ara-C DNA incorporation in 6/9 evaluable samples, including two which did not display an increase in ara-CTP formation. Coincubation of cells with both bryostatin 1 and rGM-CSF did not lead to a further increase in ara-CTP formation or ara-C DNA incorporation compared to values obtained with either agent alone. Finally, exposure of blasts to bryostatin 1 for 24 h before ara-C led to an increase in ara-CTP formation in 3/8 additional specimens, and a decrease in one sample displaying evidence of bryostatin 1-induced macrophage differentiation. Incubation of cells with both rGM-CSF and bryostatin 1 for this period resulted in ara-CTP levels equivalent to those obtained with bryostatin 1 alone. These studies indicate that while bryostatin 1 exerts a heterogeneous effect on ara-C metabolism in leukaemic myeloblasts, it is capable of potentiating ara-C phosphorylation in a subset of patient samples, including some that do not exhibit an increase in response to rGM-CSF. They also raise the possibility that bryostatin 1-induced potentiation of ara-C metabolism in some leukaemic cells may contribute, at least in part, to the antileukaemic efficacy of this drug combination.","['Grant, S', 'Jarvis, W D', 'Turner, A J', 'Wallace, H J', 'Pettit, G R']","['Grant S', 'Jarvis WD', 'Turner AJ', 'Wallace HJ', 'Pettit GR']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298-0230.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Bryostatins', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Nov;82(3):522-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06462.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06462.x [doi]'],,,,,"['CA-09564-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-44344-02A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Cytochemical analysis showed that YOS-M was significantly positive for peroxidase, whereas YOS-B was entirely negative. YOS-M expressed myeloid-associated antigens (CD14, CD33) as well as CD4, CD25 and CD34. The surface phenotype of YOS-M was identical to that of the leukaemic blasts found in the patient. On the other hand, YOS-B expressed mature B-cell markers, CD19, CD20, CD21 and surface immunoglobulin, but not myeloid-associated antigens. These two cell lines showed an identical rearrangement pattern of the break point cluster region on chromosome 22, but rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was detected only in YOS-B.

Of 27 valid cases, six (22%) were repeatedly shown to lack expression of the RB protein with three different anti-RB antibodies. Five were patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and one, mixed-lineage acute leukaemia. The RB inactivation was noted more frequently in AML (5/18, 28%) than in acute lymphoid leukaemia (0/7, 0%). By karyotyping, none of these six patients exhibited cytogenetic changes involving chromosome 13q14, the RB locus. There is no correlation between inactivation of the RB gene and FAB subtypes or cytogenetic changes. Four patients achieved complete remission with standard chemotherapy for 6, 12, 20 and 26+ months, respectively. Southern and Northern blot analyses further indicated that the RB genes were grossly intact and the level of RB transcripts did not decrease in the majority of these six patients.

The human malignant cells used were as follows: cervical cancer (HeLa), mammary cancer (MCF-7), bladder cancer (EJ), hepatoma (HuH-7, PLC/PRF/5), embryonal carcinoma (PA-1), in vitro transformed fibroblasts (KMST-6, SUSM-1, VA-13), five myeloma cell lines (KMM-1, KMS-5, KMS-11, KMS-12, RPMI 8226), Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), chronic myelocytic leukemia (K562), Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen positive lymphoblastoid cells (KMS-9). The cells were treated with 25 to 100 micrograms/ml suramin for 72h. Proliferation of HuH-7 and two human myeloma cells (KMS-11 and KMS-12) was remarkably inhibited, and that of PA-1, PLC/PRF/5, KMST-6, two other myeloma cell lines (KMM-1 and KMS-5), Raji and HL-60, was moderately inhibited. In order to confirm part of the results obtained from in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments were also undertaken. The growth of HuH-7 cells transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice was significantly suppressed by intravenous injection of suramin. We discussed the possibility that certain types of human cancers, the growth of which seemed to be more or less dependent on polypeptide growth factors, might be sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of suramin.","['Bai, L', 'Naomoto, Y', 'Miyazaki, M', 'Orita, K', 'Namba, M']","['Bai L', 'Naomoto Y', 'Miyazaki M', 'Orita K', 'Namba M']","['Department of Cell Biology, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Acta Med Okayama,Acta medica Okayama,0417611,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Suramin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Med Okayama. 1992 Dec;46(6):457-63. doi: 10.18926/AMO/32642.,,['10.18926/AMO/32642 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Included are data from current or recently completed studies conducted by major pediatric oncology cooperative groups and large individual oncology centers for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent tumors. Sarcomas, neuroblastoma, lymphomas, recurrent solid tumors, brain tumors, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are discussed. Randomized trials to determine the relative efficacy of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide in various childhood malignancies are under way. The long-term consequences of ifosfamide in survivors of childhood cancer, in terms of development of bladder cancer or other malignancies thought to be associated with alkylating agents, are not known, and will only be determined through follow-up studies of adult survivors.

There is increasing evidence, however, that BMT can be followed by severe long term effects including neuroendocrine, ophthalmologic, dental and central nervous system abnormalities, particularly in children. Therefore the indication to BMT depends on the results obtained by conventional therapy. Due to the high cure rates of leukemia with conventional therapy BMT is only warranted following relapse except for certain forms with poor prognosis factors. For patients with chronic myelogeneous leukemia, however, BMT is the only chance of cure. In solid tumors the role of BMT is more difficult, because there is no clear evidence that BMT is superior to conventional therapy with regard to long term survival. In severe aplastic anemia, however, the long term results of BMT are clearly better than those obtained by conventional therapy. Other undisputed indications for BMT are severe combined immuno deficiencies and other congenital diseases for which BMT is currently the only curative therapy. Progress with matched unrelated donor transplantations by better histocompatibility testing and more specific immunosuppressive therapy to reduce graft-versus-host disease, still a major problem of allogeneic BMT, as well as the perspectives of gen therapy in the future will offer a chance of cure to many patients without a matched sibling donor.","['Slavc, I']",['Slavc I'],"['Universitats-Kinderklinik, Graz, Osterreich.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Austria,Padiatr Padol,Padiatrie und Padologie,0022370,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*methods/mortality', 'Child', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Rate']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Padiatr Padol. 1992;27(6):167-75.,"Indikationen, Probleme und Zukunftsperspektiven der Knochenmarktransplantation in der Padiatrie.",,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,

The microfluorometric analysis of the cellular level of doxorubicin in drug-resistant cells showed that cepharanthine markedly enhanced the sensitivity of doxorubicin against resistant cells in the cellular level. Cepharanthine also enhanced the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on the incorporation of thymidine into DNA in resistant cells. The analysis of DNA histogram obtained by flow cytometry showed that doxorubicin exerted its growth-inhibitory effect by blocking the cell cycle at the G2 phase in P388 cells. At higher concentrations, doxorubicin prolonged the S phase and inhibited cell cycle progression to the G2/M phase in cells. The treatment with cepharanthine potentiated these blocking effects induced by doxorubicin in cells. It seems that the modifications of the biological effect of doxorubicin by cepharanthine are due to the change of their ability to induce DNA damage in cells.","['Kisara, S', 'Hayashi, A', 'Maekawa, I', 'Furusawa, S', 'Takayanagi, Y', 'Sasaki, K']","['Kisara S', 'Hayashi A', 'Maekawa I', 'Furusawa S', 'Takayanagi Y', 'Sasaki K']","['Dept.

Etoposide inhibited the active influx of ara-C in a dose dependent manner, and the inhibition was reversible. Etoposide also affected the intracellular accumulation of ara-C, though its inhibitory effect for the intracellular accumulation was weaker than that for the influx of ara-C. It was also shown that etoposide inhibited the active efflux of ara-C. Furthermore, etoposide inhibited the active transport of ara-C bidirectionally but the insensitive route of etoposide existed especially at high concentration of ara-C. The effect of inhibition of the transport of ara-C on the accumulation of ara-C was more significant at lower concentration of ara-C. Judging from the drug concentrations used in this study, an interaction between etoposide and ara-C could occur in the clinical treatment.","['Ooi, K', 'Ohkubo, T', 'Kuwabara, H', 'Higashigawa, M', 'Sakurai, M']","['Ooi K', 'Ohkubo T', 'Kuwabara H', 'Higashigawa M', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Pharmacy, Social Insurance Hazu Hospital, Yokkaichi, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 1992 Nov;112(11):832-6. doi: 10.1248/yakushi1947.112.11_832.,,['10.1248/yakushi1947.112.11_832 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes coding for easily measured products (reporter genes) can be used to study promoter strength and regulation of gene expression after transient expression of promoter-reporter constructs in mammalian cells. To determine the strength of a variety of mammalian and viral promoter-enhancer sequences in primary cultures of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), these sequences were fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and transfected into HMEC using strontium phosphate. The long terminal repeat (LTR) of the endogenous murine leukemia virus AKR-623 was the most potent promoter of transient CAT expression in HMEC. A number of commonly available promoter sequences displayed a wide range of activities in these cells. The glucocorticoid responsive LTR promoter from the murine mammary tumor virus modulated expression of CAT and was sensitive to the concentration of dexamethasone in the growth media. In a similar fashion, the regulatory sequences from the murine metallothionein-1 gene retained responsiveness to zinc concentration in the growth media.","['Huper, G', 'Marks, J R', 'Wiener, J R', 'Iglehart, J D']","['Huper G', 'Marks JR', 'Wiener JR', 'Iglehart JD']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol,In vitro cellular & developmental biology : journal of the Tissue Culture Association,8506951,"['0 (Culture Media)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Culture Media/analysis/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/analysis/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/drug effects/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/*genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Metallothionein/genetics', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Zinc/analysis/pharmacology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol. 1992 Nov-Dec;28A(11-12):730-4. doi: 10.1007/BF02631061.,,['10.1007/BF02631061 [doi]'],,['CAT'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a significant excess of polyvalent farming and electronic engineers among professions of cases, and, in addition of metal workers when considering the professions pursued for more than 5 years. The corresponding exposures were analysed through a detailed questionnaire, and assessed by an industrial hygienist after blinding the case-control status. The odds ratios (OR) were computed after adjustment on matching variables and prior chemo- or radiotherapy treatment, and after stratification for the level and total duration of exposure. There was no excess of professional exposure to ionizing radiation among cases. A significant relationship was observed between acute leukaemia and high or medium exposure to benzene, as well as over 10 years high or medium exposure to exhaust gas. In addition a significant relationship was observed with exposure to pesticides--insecticides and/or weed killers--and to electric and magnetic fields (EMF). The relationship with pesticides was significant when considering high or medium exposure to weed killers and more than 10 years exposure to both subtypes of pesticides. The relationship with pesticides and EMF remained significant when confounding factors were taken into consideration and after adjustment on co-exposure to benzene. The cytological studies showed that acute leukaemias following exposure to benzene (high or medium) and to EMF were only of myelogenous subtypes, whereas those following exposure to pesticides were divided between lymphoblastic and myeloblastic subtypes. Cytogenetic studies failed to show increased frequency of chromosomal abnormalities, as described in acute leukaemias secondary to anti-cancer treatments. Our study adds credence to the hypothesis that pesticides and EMF are leukaemogenic agents, together with benzene.","['Richardson, S', 'Zittoun, R', 'Bastuji-Garin, S', 'Lasserre, V', 'Guihenneuc, C', 'Cadiou, M', 'Viguie, F', 'Laffont-Faust, I']","['Richardson S', 'Zittoun R', 'Bastuji-Garin S', 'Lasserre V', 'Guihenneuc C', 'Cadiou M', 'Viguie F', 'Laffont-Faust I']","['INSERM U 170, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,"['0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Pesticides)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/epidemiology/etiology"", 'Case-Control Studies', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Herbicides/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Pesticides/adverse effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Solvents/adverse effects']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1992 Dec;21(6):1063-73. doi: 10.1093/ije/21.6.1063.,,['10.1093/ije/21.6.1063 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, while exerting chemotactic activity on monocytes and inducing expression of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 by these cells, TGF beta interferes with bacterially induced tumor necrosis factor alpha production, oxygen radical formation and the adhesiveness of granulocytes to endothelial cells. These mechanisms may provide the basis for the effect of TGF beta to prevent the microvascular changes associated with brain edema formation in bacterial meningitis. Given the potential of lymphocytes as well as macrophages to produce TGF beta 1, this cytokine may exert negative feedback signals on the immune response, provided the cytokine is processed from its latent form to the bioactive homodimer. Potent effects of TGF beta have been observed in experimental animals including the inhibition of the generation of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells and antiviral antibodies as well as the diminution of cellular infiltrates with decreased major histocompatibility complex class-II expression and CD8+ T cells in the tissue of virally infected animals. TGF beta may also be of importance in tumor immunology. By the production of bioactive TGF beta as detected in glioblastoma and acute T-cell leukemia, tumor cells may induce an immunodeficiency state and escape immune surveillance. In inflammation, monitoring of TGF beta in the tissue will bring light on the immune regulation in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.","['Fontana, A', 'Constam, D B', 'Frei, K', 'Malipiero, U', 'Pfister, H W']","['Fontana A', 'Constam DB', 'Frei K', 'Malipiero U', 'Pfister HW']","['Section of Clinical Immunology, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytoma/immunology', 'Autoimmunity/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Brain Neoplasms/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Meningitis, Pneumococcal/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1992;99(1):1-7. doi: 10.1159/000236328.,,['10.1159/000236328 [doi]'],,,58,,,,,,,,,,,,

NSU-1 cells were transduced with recombinant retroviruses that express either the murine or human PNP coding sequences under transcriptional regulation of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) long terminal repeat (LTR), resulting in expression of substantial levels of PNP activity. Untransduced or control virus-transduced NSU-1 cells were extremely sensitive to deoxyguanosine, a PNP substrate that is toxic for lymphoid cells. However, PNP-virus transduction of NSU-1 cells metabolically corrected the sensitivity of these cells to deoxyguanosine, resulting in near wild-type levels of growth inhibition. These results demonstrate that retroviral-mediated PNP gene transfer and expression corrects the metabolic defect observed in PNP-deficient murine lymphoid cells, suggesting that PNP gene transfer and expression in human lymphoid cells might similarly correct substrate-mediated toxicity and provide an effective genetic therapy.","['Foresman, M D', 'Nelson, D M', 'McIvor, R S']","['Foresman MD', 'Nelson DM', 'McIvor RS']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*deficiency', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1992 Dec;3(6):625-31. doi: 10.1089/hum.1992.3.6-625.,,['10.1089/hum.1992.3.6-625 [doi]'],,,,,['AI27416/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

One of these patients had graft failure and one died from graft-versus-host-disease at 7 months. Of the remaining 13 PCR-positive patients, only one (8%) relapsed after 23 months; the other 12 were alive and still in remission after a median follow-up of 16+ months (ranging 5+ to 29+ months). Five patients were PCR negative; all are alive in complete clinical and cytogenetic remission at 10+, 11+, 19+, 25+ and 25+ months post transplant. In this study, detection of subclinical Ph1-positive cells by PCR was not associated with imminent clinical or cytogenetic relapse. Since late recurrence may potentially occur, long-term follow-up is required to definitely determine the prognostic value of the PCR assay.","['Lee, M', 'Khouri, I', 'Champlin, R', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Talpaz, M', 'Trujillo, J', 'Freireich, E', 'Deisseroth, A', 'Stass, S']","['Lee M', 'Khouri I', 'Champlin R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M', 'Trujillo J', 'Freireich E', 'Deisseroth A', 'Stass S']","['Hemopathology Program, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Dec;82(4):708-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06948.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06948.x [doi]'],,,,,['P01 CA 49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

However, the level of sensitivity achieved in different laboratories remains largely unknown. Moreover, the results are usually expressed as positive or negative, making a precise follow-up of the patients difficult. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we devised a quantitative method to measure the amount of Bcr-Abl mRNA in clinical samples. This methodology involves a single reverse transcription step, followed by separate amplifications of Bcr-Abl and total Abl mRNA. These two amplifications are performed in the presence of different dilutions of a same internal standard. This standard consists of Bcr-Abl sequences with an eight bases deletion in exon 2 of Abl. One of the primers used in each separate reaction is labelled with fluorescein. Following amplification, PCR products derived from cellular RNA and those from the internal standard are separated and their relative fluorescence is determined using a laser fluorescent DNA sequencer (ALF, Pharmacia). The number of Bcr-Abl and total Abl mRNA molecules initially present in each sample is then calculated. The accuracy and reproducibility of this method was assessed by studying serial dilutions of K562 RNA into normal RNA. Blood samples from 10 patients in cytogenetic remission under interferon therapy were studied. Only one sample was found negative while the others contained between 0.05 and 17 hybrid Bcr-Abl mRNA molecules per 1000 molecules of Abl mRNA. These results suggest that a variable number of malignant cells are present in the majority of CML patients in cytogenetic remission following interferon therapy.","['Malinge, M C', 'Mahon, F X', 'Delfau, M H', 'Daheron, L', 'Kitzis, A', 'Guilhot, F', 'Tanzer, J', 'Grandchamp, B']","['Malinge MC', 'Mahon FX', 'Delfau MH', 'Daheron L', 'Kitzis A', 'Guilhot F', 'Tanzer J', 'Grandchamp B']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire, INSERM CJF 8904, Faculte Xavier Bichat, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reproducibility of Results']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Dec;82(4):701-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06947.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06947.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ages ranged from 4 to 83 years, median 49 years; 30 were males and 27 were females. The median follow-up time was 7 months, range 1-24 months. Early exits occurred in 12 cases, their median age being 71 years. Forty-five patients were treated with combined aggressive chemotherapy (CT) (n = 26) or low-dose cytarabine (LD-AraC) (n = 19). The following results were obtained with combined CT or AraC, respectively. Complete remission (CR) rates were 73% and 84%, 12-month survival (SV) were 37% and 26%, 24-month SV were 12% and 11%, median SV 10 and 4 months, and relapse rates (RR) were 68% and 94%. These differences were not statistically significant. Irrespective of the treatment modality, the results were better for children (n = 10) than for adults (n = 35): RR rates were 90% and 74%, median SV: 7 and 5 months, 12-month SV: 40% and 22%, 24-month SV; 30% and 9%, and RR: 78% and 81%, respectively; these differences also were not statistically significant. In addition, a literature review of 42 patients from 18 previous reports is presented, including seven cases treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The best results were obtained with BMT: 12 and 24 month SV was 86% and the RR was 0%. On the above-mentioned basis, we feel that children and young adults with M7-AML should be offered BMT. In patients over 60 years old or not eligible for aggressive chemotherapy or BMT, an interesting possibility would be the use of LD-AraC which allows a high CR rate, followed by a classical consolidation regimen in order to prevent early relapses.","['Ruiz-Arguelles, G J', 'Lobato-Mendizabal, E', 'San-Miguel, J F', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Caballero, M D', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, A', 'Orfao, A', 'Gomez-Almaguer, D', 'Vidriales, B', 'Ruiz-Reyes, G']","['Ruiz-Arguelles GJ', 'Lobato-Mendizabal E', 'San-Miguel JF', 'Gonzalez M', 'Caballero MD', 'Ruiz-Arguelles A', 'Orfao A', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Vidriales B', 'Ruiz-Reyes G', 'et al.']","['Laboratorios Clinicos de Puebla, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/surgery']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Dec;82(4):671-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06942.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06942.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-five previously non-transfused patients with acute leukaemia (11 men, 7 women) or autologous bone marrow transplantation for Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2 men, 5 women) received at least 80 donor units of filtered red cells (filtration within 24 h after donation, leucocyte content 8.5 +/- 3.9 x 10(6)/U) and/or of platelet concentrate (produced by the buffy coat method, leucocyte content: 7.8 +/- 4.2 x 10(6)/U). A 1-hour recovery of 20% in three consecutive transfusions, in the absence of clinical factors known to impair increment, was defined as platelet refractoriness. HLA class I antibody screening with a panel of 60 cells was performed before the first transfusion and after 80 U of blood components. Of 25 patients who entered this study, 6 patients developed platelet refractoriness after a mean of 38 units of blood components (range 26-45 U); all 6 were female with a history of multiple pregnancies. In 19 patients regarded as non-refractory, no HLA antibodies were demonstrated (13 men, 6 women).

An epidemiological study of trends in cancer mortality from 1950-1984 among the general population of Kanawha County in southern West Virginia was mounted. Cabell County, West Virginia was chosen to be a comparison county for Kanawha in addition to West Virginia and the total United States. The cancer mortality rates for white males and females were calculated using NCHS mortality data and Census Bureau population data available on the Mortality and Population Data System (MPDS) at the University of Pittsburgh. Mortality rates for cancer in Kanawha and Cabell Counties were evaluated over the time period 1950-1984 with an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. In this analysis, poisson regression models were fit using the statistical program GLIM (Generalized Linear Models) to determine the separate effects of age, period of death, and birth cohort on the specific cancers of interest (lung, liver, bladder, CNS, leukemia, lympho-reticulosarcoma, all cancers). There were no significant county differences for cancer death rates between Kanawha and Cabell Counties except for leukemia among white males [O.R. = 1.27, 95% (C.I. = 1.03-1.6)], and for lympho-reticulosarcoma [O.R. = 1.66(1.24-2.07)], suggesting a possible occupational exposure.

Several age classes and a number of cancer sites have been included. Systematic analysis has so far been limited to cancer mortality. This suggests that childhood leukemia is unusually frequent near some types of installations and the excess is greater for years 0-9 than for later ages. In the earlier decade, 1959-1969, there was questionable consistency of incidence reporting. This report uses the incidence and mortality data only for the period 1971-1980; leukemia and non-leukemia cancer data for those 0-9 years are analyzed, and consistency of incidence reporting is evaluated by comparing incidence and mortality. For comparison with reported data for grouped local authority areas (LAAs) near to 21 different installations, two sources of expected incidence are used. The first is based on regional data, and the second is based on a group of LAAs similar in location, urban/rural character and population size. Effectiveness of treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, the principal type among 0-9-year-old children) has improved in recent decades and this has decreased the case fatality rate, and increased the relevance of incidence data. No significant differences in the mortality/incidence ratio were found when comparing areas near installations with their matched reference areas. Although some standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) are low in comparison areas, these are a reflection of the small numbers in the denominator. Low and high SIRs are observed in both installation and comparison areas. Excluding the populations near Sellafield and Dounreay, the installations of which include nuclear reprocessing and which are reported elsewhere, children living near one of a group of six installations have significantly increased leukemia incidence. One hundred sixty-five cases were observed for the combined population group, whereas 133.6 were expected on the basis of regional data and 141.9 on the basis of comparison areas. The operations of these installations include nuclear research, nuclear fuel production, nuclear weapons manufacture, and radio-isotopic reagent manufacture and marketing. No evidence of any increase of leukemia incidence is found for populations surrounding nuclear power installations, nor in coastal communities possibly affected by Sellafield discharges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Goldsmith, J R']",['Goldsmith JR'],"['Epidemiology and Health Services Evaluation Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 1992 Dec 15;127(1-2):13-35; discussion 43-55. doi: 10.1016/0048-9697(92)90465-5.,,"['0048-9697(92)90465-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0048-9697(92)90465-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of cases in which these diagnoses are made in the same anatomic site (composite lymphomas) or in separate sites (simultaneous or sequential HD and NHL) indicates that this phenomenon occurs more frequently than would be expected by chance alone. The most common form of composite lymphoma is coexistent nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease (NLPHD) and large cell lymphoma (LCL) of B cell phenotype. This finding is consistent with a B cell origin for the abnormal cells in NLPHD, suggesting that LCL represents a form of histologic progression, with the existence of a clonal relationship between the two components. The association of other forms of HD (nodular sclerosis or mixed-cellularity) and NHL is less common, but still significant. As with NLPHD and LCL, one may observe composite lymphomas, or the diagnosis of HD may precede or follow the diagnosis of NHL. The vast majority of NHLs associated with HD are of B cell origin, most commonly follicular lymphomas. An association between HD and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is also observed. In selected cases, Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells are seen in a background of otherwise typical CLL, and some of these patients have progressed to disseminated HD. These findings suggest that, at least in some cases, HD may be clonally related to an underlying B cell malignancy, and that the RS cell may be an altered B lymphocyte.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jaffe, E S', 'Zarate-Osorno, A', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Jaffe ES', 'Zarate-Osorno A', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Hematopathology Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Diagn Pathol,Seminars in diagnostic pathology,8502262,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/classification/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*pathology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Diagn Pathol. 1992 Nov;9(4):297-303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the expression of the 92 kDa proteinase, the gelatinase from human neutrophils was purified and characterized and specific immunologic probes developed for its study in other cell types. Studies of leukemic cell lines (U937s and HL60s) which can be differentiated to a monocyte/macrophage phenotype revealed that after differentiation with phorbol myristic acetate the 92 kDa proteinase was the major proteinase produced. Additional studies of human alveolar macrophages and monocytes differentiated in vitro suggest that these cells secrete a proteinase immunologically and biochemically similar to human neutrophil gelatinase. Although the major gelatinase secreted by the fibroblasts is the 72 kDa proteinase, they also produce the 92 kDa proteinase in a regulated manner.

As in other cases of PV, erythroid colonies were formed in culture of bone marrow from this patient without addition of erythropoietin.

This paper shows that Me2SO, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25(OH)2D3), but not 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (PMA) are potent inducers of MRP-8/14 protein complex in human leukemic cells. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is shown to enhance the inductive effect of RA and 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. We have examined the possibility that MRP expression is regulated through the protein kinase pathway. Both cytosolic and membrane-bound protein kinase C (PKC) activities increased during differentiation by RA and 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. PMA-treatment led to a decrease of cytosolic PKC activity and an increase of membrane-bound PKC activity in the presence of these differentiation inducers, while PMA alone resulted in low cytosolic and high membrane-bound PKC activities. PKC inhibitor H7 inhibited MRP synthesis in HL-60 cells treated with RA and 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. These results suggest that cytosolic PKC activity may be involved in a stimulatory pathway of MRP synthesis and that protein phosphorylation reactions may play important roles in MRP expression during myelocytic differentiation.","['Koike, T', 'Harada, N', 'Yoshida, T', 'Morikawa, M']","['Koike T', 'Harada N', 'Yoshida T', 'Morikawa M']","['Tokyo Institute for Immunopharmacology, Inc.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Calgranulin B)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Calgranulin A', 'Calgranulin B', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytosol/*enzymology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 1992 Nov;112(5):624-30. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123950.,,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123950 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When naphthol ASBI phosphate is used as substrate, AcP activity can also be stained in situ. In the presence of tartrate, activity remains strong in the hairy cells (HC) of hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Thus, the TRAcP stain has remained a reliable marker for HC. To investigate the function of TRAcP in HC, we purified two isoforms of TRAcP from HCL spleen tissue and found them to have similar substrate specificities and inhibitor sensitivities. In this report, we describe in detail the methods for TRAcP purification and compare some of the structural properties of the two isoforms to reinforce the concept that human TRAcP is a heterogeneous group of related enzymes. Band 5 represented only 15-20% of the total TRAcP extracted from HCL spleen. The remaining 80% of TRAcP hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl phosphate but not naphthol ASBI phosphate and was not detectable in acidic, nondenaturing PAGE gels.

The study population was a commercial Holstein dairy herd of approximately 400 milking cows. Cattle were tested for antibodies to BLV at least annually for three years and when culled. Four groups of culled cows were compared: seronegative cows (n = 79), seropositive cows without lymphocytosis (n = 176), seropositive cows with lymphocytosis (> or = 9,000 lymphocytes/microliter) (n = 74), and seropositive cows with lymphosarcoma (n = 29). Seropositive groups of cows were bred more times and had longer calving intervals than seronegative cows. The seropositive groups had greater 305-day ME (mature equivalent) FCM (3.5% fat-corrected milk) per lactation and were older when culled than seronegative cows. However, the percent fat per lactation was greater in seronegative cows. In the last complete lactation, differences in 305-day ME FCM, days open and cull age between groups were reduced and none were significant (p > 0.05). In the cull lactation, only cows with lymphocytosis had reduced milk production relative to seronegative cows, although this difference was not significant. After adjustment for initial production and reproductive values, only seropositive nonlymphocytotic cows were culled at a significantly older age than seronegative cattle. Lymphocytotic cows were culled four months younger on average than nonlymphocytotic seropositive cows. Hence, BLV infected cows had greater milk production on average than uninfected cows. Adverse effects of BLV infection were primarily limited to lymphocytotic cows which were culled earlier and had reduced milk production in the cull lactation.","['Pollari, F L', 'Wangsuphachart, V L', 'DiGiacomo, R F', 'Evermann, J F']","['Pollari FL', 'Wangsuphachart VL', 'DiGiacomo RF', 'Evermann JF']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Canada,Can J Vet Res,Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,8607793,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Bovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Disease/complications/*physiopathology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Count/veterinary', 'Female', '*Lactation', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Longevity', 'Lymphocytosis/complications/physiopathology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/physiopathology/*veterinary', 'Milk/chemistry/cytology', '*Reproduction']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Can J Vet Res. 1992 Oct;56(4):289-95.,,,,,,PMC1263558,['CA09168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

One example, that is the subject of this study, is the presence of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor on the surface of the human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line. The presence of such a receptor, that at first seems to be a simple genetic misprogramming, has an unusual biological function: It serves as a bridge to link the B cell growth factor IL-4 in order to transduce a number of differentiation signals in this M2 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) population. Signal transduction is followed by stimulation of RNA synthesis and subsequent induction of differentiation. Daily administration of low IL-4 dose yields proliferative senescent cells that exhibit 66% of growth inhibition in a 5-day tritiated thymidine incorporation assay. These cells clearly exit from the standard M2 morphology and show more mature characteristics as assessed by the Giemsa-Wright staining technique, followed by a 2-fold increase of the monocyte-granulocyte-specific Mac-1 surface antigen. Cellular function is also affected positively since phagocytosis of latex beads increases considerably after IL-4 treatment. Finally, as reported for normal human and murine monocytes and macrophages, the receptor-ligand interaction augments the levels of the class I and class II antigenic determinants by approximately 60%. Our results suggest that ectopic expression of markers may be a ""distinct"" event required during a short period in the differentiation of certain hemopoietic cells leading to mature and normal phenotypes.","['Vassiliadis, S', 'Kyrpides, N', 'Papamatheakis, J']","['Vassiliadis S', 'Kyrpides N', 'Papamatheakis J']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Heraklion, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/drug effects/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Jun;7(3):235-42. doi: 10.3109/10428199209053628.,,['10.3109/10428199209053628 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 60% of all treated patients all expected to achieve long-term EFS. Patients achieving CR within 3 courses have a very high chance of being cured of their disease and do not require, in our opinion, intensification with other regimens. On the other hand the identification of a group of patients with poorer outcome (i.e. those failing to achieve an early CR) enabled testing of the potential efficacy of superintensive salvage regimens. Together with other 6 Italian hematologic institutions, we have recently participated in a prospective comparative randomized trial in which F-MACHOP was compared to MACOP-B in adults with advanced stages of diffuse large cell or small non-cleaved cell lymphoma. The preliminary results of this trial appear to confirm that F-MACHOP is an effective and tolerable regimen in such patients and there is a suggestion that its efficacy is superior to that of MACOP-B.

In childhood ALL, this translocation is associated with female sex, age less than 1 year, hyperleukocytosis, CD10-/CD19+ B-precursor cell immunophenotype, and myeloid-associated antigen (CD15) expression. There also appears to be an age-related difference in treatment outcome. Adults had the worst prognosis, and children aged 1 to 9 years appeared to have a better outcome than infants or adolescents. Reported cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or secondary leukemia with the t(4;11) have not been well characterized.

The steady-state production of blood cells depends to a large extent on the interaction between hemopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HPC) and the different components of the microenvironment present in the medullary cavity. During the last three decades, in vivo and in vitro studies have allowed significant advances in understanding of the biology of such a hemopoietic microenvironment. Although not evident in histological sections, it is well known that the hemopoietic microenvironment is a highly organized structure that regulates the location and physiology of HPC. The hemopoietic microenvironment is composed of stromal cells (fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, adipocytes), accessory cells (T lymphocytes, monocytes), and their products (extracellular matrix and cytokines). Microenvironmental cells can regulate hemopoiesis by interacting directly (cell-to-cell contact) with HPC and/or by secreting regulatory molecules that influence, in a positive or negative manner, HPC growth. Recent in vitro studies suggest that functional abnormalities of the hemopoietic microenvironment may be implicated in the manifestation of certain hematological disorders such as aplastic anemia, and acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Thus, the characterization of the structure and function of the human hemopoietic microenvironment may have relevance in understanding and treating different hematological disorders.","['Mayani, H', 'Guilbert, L J', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A']","['Mayani H', 'Guilbert LJ', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Mammals']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1992 Nov;49(5):225-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb00053.x.,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb00053.x [doi]'],,,93,,,,,,,,,,,,

However its impact on long term survival has been less certain. Optimal haematological and cytogenetic results have to date been seen when IFN is used in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within one year of diagnosis. We have performed a prospective single arm study on the effect on survival of the addition of low dose IFN (9 mU/week) to conventional oral chemotherapy in patients who were at a median of 19 months from the initial diagnosis at the time of study entry. Comparison of this cohort with a control group of CML patients treated with oral chemotherapy only at the same participating institutions gave an estimated 72% reduction in the risk of death as a result of IFN therapy. Median survival for the IFN group has not been reached at 43 months compared with a median survival of 33 months for the chemotherapy alone group.

The evolution of early stages, 0-I, to late stages, III-IV, occurred frequently without an orderly progression through the intermediate stages. The tumour load as judged by lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly was similar in stages II, III and IV. It would seem that stages 0-II represent a continuous spectrum of increasing tumour load, whereas stages III and IV with tumour load of equal magnitude and suppression of haemopoiesis are likely results of a change in biological behaviour of malignant lymphocytes. Stage II(S) characterised by splenomegaly and absence of lymphadenopathy seems a distinct entity with a unique clinical course. Further evolution of CLL in these patients was characterised by progressive splenomegaly, and as this became marked the clinical course was dominated by 'hypersplenism'. Splenectomy at this late stage led to rapid relief of symptoms, progressive increase of Hb and platelets to normal levels and to a quiescent phase of CLL for a considerable period. The tumour load in stage II(S) was of the same order of magnitude as in stages II, III and IV, yet the survival was similar to that in stage 0. Survival correlated with clinical stage and age at the time of diagnosis, but showed no relation to sex. The significance of these findings is further discussed.","['Singh, A K']",['Singh AK'],"[""Division of Haematology, United Medical School, Guy's Hospital, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 May;7(1-2):87-97. doi: 10.3109/10428199209053606.,,['10.3109/10428199209053606 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The place of ABMT is more difficult to assess and requires further study both compared to chemotherapy and allogeneic BMT. Furthermore, the question of purging needs further study in a controlled fashion. For older patients the choice is more difficult. Transplant related mortality increases with age which makes ABMT an attractive alternative to allogenic BMT. However, recent advances in prophylaxis and treatment of transplant related complications such as cytomegalovirus interstitial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease of the liver might increase long-term survival after allogeneic BMT in older patients. The role of matched unrelated donors in the treatment of ANLL is unresolved but this procedure should probably be reserved for relatively young patients in second complete remission or later.","['Ljungman, P', 'Gahrton, G']","['Ljungman P', 'Gahrton G']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 May;7(1-2):7-14. doi: 10.3109/10428199209053597.,,['10.3109/10428199209053597 [doi]'],,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basis for this study was to delay the development of blast crisis by pulsing dose of drugs known to be effective against emerging ""blast"" cells. The experimental arm which consisted of cytarabine and lomustine did not produce overall results superior to conventional treatment with busulfan. This was related to the non-hematologic effects of the combination which produced significant gastrointestinal toxicity leading to relatively early discontinuation of the combination. Nevertheless, the trial design allowed relatively prompt discontinuation of experimental arm and cross-over to conventional treatment with either hydrea or busulfan. No evidence existed that the use of new drug combinations in CML prejudiced the patient's chance to response to conventional chemotherapy. Thus, a role model for future trials in this disease was developed. With the development of the interferons and other experimental forms of therapy this conceptual development may be of significance.","['Silver, R T', 'Karanas, A', 'Dear, K B', 'Weil, M', 'Brunner, K', 'Haurani, F', 'Holland, J F']","['Silver RT', 'Karanas A', 'Dear KB', 'Weil M', 'Brunner K', 'Haurani F', 'Holland JF']","['New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Section of Clinical Oncology, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Blast Crisis/*prevention & control', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 May;7(1-2):63-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199209053603.,,['10.3109/10428199209053603 [doi]'],,,,,"['CA-03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

In this report we describe 12 patients with HTLV-I induced extranodal T-cell lymphoma collected from the literature and our institute experience. There were 5 males and 7 female patients of middle age positive for HTLV-I antibody. The sites of primary tumor were gastrointestinal, Waldeyer's ring, skin, facial sinuses, and the pleura. All of these were histologically diffuse lymphomas and most of them were found to be a helper/inducer T-cell phenotype, showing integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA. Late leukemic changes and skin infiltration often occurred, but hypercalcemia was rare. Survival time varied from 4 to 35 months, and late organ infiltrations were common. These HTLV-I induced extranodal lymphomas were compared with HTLV-I unrelated extranodal lymphomas or HTLV-I induced nodal lymphomas (lymphoma type ATL). Between 1981 and 1990, we had 110 ATL patients and of these, 5 (4.6%) were HTLV-I induced primary extranodal lymphomas. The frequency of HTLV-I induced extranodal lymphoma might be much higher than expected because until now attention has not been paid to this entity. From the present review, it is suggested that HTLV-I could cause primary extranodal lymphoma which may have some different characteristics from other types of lymphoma. Therefore, patients with T-cell extranodal lymphomas should be investigated further for the presence of HTLV-I antibody and the tumor cells should be examined for the integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA using Southern blot analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Shimamoto, Y', 'Yamaguchi, M']","['Shimamoto Y', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/microbiology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 May;7(1-2):37-45. doi: 10.3109/10428199209053600.,,['10.3109/10428199209053600 [doi]'],,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three patients with lymphoma and five with acute leukemia had high serum ferritin levels despite achieving apparent complete hematological remission which was of short duration. The results were compared with groups of lymphoma patients at presentation and during remission and with healthy normal controls. In all the lymphoma patients and in 3 of the 5 leukemia patients the percent of ferritin glycosylation was normal at CR. It was low at the time of diagnosis in all patients. Thus, the percent glycosylation proved a more reliable marker for clinical remission than total serum ferritin. During follow up after BMT in uncomplicated cases, the percent of glycosylated ferritin returned to normal levels earlier than the total serum ferritin. These findings indicate that the evaluation of the amount of glycosylated ferritin may provide useful information in hematological patients in whom there is a discrepancy between high serum ferritin levels and the clinical condition.","['Konijn, A M', 'Kaplan, R', 'Or, R', 'Matzner, Y']","['Konijn AM', 'Kaplan R', 'Or R', 'Matzner Y']","['Department of Nutrition, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (glycosylated ferritin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/surgery', 'Ferritins/*analogs & derivatives/*blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glycosylation', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/surgery', 'Lymphoma/*blood/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/surgery', 'Reference Values']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 May;7(1-2):151-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199209053616.,,['10.3109/10428199209053616 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), the red blood cells of the patient became agglutinable with anti-A blood group reagents. To elucidate whether the blood group A antigen expression was of plasma or of bone marrow origin, total non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were prepared from red blood cells and plasma collected 17 months after BMT, and from plasma collected 13, 15 and 19 weeks after BMT. The glycolipid fractions were analysed by thin-layer chromatography and immunostained with monoclonal A-antibodies, and permethylated and permethylated-reduced derivatives of selected plasma samples were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results strongly indicate the presence of host bone marrow-produced blood group A red blood cells. Furthermore, the presence of a blood group H active pentaglycosylceramide type 1 (H-5-1) (Table I), characteristic for an OLe(a-b-) secretor, was seen in plasma 3-4 weeks before clinical chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). After treatment of chronic GVHD, this expression disappeared. The blood group ALeb (A-7-1) antigen produced by the recipient seems to be present and to increase with time in all plasma samples.

The present study monitored the risk for cancer and adverse reproductive outcome among Danish nurses handling ADs. No increased risks were found for miscarriages, malformations, low birth weight, or preterm birth among the offspring of nurses handling ADs during pregnancy. The sex ratio was normal. The relative risk (RR) for leukaemia was significantly increased (10.65) but based on only two cases, one of acute myeloblastic and one of chronic myeloid leukaemia. From the available exposure data occupational exposures to ADs were apparently higher in the studies that have reported increased risks for miscarriages and malformations than in the present one. Regarding reproductive outcome the study gives some confidence that the safety measures which were implemented in the oncology departments around 1980 can protect the health personnel against adverse effects of ADs on reproduction. As the study is as yet the only negative one in a well protected setting, it should be followed up by other studies of well protected health personnel handling ADs.

Relation to clinical manifestations and ribonucleoprotein autoantibodies.,1483-91,"OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between antibodies that recognize human retroviral proteins and the presence of clinical features and ribonucleoprotein antibodies in patients with autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTDs). METHODS: Antibodies against native human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I, recombinant HIV-1 Nef protein, and ribonucleoprotein antigens were determined by immunoblot of sera from 65 prospectively studied patients with definite or suspected CTDs of autoimmune type. RESULTS: Antibodies to retroviral proteins (ARP), most frequently to HIV Gag proteins p55 and p24, were found in 64% of 22 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in 63% of 8 patients with discoid LE (DLE), in 75% of 8 patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and in 26% of 19 individuals with chronic biologically false-positive (CBFP) seroreactions, but not in 8 patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. No clear correlation of ARP with antibodies to any specific small nuclear RNP antigen was observed. The most striking finding was that recurrent infections, both in LE patients and in those with CBFP reactions and widespread, acral discoid skin lesions, occurred significantly more often in ARP-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of antibodies reacting with human retroviral proteins is associated with severe skin lesions and recurrent infections in SLE, DLE, and MCTD patients, and with a disposition toward developing systemic disease in CBFP reactors.","['Ranki, A', 'Kurki, P', 'Riepponen, S', 'Stephansson, E']","['Ranki A', 'Kurki P', 'Riepponen S', 'Stephansson E']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (snRNP Core Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/*analysis/immunology', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/analysis/immunology', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Child', 'Connective Tissue Diseases/epidemiology/*immunology', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'HIV Antibodies/analysis/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid/epidemiology/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/epidemiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease/epidemiology/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'snRNP Core Proteins']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1992 Dec;35(12):1483-91. doi: 10.1002/art.1780351212.,,['10.1002/art.1780351212 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These differentiated cells had an elevated phospholipase A2 activity and an increased capacity to synthesize a variety of eicosanoids, including both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products. Phospholipase A2-mediated release of arachidonic acid is accompanied by an equimolar production of potentially cytotoxic lysophospholipid. In association with the differentiation process, there was a 2-3-fold increase in lysophospholipase activity. Subsequent studies were undertaken to identify and characterize the lysophospholipases in this cell system, with 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as substrate. Hydrophobic chromatography of both undifferentiated and differentiated cell extracts revealed three peaks of enzyme activity. Extracts of differentiated cells contained a dramatic increase in activity contained in peak 2. The increase in enzymic activity of peak 2 appeared to account for the increase in total lysophospholipase activity found in the differentiated cell homogenates. The lysophospholipases contained in peaks 2 and 3 were purified to homogeneity and were 20 and 22 kDa respectively, as determined by denaturing polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Peaks 2 and 3 were similar on the basis of amino acid composition, but had distinctive C-terminal peptide amino acid sequences. Enzymic characterization of these proteins demonstrated that there was no detectable level of non-specific esterase, acyltransferase or transacylase activity associated with these proteins. We concluded that peak 2 lysophospholipase is regulated by differentiation in HL-60 cells and may play an important role in protecting these cells from the cytolytic effects of the lysophospholipids produced by the activation of phospholipase A2.","['Garsetti, D', 'Holtsberg, F', 'Steiner, M R', 'Egan, R W', 'Clark, M A']","['Garsetti D', 'Holtsberg F', 'Steiner MR', 'Egan RW', 'Clark MA']","['Schering-Plough Research, Bloomfield, NJ 07003.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (Lysophospholipase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lysophospholipase/metabolism/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism/physiology', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1992 Dec 15;288 ( Pt 3):831-7. doi: 10.1042/bj2880831.,,['10.1042/bj2880831 [doi]'],,,,PMC1131962,,,,,,,,,,,

Mild side effects related to GM-CSF were seen in six patients, of whom one chose to discontinue treatment. Compared to a historic control group consisting of six patients treated with an identical conditioning regimen, a tendency was seen towards a more rapid neutrophil regeneration and a decreased need for erythrocyte transfusions. Moreover, a statistically significant improvement in thrombocyte related parameters was demonstrated. In contrast, there were no significant differences in severe toxicity, days on i.v. antibiotics, septic episodes or duration of hospitalization.

The right-based approach is discussed, but sufficiently precise definitions seem hard to formulate.

These are multifaceted and must be taken into account when trying to control hemorrhage or thrombosis in cancer patients. Often, hemorrhage or thrombosis is the final fatal event in many patients with metastatic solid tumor or hematologic malignancies. Patients with malignancy present a major clinical challenge in this new era of oncologic awareness and more aggressive care, which has led to prolonged survival for patients and a longer time frame during which these complications may develop. Therefore, these complications are occurring more commonly. It is important to realize that these alterations of hemostasis exist and must be approached in a sequential and logical manner with respect to diagnosis; only in this way can responsible, efficacious, and rational therapy be delivered to patients. By far the most common alteration of hemostasis in malignancy is that of hemorrhage associated with thrombocytopenia, either drug-induced, radiation-induced, or from bone marrow invasion. However, hemorrhage resulting from DIC is also quite common and may present as hemorrhage, thrombosis, thromboembolus, or any combination thereof. Many antineoplastic drugs and radiation therapy may lead to or significantly enhance hemorrhage in patients with malignancy. Thrombosis, also commonly seen in patients with malignancy, is often a manifestation of low-grade DIC, conspicuous as an intravascular thrombotic or thromboembolic event instead of an intravascular proteolytic (hemorrhagic) event. When suspecting this, confirmatory laboratory evidence must be sought and the patient treated appropriately. When approaching the patient with malignancy and either hemorrhage or thrombosis, all the potential defects in hemostasis must be taken into account, defined from the laboratory standpoint, and treated in as precise and logical manner as possible.","['Bick, R L']",['Bick RL'],"['Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,,IM,"['Blood Coagulation Disorders/*etiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/diagnosis/etiology', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', '*Hemostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/complications', 'Neoplasms/*blood/complications/etiology', 'Thrombosis/etiology/physiopathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 1992;18(4):353-72. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1002575.,,['10.1055/s-2007-1002575 [doi]'],,,195,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agonist activation of either receptor stimulated binding of the GTP analog, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]), to membrane G proteins and by a similar extent in a non-additive manner. The possible interaction of the two receptors was studied by measuring agonist binding to one receptor in the presence of the other receptor agonist. fMet-Leu-Phe and C5a had no effects on [125I]C5a and fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe receptor binding, respectively, when studied in the absence of regulatory ligands. Similarly, the inhibitory effects of NaCl and GDP on agonist receptor binding were not altered in the presence of the other receptor agonist. In contrast, in the presence of the GTP analogs, GTP[S] and guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imino] triphosphate, fMet-Leu-Phe and C5a reduced the binding of [125I]C5a and fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe, respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. The potencies of the GTP analogs to inhibit binding of [125I]C5a and fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe was increased about 3-fold by fMet-Leu-Phe and C5a, respectively. The data presented suggest that fMet-Leu-Phe and C5a receptors share the same G protein pool in membranes of HL 60 cells and that activation of these G proteins by one of the two receptors decreases the availability of G proteins for the other receptor.","['Wieland, T', 'Gierschik, P', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Wieland T', 'Gierschik P', 'Jakobs KH']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitat GH Essen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chemotactic Factors/*metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*physiology', 'Complement C5a/metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism"", 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 1992 Nov;346(5):475-81. doi: 10.1007/BF00168999.,,['10.1007/BF00168999 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six patients had blasts which co-expressed markers for lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, and which were therefore defined as biphenotypic hybrid acute leukaemia. Of the six, three patients were in the paediatric age group (below 12 years old) while the other three were more than 12 years old. Peripheral blood counts were variable; however, bone marrow infiltration was extensive (blasts > or = 75% in all). At the time of study, remission was achieved in only two patients. The authors' data show that biphenotypic hybrid acute leukaemia is not rare in Malaysia. This represents a subgroup of acute leukaemia identifiable by immunophenotyping but not by the French-American-British classification based on morphological and basic cytochemical studies alone.

We have previously reported hypercalcemic patients with solid tumors to excrete a large amount of the C-terminal fragments of PTHrP (C-PTHrP) into their urine. To elucidate whether PTHrP production correlates with or predicts the development of hypercalcemia, we studied the urinary excretion of C-PTHrP in 36 ATL patients. The urinary excretion of C-PTHrP was in the normal range (< 0.40 nmol equivalent to PTHrP (109-141)/g creatinine) in HTLV-1-positive carriers (n 3), ATL patients in complete remission (n 2) and chronic type ATL patients (n 2). It was marginally increased in seven patients in partial remission, and gradually increased as the disease progressed. In 20 patients who died without or with hypercalcemia, it was increased to 1.98 +/- 0.69 (n 9) and 7.6 +/- 2.1 nmol/g creatinine (mean +/- SD, n 11, P < 0.01), respectively. Urinary C-PTHrP excretion was significantly correlated with serum calcium and LDH levels as well as with CD25-positive cells in the peripheral blood. In four patients whose urinary excretion had been serially determined, it increased prior to the development of hypercalcemia. The findings suggest the urinary excretion of C-PTHrP to be of use as a predictor of the development of hypercalcemia in ATL patients. In ATL patients whose urinary excretion of C-PTHrP is progressively increasing, the serum calcium concentration should be carefully monitored to prevent hypercalcemic crisis.","['Imamura, H', 'Koreeda, Y', 'Okadome, T', 'Tara, M', 'Niina, K', 'Shizume, K', 'Ohsumi, K', 'Sato, K']","['Imamura H', 'Koreeda Y', 'Okadome T', 'Tara M', 'Niina K', 'Shizume K', 'Ohsumi K', 'Sato K']","['Internal Medicine, Kagoshima Municipal Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*urine', 'Calcium/blood', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/complications/urine', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/*complications/*urine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*urine', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*urine', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Remission Induction']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1992 Oct;22(5):325-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF stimulated an increase in the number of newly differentiated neurons, without inducing proliferation of the precursors. Given that LIF has previously reported effects as a cholinergic switching factor for sympathetic neurons, we investigated whether LIF had similar effects in these spinal cord cultures.

In addition, because leukemic transformation and growth may amplify B cell clones regardless of selection by antigen, analysis of rearranged Ig genes in leukemic clones may give insight into molecular events taking place during the ontogenesis of normal B cells. We have tested DNA samples from patients with chronic B cell leukemias in search for abnormal rearrangements of the Ig heavy chain gene region. By Southern blot analysis we found an unexpected break in the JH-C mu region in 7 out of 118 cases. Two of these cases were investigated in detail by constructing from each a phage genomic library and isolating the phage clones containing the break points. In both cases the JH-C mu separation was confirmed. Further analysis demonstrated that in both cases the abnormality was an inversion of the Ig heavy chain gene between C mu and one of the C gamma segments. This inversion structure strongly suggests that, as has been demonstrated in murine cell lines and in splenocytes stimulated in vitro, class switching in human B lymphocytes occurs in vivo via a loop-out deletion mechanism. The frequency of abnormal events may be as high as 15%. Our data indicate that a proportion of cases of chronic B cell leukemia arise from a cell which has attempted an Ig class switch.","['Laffan, M', 'Luzzatto, L']","['Laffan M', 'Luzzatto L']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, Switch', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Dec;90(6):2299-303. doi: 10.1172/JCI116117.,,['10.1172/JCI116117 [doi]'],,,,PMC443382,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a human promonocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, we have shown that TGF-beta inhibits their proliferation and promotes differentiation into cells exhibiting macrophage-like properties. Therefore, a key question is whether TGF-beta influences the expression of genes associated with proliferation and/or growth inhibition. TGF-beta treatment of THP-1 cells results in downregulation of expression of c-myc. We also observe that TGF-beta 1-treated cells express reduced levels of the cell cycle regulated histone, H2B, but express elevated levels of an RNA splicing variant of this histone that has been observed to be upregulated in growth inhibited and terminally differentiated cells. In addition, a nuclear protein associated with senescence and withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle, statin, is also expressed by THP-1 cells in response to TGF-beta 1 treatment. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 is capable of inducing expression of specific nuclear proteins associated with differentiation and/or cessation of proliferation that may result in changes in nuclear organization and altered gene expression. Such changes in nuclear organization may be incompatible with continued proliferation of the cells.","['Ignotz, R A']",['Ignotz RA'],"['Department of Cell Biology, University Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EEF1A2 protein, human)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1992 Nov;50(3):285-92. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240500309.,,['10.1002/jcb.240500309 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both complications likely result from tissue necrosis, although how such injury occurs is unknown. To investigate mechanisms of tissue destruction in P carinii pneumonia, histochemical, immunocytochemical, and electron microscopic studies were conducted in pulmonary wedge resections or autopsy specimens from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 7) or leukemia (n = 2). Tissue invasion, defined as Pneumocystis organisms in the interstitial compartment, was present in eight of nine cases. Organisms were found in alveolar septa (eight cases), pleura (six cases), and vessel walls (two cases). All cases with tissue invasion exhibited regional necrosis as well as extensive invasion of apparently viable parenchyma. Pulmonary cavitation occurred in seven of eight cases with tissue invasion, and six of these patients developed pneumothoraces. Despite extensive tissue invasion and necrosis there was little host inflammatory or stromal response. Ultrastructurally, both the tissue-invasive and intra-alveolar organisms were predominantly of the trophozoite form; they were present in much greater numbers than suggested by routine silver stains (which detect only cysts). Immunocytochemical techniques, which detect both trophozoite and cyst forms, were much more sensitive than silver stains.

In one patient the MALT lymphoma in the salivary gland was microscopic. In another, the small bowel lymphoma, which preceded the monocytoid B-cell lymphoma by 11 years, showed different clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. Attention is drawn to the extreme degree of plasmacytic differentiation and epithelioid cell infiltration that may occur in monocytoid B-cell lymphoma. In addition to the cytological and immunophenotypic likeness of monocytoid B-cells and centrocyte-like cells, monocytoid B-cell and MALT lymphomas share a number of micro-anatomical and behavioural characteristics. These include the sharp separation of the monocytoid B-cells and plasma cells, follicular colonization and progression to high-grade lymphoma. It is suggested that the frequent association of monocytoid B-cell lymphoma with Sjogren's syndrome may be due to the fact that the salivary glands drain to cervical lymph nodes that are part of the systemic, rather than the mucosal, lymphocyte circulation pathway.","['Ortiz-Hidalgo, C', 'Wright, D H']","['Ortiz-Hidalgo C', 'Wright DH']","['Department of Pathology, Southampton General Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications', 'Biomarkers', 'Epithelioid Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/complications/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma Cells/pathology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 1992 Dec;21(6):555-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1992.tb00444.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1992.tb00444.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As for the severity of DIC, in mild DIC, both thrombin and plasmin activities were increased. In moderate DIC, the TAT/PAP ratio increased, and thrombin activity was much more predominant. However, in severe DIC, the ratio decreased, and plasmin activity became excessive. In 3 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, APL and pancreatic cancer, respectively, the PAP level remained high during heparin therapy although the TAT level was decreased. When tranexamic acid was given, the PAP level was selectively reduced, and the TAT/PAP ratio was markedly decreased along with clinical improvement.

Two of six AML adherent layers were deficient in composition (i.e., no confluency, reduced numbers of macrophages and fibroblastic progenitors, and no fat cell formation), resulting in reduced CSF-1 production and a poor hemopoietic supportive capacity (assessed by the ability of an irradiated stroma to sustain the growth of myeloid, erythroid, and multipotential progenitors derived from a second innoculum of normal bone marrow). Four out of six AML adherent layers showed levels of macrophages, fibroblastic progenitors, fat cells, and CSF-1 similar to those observed in adherent layers from normal bone marrow; however, their capacity to sustain normal hemopoiesis was still significantly reduced. The deficient hemopoietic supportive capacity of all AML adherent layers correlated with the presence of a soluble activity in the culture supernatant that inhibited hemopoietic colony formation. Addition of rhCSF-1 during the establishment of AML adherent layers significantly increased their hemopoietic supportive capacity. In contrast, the hemopoietic supportive capacity of normal adherent layers was reduced by rhCSF-1. The opposite effects of rhCSF-1 on the hemopoietic supportive capacity of normal and AML adherent layers correlated with the levels of the soluble inhibitory activity, that is, increased levels in cultures containing rhCSF-1-treated normal adherent layers, and slightly reduced levels in cultures of rhCSF-1-treated AML layers. These results indicate that, despite a morphologically normal composition in most cases (four out of six), the hemopoietic microenvironment developed in long-term marrow culture (LTMC) from all AML marrows analyzed has a deficient hemopoietic supportive capacity, due, at least in part, to the production of hemopoietic inhibitor(s).

We studied the feasibility of this approach in an in vivo model for autologous BM transplantation using the murine leukemia cell line P388 and its MDR variant P388/ADR. Colony-forming assays with 2-h drug exposure revealed a tumor selectivity of VP-16 for P388 cells compared to normal murine marrow granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), whereas P388/ADR cells were resistant to VP-16. Simultaneous incubation with CsA restored sensitivity in these cells. Almost 4 logs of cell kill were achieved by treating P388/ADR cells with 60 microM VP-16 plus 2.5 microM CsA (combination A) or 40 microM VP-16 plus 10 microM CsA (combination B), whereas there was a 2.5-log reduction of CFU-GM at these doses. Even though the myelotoxicity of VP-16 was increased by the addition of CsA, this effect was nonspecific as shown by a similar chemosensitization in sensitive P388 as well as in P388/VP 2.5 cells, an atypical MDR variant lacking P-glycoprotein. In vivo experiments addressed the ability of BM treated with VP-16 and CsA to rescue lethally irradiated mice and to purge leukemic cells. In total, 1/14 lethally irradiated mice died due to sepsis within 10 days after receiving 15 x 10(6) BM cells treated ex vivo with combination A in contrast to 1/4 for combination B. All 16 surviving animals demonstrated long-term engraftment. When simulated remission marrow contaminated with 0.1% P388/ADR was purged with VP-16 (60 microM) or CsA (2.5 microM) alone, all mice died from leukemia before day 16 after transplantation (median 14.3 and 12.2 days). In contrast, nine of ten animals receiving similar marrow purged with combination A survived > 60 days without any evidence of disease (p < 0.01).

When atypical lymphocytic cells are obtained in aspiration materials of the breast, past history and general examination are necessary for diagnosis. In some cases of leukemia with breast involvement, good outcomes are obtained. Therefore, earlier detection is necessary in order to begin suitable therapy earlier and to avoid unnecessary excisional biopsy in patients with leukemia and breast tumors. To achieve this it is also necessary to first take into consideration the possibility of metastasis or infiltration of leukemia, and second to prepare two types of specimen for Papanicolaou stain and Giemsa stain before operation.","['Miura, H', 'Konaka, C', 'Kawate, N', 'Kato, H', 'Miura, R', 'Ebihara, Y']","['Miura H', 'Konaka C', 'Kawate N', 'Kato H', 'Miura R', 'Ebihara Y']","['Department of Surgery, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology/*secondary/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 1992;8(6):605-8. doi: 10.1002/dc.2840080614.,,['10.1002/dc.2840080614 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-1 cells clonally expand with age and are the malignant cell in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this report immunological analysis of B-1 malignancies in NZB mice, a murine model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, is related to current information on B-1 cells. B-1 clones from NZB mice produce high levels of interleukin-10, detected at the RNA level by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the B-1 malignant clones in NZB mice and their hybrids, are negative for B220/6B2 expression, the B-specific antigenic form of CD45 which is a membrane-associated phosphatase involved in lymphocyte activation. Both the autocrine production by B-1 cells of interleukin-10 and altered CD45 expression may be responsible for the clonal expansion of these cells, as well as the accompanying T cell expansion. We report the establishment of an in vitro cytotoxic CD8+ T cell line derived from an NZB with a B-1 malignancy. The effect of B-1 cell-derived interleukin-10 on subsets of T lymphocytes may account for the immunoregulatory properties of B-1 cells. In addition, the NZB malignancies were also characterized for immunoglobulin variable region sequence and antigen specificity. The B-1 malignancies produced immunoglobulin derived from unmutated germline sequences with no N base substitutions. It appears that both the immunoglobulin and interleukin-10 produced by the B-1 malignant cell in NZB mice may have immunoregulatory properties. A study of B-1 malignancies may shed light on the immunoregulatory properties of non-clonally expanded normal B-1 cells.","['Raveche, E S', 'Phillips, J', 'Mahboudi, F', 'Dang, A', 'Fernandes, H', 'Ramachandra, S', 'Lin, T', 'Peng, B']","['Raveche ES', 'Phillips J', 'Mahboudi F', 'Dang A', 'Fernandes H', 'Ramachandra S', 'Lin T', 'Peng B']","['Department of Pathology, UMDNJ, New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Int J Clin Lab Res,International journal of clinical & laboratory research,9206491,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytokines/analysis/physiology', 'DNA/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Lab Res. 1992;22(4):220-34. doi: 10.1007/BF02591428.,,['10.1007/BF02591428 [doi]'],"['GENBANK/S45925', 'GENBANK/S51915', 'GENBANK/S51916', 'GENBANK/X64236', 'GENBANK/X64237', 'GENBANK/X64238', 'GENBANK/X64239', 'GENBANK/X64240', 'GENBANK/X64241', 'GENBANK/X64242']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms underlying leukemic relapse represent the most exciting and controversial aspects of autologous bone marrow transplantation. At least three factors may be responsible for leukemic relapse in patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation: (1) minimal residual disease; (2) leukemic cells reinfused with the graft; (3) the lack of a graft-versus-leukemia effect.

We prospectively investigated the role of different pretransplant conditioning regimens in 29 leukemic patients post-BMT by assessing myeloid and T-cell chimerism using a rapid and sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Minisatellites are hypervariable regions of DNA consisting of tandem repeats of a core nucleotide sequence, and allelic polymorphism results from differences in the number of the repeats. We used this variation to distinguish between donor and recipient cells post-BMT. Seventeen patients (9 sibling and 8 unrelated donors) received conditioning with hyperfractionated total body irradiation (TBI), thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide (Cy). Of the other 12 patients (all sibling donors), 11 received TBI plus Cy plus another agent: VP16, carboplatinum, or AZQ. One patient received TBI plus thiotepa plus VP16. All but one of the patients studied received marrow from HLA-identical donors. PCR analysis confirmed donor lymphoid engraftment within 8 days of transplant in six of six patients studied. All granulocyte DNA was of donor origin within the first 4 weeks of transplant, regardless of the conditioning regimen. The day +28 T cells were exclusively of donor origin in 14 of 17 patients who received TBI plus thiotepa plus Cy, but were mixed chimeric in 10 of 12 patients who received other conditioning regimens (P < .001). Early graft rejection was seen in one unrelated transplant recipient conditioned with TBI plus thiotepa plus Cy. Late graft failure was observed in 3 of 12 patients with mixed T-cell chimerism and in none of 16 patients with full donor chimerism at day +28. However, 5 of 16 patients who had complete T-cell chimerism at day +28 developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas no patient with mixed chimerism had acute GVHD. Our results indicate that minisatellite PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for assessing chimerism post-BMT, that the donor T cells are important for consistent durable engraftment, and that TBI plus thiotepa plus Cy may be superior to the other regimens studied in inducing full donor chimerism. Larger numbers and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm these data and also to assess the relationship between complete donor T-cell chimerism and leukemia-free survival.","['Mackinnon, S', 'Barnett, L', 'Bourhis, J H', 'Black, P', 'Heller, G', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Mackinnon S', 'Barnett L', 'Bourhis JH', 'Black P', 'Heller G', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*physiology', 'Child', 'Chimera', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Satellite/*genetics', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology/surgery/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 15;80(12):3235-41.,,['S0006-4971(20)85925-4 [pii]'],,,,,['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Its proliferation is strictly dependent on the presence of hematopoietic growth factors including erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-3 (IL-3). We investigated the differentiation capacities of this cell line under the action of several growth factors, using immunomarkers, flow cytometry, and ultrastructural techniques. In the presence of GM-CSF and IL-3, eosinophil and basophil promyelocytes were detected, as well as a few cells with erythroid and megakaryocytic (MK) differentiation features. In contrast, Epo induced a marked erythroid differentiation with an increase of glycophorin A expression, accompanied by a few hemoglobinized cells. Differentiation induced by the growth factors took 24 to 48 hours to begin, and increased with cell passages to a plateau at 2 weeks of culture. However, this was not only due to a cell selection because the differential effects of Epo and GM-CSF were observed from a single cell clone and the phenotype could be reversed by opposite growth factors, even after a long period of culture. We subsequently investigated the phenotype of UT-7 in the presence of combinations of Epo, IL-3, and GM-CSF, and showed that GM-CSF and IL-3 act predominantly over Epo. This effect was mediated by a rapid downmodulation of Epo receptors by GM-CSF at messenger RNA and binding sites levels, without a change in receptor affinities. On the other hand, Epo had no effect on number and affinity of GM-CSF receptors. This study shows that UT-7 is a growth factor-dependent pluripotent cell line in which commitment may be directed by a hierarchical action of growth factors through an early and rapid transmodulation of growth factor receptors.","['Hermine, O', 'Mayeux, P', 'Titeux, M', 'Mitjavila, M T', 'Casadevall, N', 'Guichard, J', 'Komatsu, N', 'Suda, T', 'Miura, Y', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Hermine O', 'Mayeux P', 'Titeux M', 'Mitjavila MT', 'Casadevall N', 'Guichard J', 'Komatsu N', 'Suda T', 'Miura Y', 'Vainchenker W', 'et al.']","['INSERM U.91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Basophils/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eosinophils/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 15;80(12):3060-9.,,['S0006-4971(20)85905-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prospective study of the BCR-ABL fusion gene was begun on patients entered on clinical trials conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). All patients received intensive, multiagent chemotherapy that included daunorubicin. Over 2 years, 56 patients were studied for molecular evidence of a BCR-ABL gene using Southern blot and pulsed-field gel hybridization analysis. Results were compared with cytogenetic detection of a Ph1 chromosome, and clinical features were compared for the BCR-ABL-positive and -negative groups. Molecular methods detected the BCR-ABL gene in 30% of cases compared with cytogenetic detection of the Ph1 chromosome in only 23%. The majority of cases (76%) showed the p190 gene subtype similar to pediatric ALL; the BCR-ABL-positive cases displayed a more homogeneous immunophenotype than the BCR-ABL-negative cases and were predominantly CALLA positive (86%) and B-cell surface antigen positive (82%). The rate of achieving complete remission was similar in the BCR-ABL-positive and -negative groups (71% and 77%, respectively, P = .72). There were more early relapses in the BCR-ABL-positive group, resulting in a shorter remission duration that was especially marked in the CALLA-positive and B-cell antigen-positive populations. These preliminary data suggest that the impact of the BCR-ABL gene on clinical outcome in ALL may be on maintenance of complete remission (CR) rather than achievement of CR when aggressive, multiagent chemotherapy is used. This study identifies the BCR-ABL gene as an important factor in adult ALL and demonstrates the utility of molecular methods for its accurate diagnosis.","['Westbrook, C A', 'Hooberman, A L', 'Spino, C', 'Dodge, R K', 'Larson, R A', 'Davey, F', 'Wurster-Hill, D H', 'Sobol, R E', 'Schiffer, C', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Westbrook CA', 'Hooberman AL', 'Spino C', 'Dodge RK', 'Larson RA', 'Davey F', 'Wurster-Hill DH', 'Sobol RE', 'Schiffer C', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 15;80(12):2983-90.,,['S0006-4971(20)85897-2 [pii]'],,,,,"['CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Two hundred twenty-seven patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia were enrolled on two sequential studies conducted from 1982 to 1991. One hundred fifty-one patients (67%) achieved a complete remission. One hundred twenty-three patients were eligible for high-dose cytarabine-based consolidation administered in two to three courses. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 40 patients remain alive, with 28 in continued remission. Median remission duration for all eligible patients is 12.8 months, and actuarial leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 5 years is 26% +/- 8%. Advanced age and male sex were negative prognostic indicators for LFS. For patients < or = 45 years of age, 5-year LFS was 35% +/- 13%, as compared with 18% +/- 11% for patients greater than age 45 (P = .03). Toxicity of consolidation chemotherapy included treatment-related death in nine patients and serious neurotoxicity in five.

Patients with APL achieved complete remission within 1-3 months by a progressive maturation of leukemic cells. The advantages of this differentiation therapy are the rapid disappearance of the bleeding disorders and the absence of aplastic phase avoiding the early deaths occurring in 15-30% of patients with conventional chemotherapy. However, relapses occurred when ATRA alone was maintained. For this reason, a chemotherapy is added after complete remission obtained by ATRA. A pilot study on 27 patients was proposed with the sequential combination of ATRA and chemotherapy. A European trial randomizes conventional therapy to the sequential ATRA-chemotherapy protocol. Retinoic acid receptor (RAR alpha) is rearranged by the specific translocation t(15;17) of APL; a PCR technique was developed in order to ensure the diagnosis and to follow the minimal residual disease. Transfection experiment of the chimaeric gene inhibits the transactivation of the natural RAR. ATRA is able to revert the arrest of maturation perhaps through an increase of the expression of the normal allele of RAR, which could overpass the impairment induced by the chimaeric protein on target responsive elements. One of the steps of the repair is the modulation of programmed cell death (PCD). Bcl-2, a gene involved in the PCD, is modulated in in vitro studies, arguing for the engagement of the cell in the natural death. The beneficial effect of differentiation therapy is probably due to the induction of the natural death of the malignant cell.","['Degos, L']",['Degos L'],"['Hopital St Louis, Service des Maladies du Sang, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1992;46(5-7):201-9. doi: 10.1016/0753-3322(92)90083-j.,,"['0753-3322(92)90083-J [pii]', '10.1016/0753-3322(92)90083-j [doi]']",,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now extended these studies to address the mechanism that may be responsible for this enhancement and have also examined a human leukemic cell line (HL-60) for its sensitivity to this combination cytotoxic-differentiation therapy. We found that in HL-60 cells, pretreatment with FUdR, but not FUra, followed by 1.2% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) led to an 8 to 10-fold enhancement of cell death as compared to FUdR alone. When all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was used instead of DMSO, the enhancement of differentiation and cytotoxicity was 5-fold. The percent of cells induced to differentiate was dependent on the concentration of both FUdR and ATRA. In HL-60 cells resistant to ATRA-induced differentiation, the combination of FUdR and ATRA did not result in enhanced cytotoxicity. Leucovorin (LV), a compound known to enhance the inhibitory effect of FUra or FUdR on DNA synthesis, increased the effectiveness of the cytotoxic-differentiation therapy, whereas thymidine inhibited its effectiveness. This suggests that inhibition of DNA metabolism may be an integral part of the differentiation-enhancing cytotoxic mechanism. To further explore inhibition of DNA synthesis, DNA was extracted under alkaline or neutral conditions from 3H-thymidine-labelled cells that were treated with FUra/LV and HMBA individually or in combination. The emergence of single and double-strand DNA breaks was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. In parallel to the enhancement of cytotoxicity, the combination treatment (FUra/LV followed by HMBA) also produced a 2.5-3-fold increase in the DNA breaks when compared to the same effect obtained by the agents applied individually. Thus, we propose that DNA degradation may be the mechanism responsible for the enhanced loss of cell viability. In summary, we report here an approach which is targeted to increasing the death rate of leukemic cells through the combined use of low doses of cytotoxic drugs and differentiation inducers.","['Waxman, S', 'Huang, Y', 'Scher, B M', 'Scher, M']","['Waxman S', 'Huang Y', 'Scher BM', 'Scher M']","['Rochelle Belfer Chemotherapy Foundation Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Floxuridine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1992;46(5-7):183-92. doi: 10.1016/0753-3322(92)90081-h.,,"['0753-3322(92)90081-H [pii]', '10.1016/0753-3322(92)90081-h [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Affected individuals develop cancer at a young age and often at multiple primary sites. A study has been conducted into the genetic basis of cancer in a particular Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Examination of p53 as a candidate susceptibility gene revealed that, in two affected individuals, there was an aberrant larger transcript of 3.6 kilobases present in both tumor and constitutional material in addition to the normal-sized 2.8-kilobase transcript. The additional transcript was not found in three unaffected family members. S1 nuclease mapping localized the insertion toward the 5' end of the p53 transcript near exons 4 and 5, and sequencing revealed a point mutation in the splice donor site of intron 4 in the germ-line of the two affected individuals, which accounted for the presence of the larger transcript. The same splicing mutation was also detected in two obligate carriers and was not found in two unaffected individuals. As no mutations were detected in exons 5-8 in either tumor examined, the second p53 allele was most likely lost during tumorigenesis in both tumors. The demonstration of a germ-line splicing mutation in affected individuals from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family provides for a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation not seen previously in other affected families, in whom the mutations have all been missense.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Warneford, S G', 'Witton, L J', 'Townsend, M L', 'Rowe, P B', 'Reddel, R R', 'Dalla-Pozza, L', 'Symonds, G']","['Warneford SG', 'Witton LJ', 'Townsend ML', 'Rowe PB', 'Reddel RR', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'Symonds G']","[""Leukemia Research and Viral Pathology Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Carcinoma/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*RNA Splicing', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1992 Nov;3(11):839-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I has been implicated in a chronic progressive myelopathy, known as tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM). We sought to determine whether autoantibodies to brain antigens were present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient with chronic progressive spastic myelopathy with evidence of both HIV-1 infection and HTLV-I/II seropositivity. DESIGN: A 54-year-old bisexual man with clinical features of HAM/TSP of over 20 years' duration was followed. METHODS: We applied discriminatory DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction) to distinguish HTLV-I from HTLV-II and to verify co-infection with HIV-1. The patient's CSF was used to screen a human brain cDNA expression library to identify antibodies directed against brain antigens. Autoreactive bacteriophage clones were isolated and sequenced. RESULTS: The patient was found to be co-infected with both HIV-1 and HTLV-II, but not with HTLV-I. HTLV-II proviral levels in the peripheral blood remained relatively constant, despite therapy with zidovudine. Prominent oligoclonal banding of immunoglobulins was present in the patient's CSF.

By use of flow cytometry and radioimmunoprecipitation, 1 of the MAB (c143) that recognized a tumor-associated antigen cross-reacted with blood lymphocytes (BL) from various mammalian species. By use of flow cytometry, the c143 MAB reacted with 10 to 49% of BL derived from human beings, mice, dogs, horses, pigs, llamas, sheep, goats, and cattle. Titer of the c143 MAB with BL from horses, pigs, human beings, and llamas ranged between 1:6.0 x 10(4) and 1:5.3 x 10(5); titer associated with BL of goats and sheep was 1:1.6 x 10(6); and that associated with BL of cattle was 1:4.3 x 10(7).

These results indicate that the avidity of the c143 MAB in binding to BL from ruminants (eg, goats, sheep, and cattle) is higher than that to BL from human beings, mice, dogs, horses, pigs, and llamas. In sheep, the c143 MAB could immunoprecipitate the aforementioned proteins from BL of the Suffolk breed, but not BL from the Corriedale breed, whereas the c143 MAB immunoprecipitated apparently identical proteins from BL of 4 breeds of cattle.","['Aida, Y', 'Okada, K', 'Kageyama, R', 'Amanuma, H']","['Aida Y', 'Okada K', 'Kageyama R', 'Amanuma H']","['Laboratory of Gene Technology and Safety, Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', '*Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Camelids, New World', 'Cattle', 'Cross Reactions', 'Dogs', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goats', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay', 'Sheep', 'Swine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 1992 Nov;53(11):1988-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 9 of the 47 patients, PNH was associated with another clonal myelopathy. Five patients had PNH and a myelodysplastic syndrome, and four had PNH and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. PNH preceded the development of myelodysplastic syndrome but occurred after the development of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. This is the largest series of PNH and other clonal myelopathies.

Their prognostic relevance in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is unknown. We analyzed the associations of serum beta 2M levels at diagnosis with pretreatment characteristics and with prognosis in adult ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-nine adults with newly diagnosed ALL were investigated. Serum beta 2M levels were determined at diagnosis, on fresh peripheral blood samples, using a radioimmunoassay, the Pharmacia beta 2 Micro RIA (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). Statistical correlations were assessed by standard methods, and further independent prognostic value of serum beta 2M was determined by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Patients with beta 2M levels of 4.0 mg/L or above had a lower complete response rate (61% versus 80%; p = 0.02), a significantly worse survival (p < 0.01), and a significantly higher association with development of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia (p < 0.01). High beta 2M levels were more common among patients with older age, with elevated creatinine, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, with low albumin levels, and with B-cell disease. Multivariate analysis for survival indicated the beta 2M level to be an independent prognostic variable (after adjusting for pretreatment creatinine level and age). The evaluation of beta 2M levels within low- and high-risk groups for CNS disease suggested an association of elevated beta 2M levels with a worse incidence of CNS disease in the high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Monitoring serum beta 2M levels may provide significant prognostic information in adults with ALL and should be included in their pretreatment evaluation. Its importance in childhood ALL requires investigation.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Smith, T', 'Estey, E', 'Polyzos, A', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Pierce, S', 'Beran, M', 'Feldman, E', 'Keating, M J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Smith T', 'Estey E', 'Polyzos A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Pierce S', 'Beran M', 'Feldman E', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Hematology, Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/secondary', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum Albumin/analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Texas/epidemiology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*analysis']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1992 Dec;93(6):599-604. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(92)90191-d.,,"['0002-9343(92)90191-D [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(92)90191-d [doi]']",,,,,,,['Am J Med. 1994 Apr;96(4):396.

In 25 patients with aneuploid myeloma, we found a small component of cells which had aneuploid DNA content without Cyt-Ig in addition to myeloma cells showing aneuploidy with Cyt-Ig. These aneuploid Cyt-Ig-negative cells were considered to be clonally involved because they were aneuploid, and detected predominantly in patients with stage III myeloma.

They have been reported to suppress bone marrow (BM) progenitor cell activity (PCA) in vitro, thus raising concern about the feasibility of their use after autologous bone marrow transplantation. The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of LAK cells on BM engraftment in a syngeneic BMT setting in mice. LAK cells supplemented with or without exogenous interleukin-2 therapy did not impair the hematopoietic reconstitution or survival of mice undergoing BMT. LAK cells also did not reduce the PCA of the engrafted BM. LAK cell therapy did not cause graft-versus-host disease. Finally, LAK cells supplemented with IL-2 therapy improved the graft-versus-leukemia effect. These findings suggest that LAK cells plus IL-2 therapy after BMT does not impede hematopoiesis and should be evaluated as an adjuvant therapy with the aim of eradication of minimal residual disease after autologous BMT.","['Charak, B S', 'Brynes, R K', 'Chogyoji, M', 'Mazumder, A']","['Charak BS', 'Brynes RK', 'Chogyoji M', 'Mazumder A']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. 20007.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*cytology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1992 Dec;54(6):1008-13. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199212000-00013.,,['10.1097/00007890-199212000-00013 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An 81-base-pair deletion was introduced into the p15E-encoding region of the env gene of an otherwise replication-competent molecular clone of the FMuLV provirus. After transfection of this clone into cells that package the viral RNA in MuLV coats, infectious virus was released into the culture medium. Mouse fibroblasts infected with this virus, here called delta FMuLV, expressed the truncated viral env gene products in their cytoplasm but not on cell surfaces, and culture fluids from these cells did not transmit the infection to fresh mouse fibroblasts. In preliminary experiments, immunization of mice of H-2-congenic BALB/c strains with delta FMuLV conferred levels of immunity to FV disease ranging from weak to relatively strong. Immunized mice developed anti-FV IgM and IgG antibodies and cytotoxic T cells. Mice observed for 15 weeks after the first of two immunizations showed no detectable pathology, but delta FMuLV DNA was detectable in livers of some immunized mice for at least 3-6 weeks.

We have identified the gene located at this break-point and have named it MLL (for myeloid-lymphoid, or mixed-lineage, leukemia). The t(4;11), t(6;11), t(9;11), and t(11;19) are among the most common reciprocal translocations in leukemia cells involving this chromosomal band. We now have evidence that the breakpoints in all of these translocations are clustered within a 9-kilobase (kb) BamHI genomic region of the MLL gene. By Southern blot hybridization using a 0.7-kb BamHI cDNA fragment of the MLL gene called MLL 0.7B, we have detected rearrangements of DNA from cell lines and patient material with an 11q23 translocation in this region. Northern blot analyses indicate that this gene has multiple transcripts, some of which appear to be lineage-specific. In normal pre-B cells, four transcripts of 12.5, 12.0, 11.5, and 2.0 kb are detected. These transcripts are also present in monocytoid cell lines with additional hybridization to a 5.0-kb transcript, indicating that expression of different-sized MLL transcripts may be associated with normal hematopoietic lineage development. In a cell line with a t(4;11), the expression of the 12.5-, 12.0-, and 11.5-kb transcripts is reduced, and there is evidence of three other altered transcripts of 11.5, 11.25, and 11.0 kb. Thus, these 11q23 translocations result in rearrangements of the MLL gene and may lead to altered function(s) of MLL and of other gene(s) involved in the translocation.","['McCabe, N R', 'Burnett, R C', 'Gill, H J', 'Thirman, M J', 'Mbangkollo, D', 'Kipiniak, M', 'van Melle, E', 'Ziemin-van der Poel, S', 'Rowley, J D', 'Diaz, M O']","['McCabe NR', 'Burnett RC', 'Gill HJ', 'Thirman MJ', 'Mbangkollo D', 'Kipiniak M', 'van Melle E', 'Ziemin-van der Poel S', 'Rowley JD', 'Diaz MO']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Dec 15;89(24):11794-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.24.11794.,,['10.1073/pnas.89.24.11794 [doi]'],,['MLL'],,PMC50643,"['5T32 CA09273-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

A variable proportion of CD16-negative neutrophils were found both in CML patients in chronic phase (3 out of 8 patients) and in CML patients in hematological remission (3 out of 9 patients). Neutrophils with reduced FcRIII expression showed more defective chemiluminescence and phagocytosis than neutrophils with normal FcRIII expression. Circulating myeloid cells from three patients in chronic phase, showing a normal percentage of CD16-positive neutrophils, were isolated and fractionated by discontinuous Percoll gradients. This study showed that CD16 appears at the stage of metamyelocyte, that band cells and segmented neutrophils display an identical pattern of membrane FcRIII, and that the fluorescence intensity shown by metamyelocytes is different from that displayed by more mature cells. The association between low FcRIII expression and function abnormality could be suggestive of a defect in CML neutrophil maturation.","['Carulli, G', 'Gianfaldoni, M L', 'Azzara, A', 'Papineschi, F', 'Vanacore, R', 'Minnucci, S', 'Testi, R', 'Ambrogi, F']","['Carulli G', 'Gianfaldoni ML', 'Azzara A', 'Papineschi F', 'Vanacore R', 'Minnucci S', 'Testi R', 'Ambrogi F']","['Unit of Hematology, Medical Clinic 1, University of Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Receptors, IgG/*analysis']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992 Dec;16(12):1203-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90120-v.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90120-v [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pattern of segregation was found between males and females and between black and white children. Black males, who are the worst prognostic group, had the lowest CD10 density, while white females, known to constitute the best prognostic group, had significantly higher CD10 antigen density than the other groups. Black females and white males occupied intermediate positions with respect to CD10 antigen density. A two way analysis of variance showed that although sex had contributed significantly to this variation (p = 0.0038), the contribution of race was marginal (p = 0.0530).

The effect of interleukin 4(IL-4) on the proliferation of Mm cells in the presence or absence of growth inhibitory substances was investigated. In semi-solid agar culture, IL-4 markedly inhibited colony formation by Mm cells, reducing the number of colonies to 50% of that in control cultures at concentration of 3 U/ml. In contrast, IL-4 did not inhibit colony formation by the parent M1 cells. In liquid culture, IL-4 alone inhibited the proliferation of Mm cells only slightly. However, a combination of IL-4 and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), which alone did not inhibit growth significantly, markedly inhibited the growth of Mm cells. This combination also increased the lysozyme activity of Mm cells significantly. On the other hand, IL-4 suppressed the antiproliferative effects of interferon alpha, beta and IL-6, which are growth inhibitory cytokines for these Mm cells.

This review focuses on current strategies designed to improve treatment outcome. With advances in molecular biology, the definition of a complete remission should be redefined as a molecular remission where any abnormal gene rearrangement has disappeared or a clonal remission with morphologic characteristics of a complete remission, but with detectable genetics or molecular abnormalities. Abnormal gene rearrangements permit the detection of minimal residual disease, the significance of which remains to be determined. New drug development remains an important area of research and several new drugs are active in acute myelogenous leukemia. These include etoposide, idarubicin, mitoxantrone and carboplatin. Various combinations are undergoing clinical trials. Prognostic factors which predict for outcome include phenotyping, cytogenetics, cytokinetics, drug resistance and age. Proto-oncogene expression as a predictor of response is under investigation. Post-induction therapy remains controversial and approaches have included allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, autologous bone marrow transplantation with or without purging, intensive consolidation and maintenance programs. The superiority of one approach over the other has not been firmly established.

There is little information available on the response of NF kappa B to cytokines in normal human monocytes. We have used a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) long terminal repeat, which contains a tandem repeat of the NF kappa B binding sequence, as a probe in a gel retardation assay to study this transcription factor. Using this assay, we have detected NF kappa B in extracts of nuclei from normal human monocytes. Treatment of normal monocytes with 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 4-24 h caused the complete disappearance of NF kappa B from nuclear extracts of monocytes. A similar result was obtained with the mature monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. The constitutive transcription factor SP1 was unaffected by addition of TPA. The disappearance of NF kappa B from the nucleus was concentration dependent between 10 and 50 ng/ml of phorbol ester. In THP-1 cells, TPA also induced a new, faster-migrating NF kappa B species not induced in monocytes. Protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, but not cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor HA-1004, also dramatically reduced constitutive levels of nuclear NF kappa B. Finally, TPA addition to monocytes infected with HIV-1 inhibited HIV-1 replication, as determined by reverse transcriptase assays, in a concentration-dependent manner. These results are in striking contrast to the increase in nuclear NF kappa B and HIV-1 replication induced by phorbol esters in promonocytic leukemia cells U937 and HL-60, and emphasize the importance of studying cytokine regulation of HIV-1 in normal monocytes.","['Mufson, R A', 'Myers, C', 'Turpin, J A', 'Meltzer, M']","['Mufson RA', 'Myers C', 'Turpin JA', 'Meltzer M']","['Cell Biology Department, Jerome H.

Murine (RAW 264.7) and human (HL-60) cell monolayers were treated with 100 U/ml gamma-interferon (IFN) and cocultured with Lp in the presence and absence of NGMMA, a specific inhibitor of NO production.

This increased survival corresponded with an inhibition of NO production (5.65 +/- 2.99 microM with NGMMA vs. 58.6 +/- 5.36 microM without NGMMA). Viable Lp were susceptible to killing, in a dose-dependent fashion, by 0, 2.5, and 5.0 mM sodium nitroprusside, a source of NO radicals. IFN-treated RAW 264.7 cells also had significantly decreased levels of intracellular iron (below assay limit) when compared to IFN+NGMMA-treated cells (72.0 +/- 0.78% of control). Normally permissive HL-60 cells treated with IFN were bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal, and NO production was not detected above background. Thus, NO radicals play a critical role in the bactericidal activity against Lp by IFN-treated RAW 264.7 cells, but the absence of NO production limits IFN-treated HL-60 cells to bacteriostasis.","['Summersgill, J T', 'Powell, L A', 'Buster, B L', 'Miller, R D', 'Ramirez, J A']","['Summersgill JT', 'Powell LA', 'Buster BL', 'Miller RD', 'Ramirez JA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Kentucky 40292.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Legionella pneumophila/*drug effects/growth & development', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Nitroprusside/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'omega-N-Methylarginine']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1992 Dec;52(6):625-9. doi: 10.1002/jlb.52.6.625.,,['10.1002/jlb.52.6.625 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of AA release by GTP gamma S and Ca2+ was mediated by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and required the presence of MgATP (EC50: 100-250 microM). The nucleotide effects were Ca(2+)-dependent (maximal effects detected at 1 microM free cation). UTP and ATP gamma S, which stimulate AA release in intact HL60 granulocytes with potencies and efficacies similar to those of ATP, were ineffective in supporting the effects of GTP gamma S in electropermeabilized cells. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin affected stimulation of AA release by ATP in intact cell, without altering the nucleotide effects in permeabilized cells. We observed the protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of PLA2 in permeabilized HL60 granulocytes, together with a correlation between the effects of phorbol esters and staurosporine on this reaction and on AA release. ATP-independent activation of PLA2 by GTP gamma S and/or Ca2+ was measured in subcellular fractions prepared from HL60 granulocytes. These data appear consistent with a model in which PLA2 activity in resting HL60 granulocytes is subjected to an inhibitory constraint that prevents its activation by Ca2+ and G-proteins. Removal of this constraint, either by the protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the enzyme in vivo or physical disruption of the regulatory assembly (e.g. by N2 cavitation), allows its activation by Ca2+ and G-proteins.","['Xing, M', 'Mattera, R']","['Xing M', 'Mattera R']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '12UHW9R67N (Isoflurophate)', '25612-73-1 (Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate/pharmacology', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*pharmacology"", 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Isoflurophate/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Models, Biological', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1992/12/25 00:00,1992/12/25 00:01,['1992/12/25 00:00'],"['1992/12/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Dec 25;267(36):25966-75.,,['S0021-9258(18)35703-X [pii]'],,,,,['GM 46552-01A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

These interactions have a potential impact on drug scheduling. Clinical trials of relapsed leukemia in which fludarabine (F-ara-A 5'-monophosphate) and ara-C were given in sequence provided the opportunity to evaluate the effects of ara-C infusion on two sequelae: the pharmacokinetics of F-ara-A in plasma and that of F-ara-ATP in leukemia cells. First, F-ara-A pharmacokinetics were altered by ara-C infusion. This was visualized as a transient increase in F-ara-A plasma levels during the ara-C infusion that was given 4 h after fludarabine. The perturbation in F-ara-A plasma levels was dependent on the dose ara-C. Second, peak F-ara-ATP concentrations were lower in leukemia cells of patients who received ara-C in addition to fludarabine as compared with those who received fludarabine alone. The terminal half-life of F-ara-A in plasma and the half-life of intracellular F-ara-ATP were reduced after the ara-C infusion in a concentration-dependent manner.

Seven patients had received HLA-matched sibling donor bone marrow transplants, five had received HLA-matched transplants from unrelated volunteer donors, and two had received one-antigen mismatched transplants from unrelated volunteer donors. At the time of MoAb BT 563 therapy, the overall clinical grading of acute GVHD (Seattle grading system) was as follows: grade II--one patient, grade III--four patients, and grade IV--nine patients. MoAb BT 563 was administered as a short iv infusion of 5 mg daily for 10 doses, followed by 5 mg on alternate days for a further five doses. A complete response (CR) was observed in four patients (28%), and a partial response (PR) in four patients (28%).

The dose of total body irradiation (TBI) prescribed to all patients (14.4 Gy) was calculated to compensate for the absence of T cells in the graft. The actual midline dose of TBI received, however, differed significantly depending on the method of TBI administration. Thus, 35 adult patients received an average midline dose of 14.3 Gy, while 13 children received a lower dose of 13 Gy. The incidence of MXC in the adult group, who had received very close to 14.4 Gy to the midline, was 34% (12/35), which is lower than in most reported T cell-depleted series. During follow-up, chimerism remained relatively stable with time but varied between haemopoietic lineages. There was no relationship with relapse. MXC in the 13 children who had received a lower midline TBI dose was significantly higher at 69% (9/13) (p < 0.05) and increased to 90% (9/10) if patients who received additional chemotherapy in their conditioning were excluded (p = 0.001). This suggests that, in terms of marrow ablation, relatively small changes in the dose of TBI may be biologically significant, at least at this dose range.

Many of them have shown activity in at least one cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant cell line, most commonly L1210 murine leukemia. In addition, most were less nephrotoxic than CDDP in preclinical evaluations. While these agents share certain key structural similarities, there are important differences in their toxicity profiles that may be exploitable in future combination therapies. Though neuropathy has been a troubling toxicity with two of the three diaminocyclohexane (DACH) compounds, it differs in that it appears to be less chronic and cumulative with oxaliplatin (I-OHP), which is also associated with much less myelosuppression. Of the cyclobutanedicarboxylato compounds that are structurally related to carboplatin (CBDCA), there are several notable differences. For several compounds, isolated neutropenia has been dose-limiting and thrombocytopenia, which is common with CBDCA, has been uncommon. Like CBDCA, neurotoxicity has not been an issue with this group. Therefore, the potential for dose escalation with a colony stimulating factor (CSF) appears enhanced. Furthermore, promising early clinical leads, such as the substantial response rates in cervix and head and neck cancers with 254-S and in patients with colon cancer using circadian modulation of I-OHP, require careful evaluation. Preclinical synergy data are also cited that suggest other potential clinical leads. The development of a number of these agents has been complicated by unanticipated issues, including unexpected chronic dose-limiting neurotoxicity with ormaplatin (OP), formulation and stability problems with liposomal-neodecanoato-diaminocyclohexane platinum (II) (L-NDDP), and problematic nephrotoxicity with zeniplatin (ZP). However, several of these new compounds are likely to enter broader phase II and III development and should provide important information not only about the utility of the agents themselves but also about the predictive value of some of these preclinical models of CDDP resistance.","['Christian, M C']",['Christian MC'],"['Investigational Drug Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclobutanes)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', '103775-75-3 (DWA 2114)', '110172-45-7 (NK 121)', '113427-19-3 (bis-neodecanoato-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum(II))', '40ZQ0A17IT (zeniplatin)', '8UQ3W6JXAN (nedaplatin)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'C7HT2IO79H (enloplatin)', 'OX5XK1JD8C (lobaplatin)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Cyclobutanes/therapeutic use', 'Drugs, Investigational/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Oxaliplatin']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1992 Dec;19(6):720-33.,,['0093-7754(92)90040-8 [pii]'],,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to this action, LIF was subsequently shown to inhibit the spontaneous differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells in culture, thus maintaining their pluripotency and ability to contribute to the germline of chimaeric mice. In the mouse, mRNA for LIF is expressed by the endometrial glands of the uterus coincident with the time of blastocyst implantation and receptors have been found on the preimplantation blastocyst. The signal for LIF expression appears to be of maternal origin, perhaps regulated by oestradiol. Recombinant LIF improves the development of murine and ovine blastocysts in culture although there is some species specificity with respect to the type of LIF that is bioactive. It is proposed here that LIF acts on the trophectoderm of the rapidly expanding blastocyst and improves the implantation rate of otherwise compromised embryos.

GM-CSF synthesis is regulated primarily by the ovarian steroid hormone oestrogen, but is also subject to modulation by factors including a seminal component of seminal vesicle origin which stimulates a 20-fold increase in luminal fluid content at mating, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the T-lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell product interferon-gamma (IFN gamma).

It is postulated that GM-CSF is of major importance to the physiology of pregnancy through its role as a component of a local cytokine circuit acting to recruit and regulate function of endometrial leukocytes, and by its action as interlocutor and important effector arm in embryo-maternal interactions during gestation.","['Robertson, S A', 'Seamark, R F']","['Robertson SA', 'Seamark RF']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Steroids)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Embryonic Development/*physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Steroids/pharmacology', 'Uterus/physiology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 1992;4(4):435-48. doi: 10.1071/rd9920435.,,['10.1071/rd9920435 [doi]'],,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results indicate that leu-enkephalin is rapidly degraded in the presence of these supernatants, and that enkephalin disappearance is paralleled by the formation of peptides that can be interpreted as its hydrolysis fragments. To characterize the factors involved in leu-enkephalin degradation, cell supernatants were analyzed by ion exchange and by steric exclusion chromatography. Data obtained indicate the presence of three groups of proteins active in leu-enkephalin degradation: aminopeptidases, dypeptidylaminopeptidases and dypeptidylcarboxypeptidases.

This review of the literature shows reasonable evidence suggesting that occupational exposure to phenoxy herbicides results in increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Several studies have noted large increases in risk of soft-tissue sarcomas with phenoxy herbicide exposure. In contrast, others have failed to observe increased risks, and evidence of an exposure-risk relationship is lacking. Although there have been too few appropriate studies for adequate assessment of risk of cancer at other sites, some findings have linked herbicide exposure with cancers of the colon, lung, nose, prostate, and ovary as well as to leukemia and multiple myeloma. Future studies must better identify and quantify the nature of herbicide exposures.

In non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, an excellent correlation was found between the percentage of IND.64-positive cells and the cytomorphological grade.

This study reports an attempt to infect and to immortalize NK cells with HTLV-I. Co-cultivation of freshly isolated NK cells with a HTLV-I-producing T cell line did not result in NK cell infection. However, NK cells activated with an anti-CD16 mAb and co-cultivated with a HTLV-I-producing T cell line were reproducibly infected by HTLV-I. HTLV-I infection was documented in NK cell lines and clones by the detection of defective integrated provirus by both Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Although HTLV-I-infected NK cells produced viral proteins, they did not produce infectious viral particles. HTLV-I-infected NK cells were phenotypically indistinguishable from their uninfected counterparts (CD16+, CD2+, CD56+, CD3-). They also retained the ability to mediate both natural and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. The IL-2-dependent proliferation of HTLV-I-infected NK cells was significantly greater than that of uninfected NK cells. The doubling time of this infected population was reduced from 9 days to 3 days, and the overall survival of the culture in the absence of restimulation was extended from 5 wk to 18 wk. Unlike T lymphocytes, HTLV-I-infected NK cells were not immortal, implying a fundamental difference between these two lymphocyte populations.","['Lo, K M', 'Vivier, E', 'Rochet, N', 'Dehni, G', 'Levine, H', 'Haseltine, W A', 'Anderson, P']","['Lo KM', 'Vivier E', 'Rochet N', 'Dehni G', 'Levine H', 'Haseltine WA', 'Anderson P']","['Division of Human Retrovirology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proviruses/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, IgG/physiology']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Dec 15;149(12):4101-8.,,,,,,,"['P30CAO6516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA53595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Greater efficacy has been observed with retinoids used in the prevention of cancer of the skin and oral cavity in high-risk patients. The potential for retinoids as chemopreventive agents is being further explored as selected retinoids are being targeted to specific malignancies, such as fenretinide for breast cancer chemoprevention. The effectiveness of tretinoin as a treatment for promyelocytic leukemia has raised enthusiasm for retinoids as cancer therapeutic agents.

Identity with type IV collagenase from HT1080 cells.,25228-32,"Neutrophils synthesize and store intracellularly a 92-kDa type IV collagenase (gelatinase), the primary structure of which is unknown. We designed a primer based on the highly conserved cysteine-switch region of metalloproteinases and employed the polymerase chain reaction to generate a probe of the human neutrophil gelatinase (HNG) gene. This probe was used to clone the cDNA encoding HNG by screening a chronic granulocytic leukemia cDNA library. In vitro translation of the cDNA-derived HNG mRNA yielded a major product of 78 kDa and smaller autolytically activated or degraded products, all of which were recognized by anti-HNG antibody. The HNG cDNA sequence is nearly identical to that encoding a 92-kDa gelatinase secreted by HT1080 cells. In addition, primer extension and S1 analysis reveal that the above two gelatinase transcripts have similar initiation sites. The HNG cDNA hybridized to a 2.8-kilobase mRNA from chronic granulocytic leukemia cells. HNG mRNA expression was absent from uninduced HL60 cells and from HL60 cells induced to granulocytic maturation with Me2SO. However, unlike other neutrophil secondary granule genes, HNG mRNA was detected in HL60 cells induced to monocytic maturation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. This suggests that the HNG gene may be subject to differential control pathways in two related but distinct hematopoietic lineages.","['Devarajan, P', 'Johnston, J J', 'Ginsberg, S S', 'Van Wart, H E', 'Berliner, N']","['Devarajan P', 'Johnston JJ', 'Ginsberg SS', 'Van Wart HE', 'Berliner N']","['Hematology Section, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Collagenases/*blood/genetics', 'DNA/blood/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Dec 15;267(35):25228-32.,,['S0021-9258(19)74029-0 [pii]'],,,,,"['DK-42347/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-27939/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-22297/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We have now obtained evidence that transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and glucocorticoids are negative regulators for HGF gene expression. When TGF-beta 1 or dexamethasone was added to cultures of MRC-5 human embryonic lung fibroblasts and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemic cells, the amount of HGF secreted into the culture medium was inhibited to 30-40% of that of control cultures by 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 and to 40-50% by 10(-6) M dexamethasone. The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone on HGF synthesis in MRC-5 cells was additive, thereby suggesting that TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone exert effects through distinct mechanisms. Hydrocortisone also inhibited HGF synthesis with the same potency as dexamethasone; however, testosterone, estriol, and beta-estradiol had no effect. The rate of HGF synthesis in MRC-5 cells, as measured by pulse labeling with [35S]methionine and subsequent immunoprecipitation, was suppressed to 30-40% of the control with 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1, and to 30-45% by 10(-6) M dexamethasone. HGF mRNA levels in MRC-5 cells and HL-60 cells were dose-dependently suppressed by TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone; 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 suppressed HGF mRNA levels to 32% and 35% of control culture, respectively, in MRC-5 cells and HL-60 cells, and 10(-6) M dexamethasone suppressed to 43% and 38%, respectively. Thus, TGF-beta 1 and glucocorticoids seem to inhibit HGF synthesis by suppressing the expression of the HGF gene. We propose that a negative regulation of HGF gene expression by TGF-beta 1 or glucocorticoids may be involved in physiological or pathological processes during tissue regeneration.","['Matsumoto, K', 'Tajima, H', 'Okazaki, H', 'Nakamura, T']","['Matsumoto K', 'Tajima H', 'Okazaki H', 'Nakamura T']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'FB33469R8E (Estriol)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Estriol/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lung', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Testosterone/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Dec 15;267(35):24917-20.,,['S0021-9258(19)73982-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These antibodies were highly specific in ELISA using synthetic peptides as an antigen. Subsequently, we examined the neutralizing activity expressed by the inhibition of virion-induced syncytium formation by region specific antibodies. Twelve of 16 antibodies derived from the env protein were able to inhibit syncytium formation induced by co-cultivation of 8C cells with HTLV-I antigen-positive T cells. The antibodies derived from the p19 gag protein and the seronegative plasma used as the control showed no significant activity.

The bcl-3 protein is able to inhibit the DNA binding and trans-activation of authentic NF-kappa B heterodimers p50-p65 and p49-p65, as well as p50 and p49 homodimers. The bcl-3 protein does not inhibit either the DNA-binding activity of the Rel protein or its ability to trans-activate genes linked to the kappa B site. A human 37-kD protein (I kappa B alpha), identified previously as a member of the I kappa B family, is also unable to inhibit DNA-binding activity of the Rel protein. However, unlike bcl-3, the 37-kD (I kappa B alpha) protein has no effect on the DNA-binding activity of p50 or p49 homodimers. Two dimensional phosphotryptic peptide maps of the human bcl-3 and the human 37-kD (I kappa B alpha) proteins reveal that the phosphopeptides from the 37-kD (I kappa B alpha) protein are nested within the bcl-3 protein. Furthermore, bcl-3 antisera immunoprecipitates an in vitro-radiolabeled 37-kD (I kappa B alpha) protein. Proteins of 56 and 38 kD can be identified in HeLa cells stimulated with PMA and immunoprecipitated with bcl-3 antisera. Comparison of tryptic peptide maps of the bcl-3 protein synthesized in vitro, and p56 and p38 from HeLa cells, shows that they are all structurally related. Removal of the amino-terminal sequences of the bcl-3 protein generates a protein that inhibits the DNA binding of the p50-p65 heterodimer but, like the 37-kD (I kappa B alpha) protein, is no longer able to inhibit the binding of the p50 and p49 homodimers with kappa B DNA. We propose that the bcl-3 and 37-kD (I kappa B alpha) proteins are related and are members of the I kappa B family.","['Kerr, L D', 'Duckett, C S', 'Wamsley, P', 'Zhang, Q', 'Chiao, P', 'Nabel, G', 'McKeithan, T W', 'Baeuerle, P A', 'Verma, I M']","['Kerr LD', 'Duckett CS', 'Wamsley P', 'Zhang Q', 'Chiao P', 'Nabel G', 'McKeithan TW', 'Baeuerle PA', 'Verma IM']","['Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego, California 92186.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'DNA', 'Drosophila', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 1992 Dec;6(12A):2352-63. doi: 10.1101/gad.6.12a.2352.,,['10.1101/gad.6.12a.2352 [doi]'],,['bcl-3'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a filter-binding assay, we observed that the addition of various doses of [methyl-3H]thymidine (0.2 and 2 microCi/ml) or [2-14C]thymidine (0.02 and 0.2 microCi/ml) in the culture medium for 2 days, a standard method for cell-labeling, induces DNA fragmentation in HL-60 human promyelocytic cells. This effect was dose- and time-dependent and the DNA fragments were not protein-linked since the levels of DNA fragmentation were identical in the presence and in the absence of proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml). Radiolabeled thymidine-induced DNA fragmentation was associated with an inhibition of cell growth, but cells remained able to exclude trypan blue, suggesting that plasma membrane integrity was conserved, except at very high doses of [methyl-3H]thymidine (2 microCi/ml). By agarose-gel electrophoresis, the DNA-fragmentation was demonstrated to be internucleosomal with a typical ladder pattern. Addition of unlabeled thymidine to the culture medium prevented DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that radiolabeled thymidine incorporation in DNA was directly responsible for DNA fragmentation. We conclude that radiolabeling of DNA using thymidine incorporation can induce DNA fragmentation in some cell lines such as HL-60.

Atypical antigenic features were determined by double color flow cytometry and included coexpression of lymphoid and myeloid related antigens, unphysiological coexpression of immature and mature antigens, and lack of an antigen that is normally expressed during maturation. Atypical immunophenotypes were detected in 35 of 68 patients with AML (51.5%) and 15 of 24 patients with ALL (62.5%). When 12 patients with leukemia-associated markers were again analyzed at relapse, the relevant antigen combinations were retained in 11 of them. The sensitivity of this two color flow cytometric assay as determined in dilution experiments was 1 in 10(3) to 10(4) cells. Follow-up studies of bone marrow samples revealed that, after induction chemotherapy cells with leukemia-associated markers were detectable in several patients at a frequency of 0.5 to 4%, but only patients in whom the cells with atypical antigens never disappeared suffered from relapse. In contrast, patients who became negative for the atypical cells remained in complete remission (median remission duration after the first negative bone marrow assessment by flow cytometry 52 weeks, range 20-102). We conclude that atypical antigen combinations, which are present in a meaningful number of acute leukemias, are a valuable means of monitoring acute leukemia patients during follow-up. This flow cytometric approach can complement other strategies to get a more accurate definition of remission in acute leukemia.","['Drach, J', 'Drach, D', 'Glassl, H', 'Gattringer, C', 'Huber, H']","['Drach J', 'Drach D', 'Glassl H', 'Gattringer C', 'Huber H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Child', '*Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1992;13(8):893-901. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990130813.,,['10.1002/cyto.990130813 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs have been shown to intercalate between the strands of DNA. In the present study, we show that the amount of ANT intercalated into DNA can be determined by measuring the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Hoechst 33342 (H33342) and ANT bound to DNA. The transfer efficiency was found to depend on the amount of disposable ANT but was independent of the amount of H33342 bound to DNA over a wide range of H33342 concentrations. The method was adapted for flow cytometric measurement of FRET in whole living cells and was used to evaluate the degree of intercalation of daunorubicin (DAU) and idarubicine (IDA) into DAU-sensitive and DAU-resistant leukemic cell lines. ANT intercalation into DNA was affected by factors which modify the intracytoplasmic concentration of ANT, and it was shown that the action of ANT and the resistance to ANT could not be attributed solely to the intercalative effect of the drugs. The method has advantages over previously described methods and represents a useful complementary tool in studies on the mode of action of ANT and the mechanisms of chemoresistance.","['Belloc, F', 'Lacombe, F', 'Dumain, P', 'Lopez, F', 'Bernard, P', 'Boisseau, M R', 'Reifers, J']","['Belloc F', 'Lacombe F', 'Dumain P', 'Lopez F', 'Bernard P', 'Boisseau MR', 'Reifers J']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Haut Leveque, Pessac, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['*Benzimidazoles/chemistry', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Energy Transfer', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1992;13(8):880-5. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990130811.,,['10.1002/cyto.990130811 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the pH-step alkaline elution procedure, the smallest fragments of nDNA elute at pH 11. Anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of nDNA obtained by 1 h elution at pH 11.0 of lysed HL-60 cells revealed a preponderance of nDNA fragments ranging from 0.5 to 40 kb in control ([3H]-dThd-labeled) cells. Exposure of cells to ara-C (0.8-1 microM) resulted in a loss of the preponderance of radiolabel in fragments of 0.5-40 kb along with redistribution of the radiolabel (from [3H]-dThd or [3H]-ara-C) into smaller nDNA fragments (predominantly < 100 bases in length) as determined by HPLC. We used the ability of pH-step alkaline elution to provide these small nDNA fragments produced by ara-C to investigate the paradoxical behavior of ara-C as a chain terminator in cell-free DNA synthetic systems while being incorporated into an internucleotide position in intact cells. Following the digestion of purified nDNA with micrococcal nuclease and spleen phosphodiesterase II, the proportion of radiolabel in 3'-dNMP (indicating an internucleotide position) or free nucleoside (indicating a chain terminus position) was determined by reverse-phase HPLC. In digests of prelabeled genomic DNA, as expected, > 90% of the radiolabel from [14C]-dThd or [3H]-ara-C was found to exist in an internucleotide position (as determined by co-chromatography with authentic 3'-dTMP or 3'-ara-CMP). In contrast, digests of nDNA that eluted at pH 11.0 revealed a significantly higher proportion of radiolabel in the chain terminus position (29%-35%) when the nDNA was obtained from cells exposed to 1 microM [3H]-ara-C as compared with cells exposed to [3H]-dThd or [3H]-dCyd alone (< 10%). These data obtained from pH-step alkaline elution of intact cells suggest that by causing the inhibition of chain elongation while failing to inhibit the formation of new nDNA replication intermediates, ara-C exposure leads to the production of very small nDNA fragments. This relative chain-terminating effect of ara-C is most apparent in the small nDNA replication fragments that elute at pH 11.0.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ross, D D', 'Cuddy, D P', 'Cohen, N', 'Hensley, D R']","['Ross DD', 'Cuddy DP', 'Cohen N', 'Hensley DR']","['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)']",IM,"['Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;31(1):61-70. doi: 10.1007/BF00695996.,,['10.1007/BF00695996 [doi]'],,,,,['R0-1-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon is termed the inoculum effect. Since VCR and DXR are less active in an acidic environment, we questioned whether the inoculum effects could have resulted from acidification of the medium that may have developed due to the high cell density. However, measurements of the cytotoxic activity of these agents in a pH-controlled medium revealed only a minor correction of the inoculum effects. Second, we wondered whether the inoculum effects that occurred at the high cell density might have been attributable to insufficient amounts of drugs to bind all the binding sites of the cells. To test this hypothesis, we used drug-resistant sublines, which required higher VCR or DXR concentrations for cell killing than did the parent cell line. When higher drug concentrations were used, the dose-response curves generated for low- and high-density cell populations became closer and overlapped each other, resulting in virtual disappearance of the inoculum effects. Measurements of cellular drug levels revealed that at a high cell density, cells accumulated much smaller amounts of both VCR and DXR in parallel with the positive inoculum effect. In contrast, when high concentrations of the drugs were used in drug-resistant cells, differences in the cellular drug contents between low and high cell densities became narrow. Cisplatin (DDP) belongs to a group of drugs that do not produce inoculum effects, and DDP's cytotoxic effects were not influenced by the pH-controlled medium or by the use of drug-resistant cell lines. These observations indicate that the inoculum effects are the result of the unavailability of VCR or DXR molecules to all cellular binding sites when cells at high densities are exposed to drugs. The drug concentration relative to cell density was apparently the major determinant for the inoculum effects seen in VCR- or DXR-induced cell killing.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Takemura, Y', 'Ohnuma, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Ohnuma T']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Culture Media)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Biological Availability', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Vincristine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;31(1):6-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00695987.,,['10.1007/BF00695987 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potentiation of ara-C metabolism is due in part to an indirect effect of F-ara-A triphosphate (F-ara-ATP)-mediated reduction in deoxynucleotide pools and consequent activation of deoxycytidine kinase. Because the levels of deoxynucleotide pools and the activity of deoxycytidine kinase are cell cycle-specific, we investigated the effect of cell cycle phases on the accumulation of ara-CTP and the influence of F-ara-A pretreatment on such accumulation. Exponentially growing K562 cells were fractionated into G1, S, and G2+M phase-enriched subpopulations (each enriched by > 60%) by centrifugal elutriation. The rate of ara-CTP accumulation was 22, 25, and 14 microM/h and the rate of F-ara-ATP accumulation was 38, 47, and 33 microM/h in the G1, S, and G2+M subpopulations, respectively. The rate of elimination of arabinosyl triphosphates was similar among the different phases of the cell cycle.

These results suggest that a combination of F-ara-A and ara-C may effectively potentiate ara-CTP accumulation in all phases of the cell cycle.

The chemicals were administered in the drinking water at doses that approximated those used in previously conducted 2-year carcinogenesis studies. Simultaneous with dose administration, half of a group of young, healthy, syngeneic rats were given subcutaneous transplants of mononuclear cells derived from spleens of leukemic donors. Variables used to quantitate tumor progression included body weight, spleen weight, white blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) counts, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, and platelet counts. Iodinated glycerol at 1.25 or 2.5 mg/ml caused a greater increase in leukocytosis in dosed transplant recipients in comparison to that experienced by undosed recipients: trichlorfon at 2.5 or 5.0 mg/ml enhanced splenomegaly and induced greater reductions in RBC parameters in dosed recipients in comparison to that experienced by undosed recipients. Acetaminophen at 3.0 and 6.0 mg/ml resulted in insignificant but dose-related increases in spleen weight and leukocytosis only in the female rat transplant recipients, as was observed in 2-year studies. Based on results from the short-term leukemia transplant model, data from 2-year carcinogenicity studies, and structure-activity considerations, exposure to iodinated glycerol and trichlorfon was more strongly associated with the expression of leukemia than exposure to acetaminophen. The potential carcinogenicity of each of these chemicals should be taken into consideration when calculating estimates of risk and decisions for their use.","['Dieter, M P', 'Maronpot, R R', 'Jameson, C W', 'Ward, S M']","['Dieter MP', 'Maronpot RR', 'Jameson CW', 'Ward SM']","['National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,"['0 (Expectorants)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', '8C0LU36AR9 (iodinated glycerol)', 'DBF2DG4G2K (Trichlorfon)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Expectorants/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Glycerol/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Trichlorfon/*toxicity']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1992;16(3):173-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radicicol reduced the intracellular level of autophosphorylation of p60v-src as well as the level of other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro kinase assay revealed that radicicol effectively inhibited not only autophosphorylation but also transphosphorylation activities of purified p60v-src with a concentration producing 50% inhibition of 0.1 microgram/ml. However, radicicol showed no inhibitory effect on protein kinase C or protein kinase A.

Further, once developed, thermotolerance decays at a faster rate than that normally observed in cells of nonhemopoietic origin. Thermotolerance induction and maintenance correlates with reduced levels of expression of various M(r) 70,000 heat shock proteins (HSP-70) mRNAs after heat shock. We have now compared the accumulation of HSP-70 proteins in heat-shocked human leukemic cells KG-1, HL-60, and K562 to that in Ht1080, a colon carcinoma cell line. We have found reduced accumulation of HSP-70 proteins in all leukemic cells. The rate of decay of HSP-70A mRNA, measured following heat shock by using actinomycin D treatment to inhibit further RNA synthesis, was more rapid in KG-1 and HL-60 cells compared to Ht1080 cells. The half-life of HSP-70A mRNA was 2 h in KG-1 and HL-60 cells while in Ht1080 cells it was > 7 h. HSP-70A mRNA is known to decay with a half-life of 2 h in unheated cells; this is increased to > 7 h following heat shock. We therefore postulate that leukemic cells lack the mechanism to stabilize HSP-70A mRNA after heat shock. One postulated mechanism for HSP-70 mRNA decay rate is known to be due to the nucleotide sequences at the 3'-untranslated region. We examined the 3'-untranslated region in leukemic cells. No sequence variations, however, were observed at either the genomic or the complementary DNA levels between leukemic or nonleukemic tumor cells. Heat shock factor activation and binding by gel retardation assays showed that KG-1 and HL-60 cells had a reduced heat shock factor binding to the heat shock element when compared to K562 and Ht1080 cells. Furthermore, HSF-1 mRNA was found to be expressed at relatively lower levels in HL-60 cells when compared to Ht1080 or KG-1 cells. In conclusion, reduced HSP synthesis and accumulation of leukemic cells after heat shock correlates with the reduction in heat shock factor-heat shock element binding and a faster HSP-70A mRNA decay rate that is observed in these cells.","['Mivechi, N F', 'Ouyang, H', 'Hahn, G M']","['Mivechi NF', 'Ouyang H', 'Hahn GM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Dec 15;52(24):6815-22.,,,,,,,"['CA-54093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 44665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

M195 is a murine immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a), anti-CD33 mAb, specifically reactive with acute myelogenous leukemia cells, that is active as an antileukemia agent in humans. The new mAb constructs maintained specificity and biological function, including rapid internalization after binding to the cell surface, which has been important for delivery of therapeutic isotopes in patients. Although previously reported complementarity-determining region-grafted mAbs had reduced avidities, the HuG1 and HuG3 M195 showed up to an 8.6- and 4-fold higher binding avidity, respectively, than the original murine mAb. All constructs were effective at mediating rabbit complement-mediated cytotoxicity against HL60 targets. Fibroblasts transfected with CD33 genes and expressing high levels of CD33 antigen were also lysed in the presence of human complement, but HL60 cells or fibroblasts with lower CD33 levels were not killed. Thus, the inability of M195 and constructs to kill HL60 targets with human complement is due to the much lower antigen density on HL60 cells compared to CD33+ fibroblasts. Unlike the murine M195, the chimeric and humanized M195 demonstrated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as effectors. Because the chimeric and humanized M195 have improved avidities as compared to the original M195 and have, in addition, the potential to avoid human anti-mouse antibody responses and to recruit human effector functions, these new constructs may be useful therapeutically, either alone or conjugated to toxins or isotopes, in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Caron, P C', 'Co, M S', 'Bull, M K', 'Avdalovic, N M', 'Queen, C', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Caron PC', 'Co MS', 'Bull MK', 'Avdalovic NM', 'Queen C', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis/*immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Dec 15;52(24):6761-7.,,,,,,,['R01CA55349-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Event-free survival (EFS) and survival studies showed that the outcome of patients was determined only by treatment and karyotype. Eleven patients have survived, nine in first remission (6 years 5 months to 15 years 2 months), and two are in second remission (3 years 8 months and 8 years 2 months). All ploidy groups are represented in these patients. Late relapses can occur in the hyperdiploid > 50 group, thus accounting for shorter EFS than expected, but because of the unusually long second remission of one patient, the rate of surviving patients was higher for this ploidy group than for all other ploidy groups together. Conversely, patients with only numerical abnormalities (no matter which ploidy group they belonged to), had a better outcome than did patients with structural changes or normal karyotypes and no discrepancy between EFS and survival curves was observed in this chromosomal group. Thus, our results suggest that numerical changes only should be considered an indicator of low risk factor, but our results, based on partially banded karyotypes, need to be verified by a current method and therapy.","['Dastugue, N', 'Robert, A', 'Payen, C', 'Clement, D', 'Kessous, A', 'Demur, C', 'Rubie, H', 'Plaisancie, H', 'Bourrouillou, G', 'Colombies, P']","['Dastugue N', 'Robert A', 'Payen C', 'Clement D', 'Kessous A', 'Demur C', 'Rubie H', 'Plaisancie H', 'Bourrouillou G', 'Colombies P']","[""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie et de Genetique, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1992 Nov;64(1):49-55. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(92)90322-y.,,"['0165-4608(92)90322-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(92)90322-y [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review.,"721-3, 727-8","It would require a detailed knowledge of virology, molecular biology, epidemiology, clinical medicine and politics, to appropriately compare and contrast the hypotheses on the causes of AIDS. The purpose of this review was not to do that, but to inform colleagues that alternative etiologies for AIDS have been considered. No doubt, this healthy questioning will continue until it has been demonstrated--via controlled studies of high-risk groups (both HIV positive and negative), matched for all other characteristics--that only those individuals with HIV positivity actually develop AIDS. It cannot be denied that a common theme to the hypotheses is the presence of high-risk activities. This has been used against the risk-AIDS hypothesis. How, for example, could it explain babies born with immunodeficiencies, K. Bergalis contacting AIDS from her dentist, the British nurse who died of AIDS after contracting HIV from her husband, or AIDS in the wives of hemophiliacs? It may be that these people died of specific diseases (leukemia, pneumonia, infections), which 20 years ago would have been diagnosed as such. Now, because these individuals are found to be HIV positive, they are viewed as AIDS patients. Alternatively, they may not have been asked about their nutritional status, use of psychoactive drugs, and immunosuppressive sexual practices. Additionally, it is possible that by the time AIDS was diagnosed they may have already received numerous antibiotic (immunosuppressive) drug treatments.

For the purpose of evaluating the release behavior of 5FU, the hydrolysis of the urethane or urea bond in the obtained conjugate of PEG-end capped with 5FU was investigated in vitro at 37 degrees C in aqueous solution media. The survival effect for the conjugate was assessed in vivo against p388 lymphocytic leukemia in female CDF1 mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) transplantation/i.p. injection. The effects of a hydrophobic hexamethylene spacer group, the end group and the number n of ethylene oxide (EO) units in PEG on the release behavior of 5FU and the survival effect were investigated. The release rate of 5FU from the 5FU-terminated PEG conjugates via urethane or urea bond was very fast. However, it became slow with increasing n of EO units in PEG and was depressed by the introduction of hydrophobic spacer group. The 5FU-terminated PEG conjugates obtained exhibited significant survival effects against p388 leukemia mice i.p./i.p. Especially, the methoxy PEG (n = 113)/urethane/hexamethylene/urea/5FU conjugate showed the strongest survival effect among the synthesized 5FU-capped PEG conjugates via urethane or urea bond compared to free 5FU against p388 leukemia mice.

All cases were routinely recorded in the Hospital Information System, which has an active annual follow-up. Of all patients, 57% remained relapse free. According to the kinds of treatment they received, the following major categories were established: radiotherapy only (28.2%), chemotherapy only (20.1%), only initial combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy (34.2%), all other combinations of radio- and chemotherapy (15.4%), or not registered (2.1%). Twenty-seven second cancers were observed; six leukemias, five non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 16 solid tumors. Of all solid tumors only nine occurred in relapse-free patients. The overall relative risk of second cancers increased with the duration of follow-up. Using general population incidence rates to calculate expected numbers, the risk for developing leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumors was increased 36-fold, 31-fold, and 2.4-fold, respectively. The cumulative risk of developing a second cancer 10 years after diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease was 7% for both the radiotherapy-only and the initial combination of radio- and chemotherapy group. It was 16% and 17% for the chemotherapy-only and the other combinations of radio- and chemotherapy group, respectively. Multivariate analysis (using the Cox regression model) show an increased risk of second cancers (RR = 0.7) when a relapse of Hodgkin's disease resulting in increasing cumulative therapy occurred. Age at diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease was an important determinant for the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumors. Cumulative chemotherapy intensity was an important factor in increasing leukemic risk in a dose-response fashion. Apart from this, the stage of Hodgkin's disease, although closely related to the kind of therapy, seemed to have an independent effect on leukemic risk.","['Sont, J K', 'van Stiphout, W A', 'Noordijk, E M', 'Molenaar, J', 'Zwetsloot-Schonk, J H', 'Willemze, R', 'Vandenbroucke, J P']","['Sont JK', 'van Stiphout WA', 'Noordijk EM', 'Molenaar J', 'Zwetsloot-Schonk JH', 'Willemze R', 'Vandenbroucke JP']","['Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Netherlands', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1992 Nov;65(5):213-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01703947.,,['10.1007/BF01703947 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective and long-lived clinical responses have been documented in a proportion of cases, particularly renal cell carcinoma, melanoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. Though encouraging, the clinical use of IL2 has so far been limited by toxicity, as well as by the heterogeneous and unpredictable responses and by the lack of specific anti-tumour effect. These considerations have led to the belief that more sophisticated technologies aimed at introducing the IL2 gene into the neoplastic cells may potentially overcome some of the limitations coupled to the in vivo infusion of high doses of IL2. The data accumulated in animal models and, more recently, also with human tumour cells indicate that the IL2 gene may be successfully inserted into neoplastic cells. The constitutive secretion of IL2 by the tumour cells leads to a reduced or abrogated tumorigenicity in several different tumour models. The evidence that in some experimental tumours the transduction of the IL2 gene into the neoplastic cells may elicit a specific cytotoxic response and confer anti-tumour memory, suggests that vaccination protocols based on this innovative strategy may represent a potential new tool in the management of cancer patients.","['Foa, R', 'Guarini, A', 'Gansbacher, B']","['Foa R', 'Guarini A', 'Gansbacher B']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', '*Transfection']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1992 Dec;66(6):992-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1992.400.,,['10.1038/bjc.1992.400 [doi]'],,,70,PMC1978061,,,,,,,,,,,

ADF/thioredoxin production is enhanced in T cells transformed by HTLV-I. We have examined the effect of HIV-1 infection on ADF/TRX expression using specific antibody against ADF/TRX. Lymph nodes from 5 AIDS and 1 AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients were examined. As a control, 8 HIV noninfected lymph nodes, including 3 cases with hyperplasia, were also examined. Immunohistopathological studies using normal HIV noninfected lymph nodes showed that ADF/TRX high-producer (ADFh) cells were macrophages and cells with dendritic morphology in the paracortical area. Abundant ADFh cells were observed in HIV noninfected hyperplastic lymph nodes. The number of ADFh cells was low in hyperplastic lymph nodes from an ARC patient. All of the lymph nodes of 5 AIDS cases were atrophic and the number of ADFh cells were extremely low. To verify these histochemical studies, we examined the effect of in vitro HIV infection on ADF/TRX expression in HTLV-I (+) T-cell lines. Western blot analysis showed that a reduction of ADF/TRX in HIV-1-infected SKT-1B and MT-2 cells, and the reduction inversely correlated with p24 antigen level. On the basis of the above in vivo and in vitro findings, we imply that the levels of ADF/TRX were down-regulated by HIV-1 infection and that the down-regulation may play a role for pathophysiology of HIV-infected individuals.","['Masutani, H', 'Naito, M', 'Takahashi, K', 'Hattori, T', 'Koito, A', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Go, T', 'Nakamura, H', 'Fujii, S', 'Yoshida, Y']","['Masutani H', 'Naito M', 'Takahashi K', 'Hattori T', 'Koito A', 'Takatsuki K', 'Go T', 'Nakamura H', 'Fujii S', 'Yoshida Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Biological Responses, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",IM,"['AIDS-Related Complex/metabolism', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*metabolism/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', '*Cytokines', 'HIV Infections/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/*metabolism']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1992 Sep;8(9):1707-15. doi: 10.1089/aid.1992.8.1707.,,['10.1089/aid.1992.8.1707 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined another human retrovirus, HTLV-1, to determine whether DC were infected and caused any changes in T-cell function. Patients infected with HTLV-1 who have tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) show high 'spontaneous' lymphocyte proliferation. We studied the basis for this by analyzing the interactions in vitro between lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells and compared cells taken from HTLV-1-positive TSP patients with those taken from HTLV-1-positive healthy carriers and HTLV-1-negative family members. In HTLV-1-positive individuals, 0.4-5.1% of the DC were infected with HTLV-1 as determined by in situ hybridisation. In TSP patients, depletion of DC and purification of T cells abolished 'spontaneous' lymphocyte proliferation. Reinstating the DC, but not B cells or macrophages, restored proliferation, an effect that was blocked by antibodies either to class II major histocompatibility antigens or to HTLV-1 itself. Thus, presentation of HTLV-1 antigens by infected DC to autologous T cells could result in the abnormal T-cell proliferation and cause the inflammatory reaction leading to tissue damage in TSP. We also speculate that persistent infection of DC with HTLV-1 and consequent continuous stimulation of T cells might be instrumental in the development of HTLV-1-mediated T-cell leukemia.","['Macatonia, S E', 'Cruickshank, J K', 'Rudge, P', 'Knight, S C']","['Macatonia SE', 'Cruickshank JK', 'Rudge P', 'Knight SC']","['MRC Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, Middlesex, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,,IM,"['Dendritic Cells/immunology/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology/microbiology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1992 Sep;8(9):1699-706. doi: 10.1089/aid.1992.8.1699.,,['10.1089/aid.1992.8.1699 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The involvement of platelets in this disease are reported here. The RLV-A induced a severe thrombocytopenia (25 percent of control level) at the terminal stage of disease. This thrombocytopenia was not associated with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy since the prothrombin times were always within normal limits. The partial thromboplastin time was elevated in the terminal stages of disease and was found to be associated with factor deficiencies, possibly owing to the presence of anti-factor antibodies, in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, especially factor VIII. Further, splenectomy did not abolish the thrombocytopenia, since splenectomized, virally infected animals also developed severe thrombocytopenia (29 percent of control levels). The ensuing splenomegaly during progression of disease was not the cause of the thrombocytopenia. A physiological response to the severe thrombocytopenia was the production of larger size platelets. At terminal stages of the disease, platelet volume increased to 4.2 mu 3 (normal is 3.0 mu 3). An increase in platelet volume was also observed in splenectomized, virally infected animals.

Remarkably similar profiles were noted for the twins on tests of nonverbal intelligence, visual memory, visual attention, psychomotor speed, and mental flexibility. All performances were in the average to high average range. Significant differences were found on tasks measuring verbal abstract reasoning skills. These differences were postulated to result from prophylactic treatment, leukemia itself, or disruption in normal psychosocial development. As in previous studies, problems with auditory attention were found. However, both children displayed attentional difficulties regardless of treatment status. Emotional assessment indicated that both twins were experiencing a clinically significant level of anxiety that was postulated to play a role in reduced attention skills. Findings argue for the continued need for monitoring the neuropsychological functioning of children given prophylactic treatment and demonstrate the importance of measuring emotional factors in assessment with these children.","['Williams, J', 'Berry, D H', 'Caldwell, D', 'Zolten, A J', 'Spence, G T']","['Williams J', 'Berry DH', 'Caldwell D', 'Zolten AJ', 'Spence GT']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72202.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Affective Symptoms/physiopathology', 'Attention/physiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Language Tests', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Memory/physiology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/*psychology', 'Psychomotor Performance/physiology', 'Twins, Monozygotic/*psychology', 'Verbal Learning/physiology', 'Wechsler Scales']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1992 Nov;14(4):289-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suspected clusters of childhood leukemia in the neighborhoods of two British nuclear reprocessing facilities led Leo Kinlen to postulate that large-scale immigration into areas that had previously been remote and isolated offers opportunities for spread of viral infections to which most urban populations become immune at a very early age: leukemia may be a rare manifestation of infection by one or more of such viruses. He and his group have presented evidence in support of this hypothesis. Lack of increase in childhood leukemia in the contexts of the massive evacuation of mothers and children from British cities during the Second World War, and of the considerable immigration into previously isolated islands of Greece during the last several decades, indicates that some large movements of children have occurred without providing the circumstances postulated by Kinlen. The marked inverse association of leukemia risk with birth order, noted almost 30 years ago, remains unexplained and deserves to be recalled when considering the possibility of viral involvement in the etiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia of children.","['MacMahon, B']",['MacMahon B'],"['Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,['0 (Radioactive Waste)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Birth Order', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Radioactive Waste', 'Risk Factors', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Virus Diseases/*complications']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1992 Oct 15;136(8):916-24. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116564.,,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116564 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dye-sensitized photoinactivation of leukemia cells was enhanced when cells were stored at 4 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C between irradiation periods, most likely in part because the cells were unable to repair sublethal photodynamic damages at the lower temperature.

Phosphorothioate analogs penetrated and accumulated intact in cells in contrast to unmodified oligomers, which showed a high instability in cell culture medium. A slow decrease of intracellular concentration of undegraded phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides was observed after cell treatment and could be predominantly explained by a significant efflux transport. Using laser-assisted confocal microscopy we have observed that fluorescein 5-end-labeled phosphorothioate derivatives predominantly distributed in intracytoplasmic endocytic vesicles following cell treatment. The end-capped version of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides exhibited greater cellular uptake than fully modified analogues while exhibiting similar biological stability. Liposome encapsulation made possible oligomer protection in serum-containing medium and substantially improved cellular accumulation. Furthermore, the efflux rate of oligomer initially introduced within liposomes is 2-fold lower than that observed in cells which have been incubated with free oligonucleotides. Liposomal preparations of oligodeoxynucleotides facilitate release from endocytic vesicles, and thus, cytoplasmic and nuclear localization are observed following cell treatment. Furthermore, intracellular distribution studies demonstrate that intracellular transport of unmodified oligomers is effectively achieved using the liposomal carrier.","['Thierry, A R', 'Dritschilo, A']","['Thierry AR', 'Dritschilo A']","['Department of Radiation Medicine, Vincent T.

Molecular analysis of these cases has permitted recognition that some cases present a breakpoint in the bcr region of chromosome 22, that is, the alteration constituting the substrate of the Ph chromosome. To date, the number of patients analyzed to this regard is low. METHODS: Six patients with Ph negative CML who constituted part of a series of 96 patients diagnosed with CML over a period of 6 years were studied. Analysis of the BCR gene in the DNA of the leuko-concentrate of peripheral blood was carried out with the Southern Blot technique, using the 3' and 5' probes and Transprobe and the restriction enzymes Bgl II, Eco RI, Hind III and Bam HI. The principal clinical-hematological characteristics of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Breakpoints were observed in the bcr region of chromosome 22 in 3 of the 6 patients, all of whom presented typical CML clinical-hematological features. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the patients with Philadelphia negative (Ph-) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have a breakpoint in the bcr region of chromosome 22, a similar molecular pattern to the Ph positive CML and their clinical-hematological profile is indistinguishable from those with CML.","['Cervantes, F', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Pujades, A', 'Bosch, F', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Cervantes F', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Pujades A', 'Bosch F', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Montserrat E', 'Rozman C']","['Escuela de Hematologia Farreras-Valenti, Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, y Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Universidad de Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogenes/*genetics']",1992/09/19 00:00,1992/09/19 00:01,['1992/09/19 00:00'],"['1992/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1992 Sep 19;99(8):286-8.,Analisis molecular en la leucemia mieloide cronica cromosoma Filadelfia negativa: estudio de seis casos.,,,['bcr'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study aims at adding to this approach by detecting differences in the intracellular metabolism of AraC 5'-triphosphate (AraCTP) between leukemic and normal mononuclear blood cells. Measurements of intracellular AraCTP levels were complemented by determinations of plasma AraC and AraU concentrations and were performed in 32 patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing combination therapy including either conventional (100 mg/m2 daily) or high-dose (1.0 or 3.0 g/m2 twice daily) AraC. Plasma AraC concentration showed a linear relationship to the applied AraC dose but did not correlate with intracellular AraCTP levels. During conventional-dose AraC therapy little interpatient variation was observed in AraCTP retention times in leukemic blasts from 5 patients with t1/2 values ranging from 1.70 to 2.50 h (median 2.14 h). In all cases AraCTP levels declined rapidly after the end of the AraC infusion. Substantial differences in AraCTP retention times were revealed, however, during 3 h infusions of either 1.0 or 3.0 g/m2 AraC in leukemic blasts from 10 patients with t1/2 values between 1.60 to 7.63 h (median 2.42 h). In addition, AraCTP levels declined in only one patient by > 10% within the first hour after the end of therapy and remained constant or even increased up to 1.5-fold in a post-treatment period of 1 to 2.5 h in the other nine cases. In contrast, AraCTP retention times were relatively uniform in normal mononuclear blood cells from 11 patients with t1/2 values of 3.34 to 5.29 h (median 3.85 h). More importantly, AraCTP levels dropped by > 10% within the first hour after the end of the high-dose AraC infusion in eight of 11 cases. A post-therapeutic increase > 10% was not observed in any patient. Similar findings emerged after in vitro exposure of normal bone marrow cells from six healthy volunteers to 20 mumol/l AraC for 3 h revealing a > 10% decrease of intracellular AraCTP within the first post-treatment hour in all cases with AraCTP retention times of 2.29 to 8.63 h (median 3.20 h). These differences in AraCTP pharmacokinetics between leukemic and normal blood cells may provide the basis for a modified timing of AraC administration with the aim of selectively maintaining cytotoxic AraCTP levels in leukemic blasts while allowing an intermittent drop of AraCTP levels in normal cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hiddemann, W', 'Schleyer, E', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Zuhlsdorf, M', 'Rolf, C', 'Reuter, C', 'Kewer, U', 'Uhrmeister, C', 'Wormann, B', 'Buchner, T']","['Hiddemann W', 'Schleyer E', 'Unterhalt M', 'Zuhlsdorf M', 'Rolf C', 'Reuter C', 'Kewer U', 'Uhrmeister C', 'Wormann B', 'Buchner T']","['Department of Hematology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/analysis/*metabolism', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Dec;6(12):1273-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full-length CD4 mRNA was detected in 12 out of 15 (80%) cases, and AML cells positive for CD4 mRNA expression also expressed the CD4 antigen. Since the CD4 molecule expressed by T cells is associated with p56lck, a member of the src family of intracellular tyrosine kinases, we investigated whether the CD4 molecule expressed by myeloid blasts is also associated with a tyrosine kinase activity. In vitro kinase assays performed on anti-CD4 immunoprecipitates from lysates of myeloid leukemia cells from four CD4+ cases were negative for the presence of a tyrosine kinase activity. This finding was not due to the lack of expression of members of the src family since we were able to detect at least p60src and p59fyn in myeloid leukemia cells. According to our results, the CD4 molecule seems to belong to the phenotypic repertoire of most AML, irrespective of their FAB subtypes. However, in myeloid blasts this molecule is not associated with a tyrosine kinase activity as it occurs in T lymphocytes.","['Vinante, F', 'Pizzolo, G', 'Rigo, A', 'Vincenzi, C', 'Sorio, C', 'Cassatella, M', 'Berton, G']","['Vinante F', 'Pizzolo G', 'Rigo A', 'Vincenzi C', 'Sorio C', 'Cassatella M', 'Berton G']","['Department of Hematology, Verona University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/enzymology/*immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Dec;6(12):1257-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither patient with del(16)(q22) had typical M4Eo morphology at diagnosis; CR was achieved in one and one had resistant leukaemia. Patients with other abnormalities of 16q had blasts of diverse morphology and, although morphologically abnormal eosinophils were seen in three patients, this was not as marked as in the patients with inv(16). CR was achieved in two of the four patients with other abnormalities of 16q but duration of remission was short in both cases.

The risk of early fatal hemorrhage is increased when high peripheral-blood blast count and severe DIC accompanied by visceral hemorrhage are present at diagnosis. Progressive cytolysis induced by daily increased doses of chemotherapy, or differentiation all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy have been proposed for initial control of DIC, but both are dangerous in hyperleukocytic APL patients. We report our results obtained in three high-risk APL patients treated with a combination of conventional chemotherapy and ATRA. All patients had documented hyperleukocytic APL [M3 or M3-variant subtype, (15, 17) translocation] with DIC, and all had critical clinical course before treatment. Patient 1 presented with cerebral hemorrhage, patients 2 and 3 had acute respiratory failure probably due to pulmonary leukemic infiltration and pulmonary hemorrhage. In order to minimize the severity of DIC during chemotherapy-induced acute cytolysis, ATRA (45 mg/m2 per day) was started on the first or second day of chemotherapy and withdrawn when complete remission (CR) was achieved. Despite adverse clinical features, CR was obtained in these three high-risk patients. Patient 1 showed no increase of cerebral bleeding during therapy. Patients 2 and 3 required transient intensive care, with mechanical ventilation from day 4 to day 11 for one of them. Differentiating granular cells were present in peripheral blood of all patients from the day 5, 12 and 8 of cytotoxic therapy. For the three patients, the number of days with white blood cell count < 1 x 10(9)/l was only 2, 7 and 11 days respectively. These results suggest that differentiation therapy with ATRA may be useful even in hyperleukocytic APL patients, when ATRA is used in combination with chemotherapy. The mechanisms of this putative beneficial effect are discussed.","['Dombret, H', 'Sutton, L', 'Duarte, M', 'Daniel, M T', 'Leblond, V', 'Castaigne, S', 'Degos, L']","['Dombret H', 'Sutton L', 'Duarte M', 'Daniel MT', 'Leblond V', 'Castaigne S', 'Degos L']","['Service Clinique des Maladies du Sang, Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Dec;6(12):1237-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, relapse occurs in approximately 30% of these children. The objective of this study was to determine whether the outcome of patients in clinical remission at the end of induction therapy could be predicted using a highly sensitive method to detect residual disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All children diagnosed with B-lineage ALL at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during a 2-year period were eligible. The extent of residual leukemia was quantitated in remission marrow samples obtained at the end of induction therapy in 44 children using a phage clonogenic assay in association with complementarity-determining-region 3 (CDR3)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Residual disease was a significant predictor of outcome independent of WBC count, age, or sex. The estimated relapse-free survival (RFS) during therapy was 50.4% (+/- 12.6%) for patients with high residual disease (> or = 0.6% leukemia cells among total marrow B cells) versus 91.9% (+/- 5.5%) for those with lower levels (P < .002). There were no significant differences in off-treatment RFS between patients with high or low residual disease who completed therapy in continuous remission (P = .82). The overall estimated RFS was 32.3% (+/- 11.6%) for patients with high residual disease versus 62.6% (+/- 10.7%) for patients with lower levels of residual leukemia cells, with a median follow-up of 5.3 years for patients in continuous remission (P < .008).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four children were treated from June 1979 through December 1990. The conditioning regimen included total-body irradiation (TBI) in 54 cases and busulfan in 20. Prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) consisted of cyclosporine (CycloA) plus methotrexate (MTX) for 38 patients, MTX for 17, CycloA for 18, and T depletion without other prophylaxis for one. The mean value of the interval from diagnosis to transplantation was 167 days. RESULTS: Sixteen patients died of transplant-related complications, 12 relapsed, and 46 are alive in continuous remission with a median follow-up of 46 months. We examined results obtained over three successive periods: 1979 to 1982 (n = 14 children), 1983 to 1986 (n = 29), and 1987 to 1990 (n = 31). Probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) were 43%, 48%, and 82% for the three successive periods, respectively (P < .02). This improvement in EFS was linked to a decreased risk of transplant-related mortality: 36%, 36%, and 3%, respectively (P < .01). Other factors associated with a better EFS in the univariate analysis were a short time interval from diagnosis to transplant (< 120 days), the absence of significant (grade > or = 2) acute GVHD, and the absence of chronic GVHD. In the multivariate analysis, two factors had a favorable impact on long-term survival: the year of transplantation (years 1987 to 1990 v others) and the absence of acute GVHD. CONCLUSION: The outcome for children receiving allogeneic BMT in first CR of AML has improved in France during recent years.","['Michel, G', 'Gluckman, E', 'Blaise, D', 'Esperou-Bourdeau, H', 'Vernant, J P', 'Kuentz, M', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Milpied, N', 'Rubie, H', 'Thuret, I']","['Michel G', 'Gluckman E', 'Blaise D', 'Esperou-Bourdeau H', 'Vernant JP', 'Kuentz M', 'Bordigoni P', 'Milpied N', 'Rubie H', 'Thuret I', 'et al.']","['Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*surgery', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Dec;10(12):1865-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.12.1865.,,['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.12.1865 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to predict clinical response to IFN, bone marrow samples from 15 CML patients were incubated with serial dilutions of IFN alpha-2b to obtain the IC50 values for erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM). A dose-dependent inhibition of at least one lineage was observed in all but one sample. An inhibitory effect of greater than 50% was reached for BFU-E in 8/14 patients and for CFU-GM in 10/14 patients. All three patients with no response (NR) to IFN treatment had IFN-sensitive BFU-E and CFU-GM. In four patients with hematologic remission (HR) or partial hematologic remission (PHR), BFU-E or CFU-GM were affected very little by the inhibitory effect of IFN. These observations suggest no predictive value for pretesting IFN sensitivity in vitro. The in vivo effect of IFN on the hemopoietic progenitor cells BFU-E and CFU-GM was evaluated in patients treated with either IFN alpha-2b alone (n = 11), or in combination with low dose IFN gamma (n = 10). All patients were newly diagnosed and not pretreated. After a median treatment duration of 11 months (range 3-25) a significant decrease in BFU-E and CFU-GM was observed in both groups of patients.

Five members of this family (MYC, SCL, TAL-2, LYL-1 and E2A) are implicated in oncogenic events in human lymphoid tumors because of their consistent involvement in chromosomal translocations. Although activated in T cell leukemias, expression of SCL and LYL-1 is low or undetectable in normal T cell populations. SCL is expressed in erythroid, megakaryocyte and mast cell populations (the same cell lineages as GATA-1, a zinc-finger transcription factor). In addition, both SCL and GATA-1 undergo coordinate modulation during chemically induced erythroid differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells and are down-modulated during myeloid differentiation of human K562 cells, thus implying a role for SCL in erythroid differentiation events. However, in contrast to GATA-1, SCL is expressed in the developing brain. Studies of the function of SCL suggest it is also important in proliferation and self-renewal events in erythroid cells.","['Green, A R', 'Begley, C G']","['Green AR', 'Begley CG']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1992 Sep;10(5):269-76. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530100504.,,['10.1002/stem.5530100504 [doi]'],,['SCL'],48,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cloned receptor molecule is a 66 kDa membrane protein that is structurally related to a large superfamily of haemopoietin/growth factor receptors. The 66 kDa EpoR alone is capable of binding to erythropoietin (Epo) with nanomolar affinity. The native EpoR may form dimers before or after binding Epo. EpoR dimers and/or associated molecules are probably necessary for high-affinity Epo binding. The 66 kDa EpoR probably exists as a protein complex with as yet unidentified proteins of 100 and 85 kDa. The molecular mechanism of Epo signal transduction remains largely undefined. The possible role of the EpoR in human diseases has been studied in a variety of clinical conditions. A structurally abnormal EpoR gene has been identified in a human erythroleukemia cell line. In polycythemia vera, red cell progenitors exhibit exaggerated sensitivity to Epo and express only low-affinity EpoR. Some cases of hereditary polycythemia may be due to a mutant EpoR conferring enhanced Epo sensitivity. Other pathologic conditions may also be associated with abnormalities of the EpoR or its associated molecules. Soluble, immunoreactive EpoR is detectable in human serum, but its physiological significance is unknown.","['Winkelmann, J C']",['Winkelmann JC'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology', 'Polycythemia/etiology', 'Protein Conformation', '*Receptors, Erythropoietin/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/etiology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1992 Sep;10(5):254-61. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530100502.,,['10.1002/stem.5530100502 [doi]'],,,52,,['R01DK44134/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The results will, we hope, provide a consensus on the proper times and counts that require prophylactic use of components for these patients. Because these patients use the vast majority of components (see Table 15), their proper use is imperative to maintaining an adequate platelet and frozen plasma supply. Transfusion support in cancer patients is vital for their survival. Platelets, in particular, are necessary to prevent serious bleeding. The risks from transfusion must always be considered. Fortunately, with increased monitoring of the blood supply, they have been reduced. As with any therapeutic regimen, these risks must be weighed against the benefit the patient may gain.

Mice were infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus, a retrovirus which causes immunosuppression with the development of functional murine AIDS. Increasing doses of cocaine given by daily intraperitoneal injection for 11 weeks reduced body weight. A daily cocaine injection in some mice as well as a saline injection in others showed a decrease in the percentage of Thy 1.2+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells, while both treatments increased the percentage and absolute numbers of B-cells per spleen. Saline and cocaine treatment induced an increase in gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha production by splenocytes. Cocaine treatment favored a decrease in sIL-2R secretion. Saline and cocaine treatment had slightly different effects on the splenocytes of protein-malnourished mice. Cocaine treatment induced an increase in the percentage of CD8+ cells. Saline and cocaine treatments decreased the number of Mac 1+ cells in the spleen. Moreover, saline- and cocaine-treated protein-malnourished mice splenocytes did not present the increase in gamma-IFN production as well-nourished mice splenocytes showed. Retrovirus-infected mice showed a decrease in the percentage of Thy 1.2+ and CD8+ cells and an increase in the percentage and absolute numbers of CD4+, IL-2R+, Mac 1+ and B-cells. Cocaine partially prevented the enlargement of lymphoid organs due to lymphoid cell proliferation induced by murine retrovirus infection, but had little effect on the elevated percentage of CD4+ cells or B-cells or the depressed numbers of CD8+ cells associated with virus infection. However, cocaine did reduce the number of activated IL-2R+ cells and macrophages (Mac 1+) in addition to reducing the total number of cells per spleen in all subsets in retrovirus-infected mice, but not in uninfected controls. Cocaine treatment and retrovirus infection alone or in combination suppressed the release of sIL-2R into supernatant fluid during in vitro culture of splenocytes. These data illustrate that cocaine treatment modulates cell proliferation in retrovirus-infected mice and thus modifies the absolute number of cells in those subsets already altered by retrovirus infection. Retrovirus-infected and retrovirus-infected cocaine-treated protein-malnourished mice showed similar results.","['Lopez, M C', 'Chen, G J', 'Huang, D S', 'Wang, Y', 'Watson, R R']","['Lopez MC', 'Chen GJ', 'Huang DS', 'Wang Y', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, Arizona Health Sciences Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'I5Y540LHVR (Cocaine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cocaine/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/pathology', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Protein-Energy Malnutrition/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Spleen/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1992 Oct;14(7):1153-63. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(92)90050-u.,,"['0192-0561(92)90050-U [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(92)90050-u [doi]']",,,,,"['AA08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 04827/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We found that YT cells, a human NK like cell line, expressed Fc epsilon RII after IL-1 stimulation. Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RII on IL-1-stimulated YT cells as well as the transfectant of Fc epsilon RII-cDNA (YTSER) resulted in the up-regulation of IL-2R alpha (p55/Tac). A 59 kDa protein phosphorylated at tyrosine residues was co-immunoprecipitated with Fc epsilon RII from YTSER lysate using H107 anti-Fc epsilon RII mAb. YTSER not only expressed Fc epsilon RII on their surface but also secreted soluble form of Fc epsilon RII (sFc epsilon RII/sCD23; IgE binding factor). Affinity purification revealed that sFc epsilon RII released from YTSER is heterogeneous and consisted of several proteins differing in molecular weight.

It is conceivable that c-myc inhibits differentiation by a mechanism that is related to its normal role in the cell, possibly by regulating transcription of genes involved in growth promotion. As was previously found for all of the other known activities of c-Myc, the HLH and LZ dimerization motifs are absolutely necessary for inhibition of MEL cell differentiation.

Division of the cases into two prognostically different groups, i.e. systemic mastocytosis, in which the skin lesions of urticaria pigmentosa are present and the prognosis is favourable, and malignant mastocytosis, in which there is no cutaneous involvement and the prognosis is poor, revealed that all six lymph nodes exhibiting leukaemic infiltrates came from the malignant mastocytosis group; eosinophilia, plasmacytosis and fibrosis were seen significantly more often in malignant than in systemic mastocytosis, but blood vessel hyperplasia and germinal centre hyperplasia were encountered with the same high frequency in both groups; and mast cell atypia tended to be more pronounced in malignant mastocytosis; this diagnosis could therefore easily be missed without naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase staining.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Horny, H P', 'Kaiserling, E', 'Parwaresch, M R', 'Lennert, K']","['Horny HP', 'Kaiserling E', 'Parwaresch MR', 'Lennert K']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/immunology/*pathology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 1992 Nov;21(5):439-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1992.tb00428.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1992.tb00428.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In germ-free mice, although MHC class I molecules such as H-2K and thymus leukemia antigen (TLa) were expressed on the small intestinal epithelium, class II molecules were absent. The introduction of microorganisms into germ-free mice induced characteristic MHC molecules on the small intestinal epithelial cells. The I-A molecule was induced on the villus tip and crypt epithelial cells 7 days after conventionalization, and the I-E molecule was induced on the mid villus and crypt epithelial cells 14 days after conventionalization. The staining intensity of the H-2K molecules was increased 4 days after conventionalization. In contrast, TLa did not change during conventionalization of germ-free mice. These results suggest that the expression of MHC molecules, except for the TLa, is greatly dependent on the presence of intestinal microorganisms.","['Matsumoto, S', 'Setoyama, H', 'Umesaki, Y']","['Matsumoto S', 'Setoyama H', 'Umesaki Y']","['Yakult Central Institute for Microbiological Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/*growth & development', 'Germ-Free Life', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*analysis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Intestine, Small/*immunology/*microbiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 1992 Dec;103(6):1777-82. doi: 10.1016/0016-5085(92)91434-6.,,"['0016-5085(92)91434-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0016-5085(92)91434-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our method differs from others in 1) the simplicity of our algorithms; 2) inclusion of touching (as well as nontouching) cells; and 3) use of these algorithms to segment as well as to detect nucleated cells employing conventionally prepared smears. Our method involves: 1) acquisition of spectral images; 2) preprocessing the acquired images; 3) detection of single and touching cells in the scene; 4) segmentation of the cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic regions; and 5) postprocessing of the segmented regions. The first two steps of this algorithm are employed to obtain high-quality images, to remove random noise, and to correct aberration and shading effects. Spectral information of the image is used in step 3 to segment the nucleated cells from the rest of the scene. Using the initial cell masks, nucleated cells which are just touching are detected and separated. Simple features are then extracted and conditions applied such that single nucleated cells are finally selected. In step 4, the intensity variations of the cells are then used to segment the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The success rate in segmenting the nucleated cells is between 81 and 93%. The major errors in segmentation of the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the recognized nucleated cells are 3.5% and 2.2%, respectively.","['Poon, S S', 'Ward, R K', 'Palcic, B']","['Poon SS', 'Ward RK', 'Palcic B']","['Cancer Imaging, B.C.

Neoplastic transformation may result from excessive expression or, conversely, complete loss of functional products (eg tumour suppressor proteins not described here). The second mechanism involves mutation by protein fusion (or truncation) and illustrates the modular composition of transcriptional proteins. The loss or inappropriate combination of specific modules creates chimaeric proteins with presumably altered transcriptional properties that may contribute to the neoplastic phenotype. Both mechanisms underscore the importance of cognate interactions, particularly heterodimerization between various transcriptional proteins with other members of the transcription complex.

These two diverse types of oncogenes act together to generate a more malignant phenotype than would be expected merely from a summation of the individual oncogene effects. The aspects of normal growth control and the regulation of differentiation, which are altered in this system to generate the leukaemic phenotype, include changes in the balance between proliferation versus maturation, altered expression of differentiation genes and changes in growth factor responsiveness.

Upon introduction into bone marrow cells, bcr-abl can cause acute or chronic leukaemias in mice and can stimulate the growth of many cell types, including multipotent stem cells, in vitro. Although their growth is stimulated, these cells are not fully malignant blastic leukaemias.

The first stage results from the mitogenic stimulation of EPO-R by gp55. In the second stage, multiple proviral integrations appear to result in further transformation of the SFFV infected erythroblast to a leukaemogenic state. The first stage results from EPO-R activation. After retroviral entry, mediated through an unknown receptor, and after cDNA synthesis and proviral integration, viral proteins are synthesized. Gp55 binds and activates EPO-R. A small but measurable amount of gp55-EPO-R complex is transported to the cell surface (Casadewall et al, 1991). In the presence of helper virus, the defective SFFV genome is packaged and released for subsequent rounds of infection. During the first stage, erythroblasts proliferate but are not tumorigenic. During the second stage of Friend disease, subsequent infections result in further proviral integrations in the host genome. Some of these integrations result in increased Spi-1 expression, whereas others result in decreased p53 expression. These events appear to account for the leukaemogenic properties of cells at this stage, 4-6 weeks after the initial SFFV infection. The interaction between EPO-R and gp55 persists at this later stage, although its contribution to the malignant phenotype of the MEL cells is not known. The sequence of events during stage 1 and stage 2 does not appear to have absolute requirements. Starting with IL-3 dependent immortalized Ba/F3 cells, which already have some unknown proliferative mutation (Mathey-Prevot et al, 1986), gp55 and EPO-R can subsequently be introduced, resulting in tumorigenicity (Li et al, 1990). The primary focus of this review has been the early mitogenic stage of Friend disease. Several concepts have emerged regarding the interaction between gp55 and EPO-R. The interaction between the polypeptides is highly specific, occurs in the extracytoplasmic regions and the transmembrane region of the polypeptides and occurs within the same cell, not via cell-cell contact. Both EPO and gp55 activate EPO-R, via different binding sites, resulting in increased cellular tyrosine kinase activity. The first stage of Friend disease is an example of how a non-oncogene bearing retrovirus can induce leukaemia. The env gene of the SFFV is not a classical oncogene. It does not appear to be derived from a normal cellular proto-oncogene. The interaction of gp55 and EPO-R therefore supports the ""receptor mediated leukaemogenesis"" hypothesis (McGrath and Weissman, 1978, 1979).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","[""D'Andrea, A D""]","[""D'Andrea AD""]","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1992;15:19-36.,,,,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal loss or deletion are the hallmarks of tumour suppressor genes, suggesting that a gene(s) located on 5q may function as a leukaemia suppressor gene. To determine the location of genes on 5q that may be involved in myeloid leukaemogenesis, we examined the breakpoints of the del(5q) in a series of 117 patients with malignant myeloid diseases. By comparing the breakpoints, we identified a small segment of 5q, consisting of band 5q31, that was deleted in each patient. This segment has been termed the critical region. A striking number of genes encoding haematopoietic growth factors have been mapped within or adjacent to the critical region. These include the genes encoding CSF-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-9. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have refined the localization of these genes to 5q31.1. To facilitate the identification of a tumour suppressor gene on 5q, we are currently preparing a physical map of 5q31. With FISH analysis of a series of cosmid and phage clones, we identified a number of clones within 5q31. By hybridizing these probes to metaphase cells with a del(5q) involving proximal or distal breakpoints within 5q31, we have narrowed the critical region to a small segment of 5q31 containing eight of the cosmids. In addition, we found that the five growth factor genes are excluded from this region. We have used dual colour FISH to determine the order of these cosmids, the order of the known genes mapped to 5q23-33 and the relationship of these genes to the critical region. To date, mutations of these genes in leukaemia cells have not been identified. The clinical features of myeloid diseases associated with a del(5q) are variable (RA 5q- syndrome v.

In transgenic models, tumorigenesis can be accelerated by introducing another oncogene or by using a retrovirus as an insertional mutagen to identify cellular genes that collaborate with the transgene. Leukaemogenesis can be promoted by some ten pairs of oncogenes. The myc nuclear oncoprotein, for example, can collaborate with cytoplasmic oncoproteins such as ras, raf, bcl-2, pim-1 and v-abl, as well as with nuclear products such as bmi-1 or the tumour suppressor p53. The genes in such partnerships seem to provide complementary functions. For example, myc seems to prevent cells from becoming quiescent, whereas bcl-2 blocks programmed cell death; and others, for example ras, may diminish growth factor requirements. The products of genes that collaborate may lie on separate signal transduction pathways, leading to distinct nuclear targets.

Depletion of cellular glutathione (GSH) levels in the resistant cells produced a 1.76-fold increase in MMC-dependent lipid peroxidation. MMC cytotoxicity was also increased significantly by GSH depletion in P388/R-84 cells. These results suggest that cellular resistance to MMC in P388/R-84 cells may, at least in part, be due to the reduced formation of oxyradicals in these cells.","['Xu, B H', 'Singh, S V']","['Xu BH', 'Singh SV']","['Mercy Cancer Center, Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA 15219.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/14 00:00,1992/09/14 00:01,['1992/09/14 00:00'],"['1992/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1992 Sep 14;66(1):49-53. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(92)90279-5.,,"['0304-3835(92)90279-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(92)90279-5 [doi]']",,,,,['CA 50638/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

In striking contrast, the survival of L1210 leukemic mice is only marginally prolonged by DFMO treatment. This inconsistency is due to the fact, that in the mouse the tumor cells can utilize extracellular polyamines to compensate for the decrease in putrescine and spermidine synthesis caused by DFMO treatment. In the present study, we demonstrate that a reduction in the transport of polyamines into the tumor cells is a more effective means of increasing the therapeutic effect of DFMO than is a reduction in the supply of extracellular polyamines. DFMO treatment cured 30-75% of leukemic mice bearing mutant L1210-MGBGr cells deficient in polyamine uptake, but only slightly increased the survival time of leukemic mice bearing the parental L1210 cells despite the fact that the supply of extracellular polyamines was reduced (by feeding the mice a polyamine-deficient diet containing antibiotics). The effectiveness by which DFMO cured leukemic mice bearing L1210-MGBGr cells appeared to be sex dependent. Thus, 58% of the female mice, as compared to 30% of the male mice, were cured by DFMO treatment.","['Ask, A', 'Persson, L', 'Heby, O']","['Ask A', 'Persson L', 'Heby O']","['Department of Oncology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Polyamines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Drug Resistance', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitoguazone/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Polyamines/*metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Sex Factors', 'Spermidine/pharmacokinetics', 'Spermine/pharmacokinetics', 'Tritium']",1992/09/14 00:00,1992/09/14 00:01,['1992/09/14 00:00'],"['1992/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1992 Sep 14;66(1):29-34. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(92)90276-2.,,"['0304-3835(92)90276-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(92)90276-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most of these reports included patients treated with different protocols. Therefore, some bias has been involved in the evaluation of the prognostic factors in such reports. METHODS: The authors studied the morphologic, cytogenetic, and clinical features of 136 patients (86 males and 50 females) with de novo ANLL treated with the same protocol of intensive induction chemotherapy using multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Chromosome abnormalities were detected in 62.5% of the patients. The overall complete remission (CR) rate of disease was 85.5% in these patients. More than 90% of the patients with t(8;21) and pseudodiploid abnormalities achieved experienced CR. However, CR rates in the patients with abnormalities of chromosome 5 or 7 were 50%. With multivariate analyses by the type of karyotypic abnormality, CR duration and survival time of the patients with t(8;21) were longer than those of patients with normal karyotype and abnormalities of chromosome 5 or 7. Abnormalities of chromosome 5 or 7 and hyperdiploid were associated with poor prognosis. Older age and lower platelet counts also were factors contributing to shorter survival times. With the analysis with French-American-British (FAB) classification, only hypoplastic leukemia was a poor prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cytogenetic analyses plays an important role in estimating the prognosis of patients treated with intensive induction chemotherapy.","['Tashiro, S', 'Kyo, T', 'Tanaka, K', 'Oguma, N', 'Hashimoto, T', 'Dohy, H', 'Kamada, N']","['Tashiro S', 'Kyo T', 'Tanaka K', 'Oguma N', 'Hashimoto T', 'Dohy H', 'Kamada N']","['Department of Hematology, Research Institute for Nuclear Medicine and Biology, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Dec 15;70(12):2809-15. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921215)70:12<2809::aid-cncr2820701214>3.0.co;2-#.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19921215)70:12<2809::aid-cncr2820701214>3.0.co;2-# [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further studies demonstrate that these cells are also highly defective in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced differentiation to macrophages. Analysis of this system demonstrates that certain protooncogenes which may contribute to differentiation are expressed at similar levels in sensitive and resistant cells. Thus, treatment of cells with TPA results in a reduction in the levels of c-myb and c-myc mRNA, while the expression of c-fos, c-jun, and junB is greatly enhanced. Immunoprecipitation experiments also demonstrate a TPA induced increase in the c-jun protein in both sensitive and resistant cells. Gel mobility shift assays show that TPA induces AP-1 formation in sensitive cells, whereas in parallel experiments with the HL-60/Vinc isolate, AP-1 is essentially absent. It has been found, however, that in resistant cells which have reverted to drug sensitivity, the levels of TPA inducible AP-1 is essentially identical to that of sensitive cells. Revertant and sensitive cells differentiate at similar levels in the presence of TPA. These studies therefore demonstrate that HL-60/Vinc cells are defective in the TPA induction of a functional AP-1 complex and that this may account for the inability of these cells to differentiate to macrophages.

In the cells of a patient with T cell lymphoma, although microtubules were not visible in the lymphoma cells from lymph nodes, they became visible after 72 hours in culture with concanavalin A (Con A) and interferon alpha. Cap formation was observed with antitubulin monoclonal antibody in the peripheral blood lymphocytes from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient, but well-developed microtubules were observed on other occasions in the same patient. There were no obvious structural differences between microtubules in T and B cell lymphoid malignancies, but leukemia cells and lymphoma cells with irregularly shaped nuclei, such as adult T cell leukemia cells and B cell lymphoma cells with cleaved nuclei, had complicated microtubules surrounding their irregular nuclei. In general, after blastogenic stimuli with phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P), Con A, and pokeweed mitogen (PWM), the development of the microtubules was proportional to the incorporation of 3H thymidine (3H-TDR). In most cases, after incubation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interferon alpha, the number of intact cells decreased and the number of degenerated cells increased, but the intact cells had intact microtubules.","['Hirose, Y', 'Konda, S']","['Hirose Y', 'Konda S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa Pref., Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microtubules/*ultrastructure', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells. 1992;18(2):225-38; discussion 239-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) have been demonstrated to enhance the metabolism and cytotoxic effects of HIDAC against leukemic progenitor cells. We examined the effect of pIXY 321 (a GM-CSF/IL-3 fusion protein) on HIDAC-induced PCD and related gene expressions as well as HIDAC-mediated colony growth inhibition of human myeloid leukemia cells. Unlike the previously described effects of HGFs on normal bone marrow progenitor cells, exposure to pIXY 321 alone for up to 24 hours did not suppress PCD in HL-60 or KG-1 cells. However, exposure to pIXY 321 for 20 hours followed by a combined treatment with Ara-C plus pIXY 321 for 4 or 24 hours versus treatment with Ara-C alone significantly enhanced the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of PCD. This was temporally associated with a marked induction of c-jun expression and a significant decrease in BCL-2. In addition, the treatment with pIXY 321 plus HIDAC versus HIDAC alone produced a significantly greater inhibition of HL-60 colony growth. These findings highlight an additional mechanism of HIDAC-induced leukemic cell death that is augmented by cotreatment with pIXY 321 and may contribute toward an improved antileukemic activity of HIDAC.","['Bhalla, K', 'Tang, C', 'Ibrado, A M', 'Grant, S', 'Tourkina, E', 'Holladay, C', 'Hughes, M', 'Mahoney, M E', 'Huang, Y']","['Bhalla K', 'Tang C', 'Ibrado AM', 'Grant S', 'Tourkina E', 'Holladay C', 'Hughes M', 'Mahoney ME', 'Huang Y']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Genes, jun/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 1;80(11):2883-90.,,['S0006-4971(20)72206-8 [pii]'],,"['BCL-2', 'c-jun', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 20 (77%) patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 61% to 93%). Loss of all or part of the long arm (q) of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 was observed in 17 (65%) patients (95% CI, 47% to 83%). In addition, the karyotypes were often complex, with multiple abnormalities and subclones. Among the remaining nine patients, six had a normal karyotype and one each had trisomy 8, t(3;3), or t(3;5). The overall frequency of abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 observed in our M6 patients is similar to that observed in our patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML; 99 of 129 patients, 77%), but substantially higher than that noted in our other patients with AML de novo (French-American-British [FAB] subtypes M1-M5: 52 of 334 patients, 16%). Our M6 patients with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 were older and had a shorter median survival (16 v 77 weeks [P = .005]) than did the M6 patients without these abnormalities. We found no correlation between morphologic features and either cytogenetic abnormalities or clinical outcome. Of note was the finding that the percentage of myeloblasts, which may account for only a small fraction of the total marrow elements when the revised FAB criteria are applied, had no bearing on prognosis. We conclude that acute erythroblastic leukemia, when defined by morphologic criteria, consists of two distinctive subgroups: one group tends to be older, has complex cytogenetic abnormalities, especially of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, and shares biologic and clinical features with t-AML; the other group, with simple or no detectable cytogenetic abnormalities, has a more favorable prognosis when treated with intensive chemotherapy.","['Olopade, O I', 'Thangavelu, M', 'Larson, R A', 'Mick, R', 'Kowal-Vern, A', 'Schumacher, H R', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Rowley, J D']","['Olopade OI', 'Thangavelu M', 'Larson RA', 'Mick R', 'Kowal-Vern A', 'Schumacher HR', 'Le Beau MM', 'Vardiman JW', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 1;80(11):2873-82.,,['S0006-4971(20)72205-6 [pii]'],,,,,"['CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent studies have shown an upstream deletion activating expression of SCL/tal to be one of the most common genetic lesions in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The cDNA sequence of SCL/tal encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein with regions of marked homology to lyl-1 and tal-2, two other bHLH proteins involved in T-ALL chromosomal translocations. The bHLH motif suggests that the SCL/tal product localizes to the nucleus, binds to specific DNA sequences, and regulates transcription of a specific array of target genes. Our studies directly identify the SCL/tal product as a 42-Kd phosphoprotein that efficiently localizes to the nucleus. Deletion mutagenesis has allowed identification of a region critical for nuclear localization, a region that corresponds to the DNA-binding basic domain within the bHLH motif. Because this domain is shared by lyl-1 and tal-2, these latter putative T-cell oncoproteins probably use a nuclear localization mechanism identical to that of SCL/tal.","['Goldfarb, A N', 'Goueli, S', 'Mickelson, D', 'Greenberg, J M']","['Goldfarb AN', 'Goueli S', 'Mickelson D', 'Greenberg JM']","['University of Minnesota Hospital Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 1;80(11):2858-66.,,['S0006-4971(20)72203-2 [pii]'],,['SCL/tal'],,,['CA-01254/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Progression or recurrence was documented in 30 patients and was more common in irradiated sites. PAVe was well tolerated acutely. There were no treatment related fatalities. Twenty-three (14%) patients were admitted to the hospital for neutropenic fever. Five second malignancies have occurred after PAVe/RT only: one myelodysplastic syndrome, one acute myelogenous leukemia, one non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and two solid tumors including a case of non-small cell lung cancer and an in situ carcinoma of the cervix. Three patients died from myocardial infarction several years after the completion of treatment. These mature data show that PAVe/RT is effective and well-tolerated therapy for locally extensive stage II and IIIA/B HD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Horning, S J', 'Ang, P T', 'Hoppe, R T', 'Rosenberg, S A']","['Horning SJ', 'Ang PT', 'Hoppe RT', 'Rosenberg SA']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'PAVe protocol 1']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1992 Nov;3(9):747-54. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058333.,,"['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058333 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)65381-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This system is based on the tumor score which consists of assigning a point to each one of five variables that have been previously shown to have a high prognostic value. Ann Arbor stages III-IV, presence of bulky mass, elevation of B-2 microglobulin and LDH as well as presence of 'B' symptoms are the variables utilized in this system. When we applied this tumor score system to a population of 144 patients uniformly treated with CHOP/Bleo/CMED protocol, we observed that this system can accurately divide the population into two prognostic groups without an intermediate category. The first group is made up of those patients with a score of 0-2 points while the second group consists of patients with a score of > or = 3 points. The first group has a time-to-treatment failure (TTF) of 83% at three years in contrast to the second group whose TTF was 24%. If we compare this system with other commonly used systems in our institution, such as Ann Arbor, M.D. Anderson clinical staging system, and M.D. Anderson serological staging system, we observed that the tumor score system is not only more specific and sensitive than the others but also was capable of eliminating an intermediate risk group, thus facilitating therapeutic choices. This tumor score system is easy to apply and potentially reproducible in any institution.","['Rodriguez, J', 'Cabanillas, F', 'McLaughlin, P', 'Swan, F', 'Rodriguez, M', 'Hagemeister, F', 'Romaguera, J']","['Rodriguez J', 'Cabanillas F', 'McLaughlin P', 'Swan F', 'Rodriguez M', 'Hagemeister F', 'Romaguera J']","['Department of Hematology, U.

To explore the transport mechanism of PGA2 and the possible role of cellular glutathione (GSH) in the transport process, we prepared GSH-enriched and -depleted L-1210 cells and then incubated with [3H] PGA2. In GSH-depleted cells, the total amount of PGA2 incorporated was reduced to about 50% of that in the control and GSH-enriched cells, accompanied by marked reduction of the PG in the cytosol but not in the nuclei. The kinetics of uptake revealed that the apparent Vmax was reduced by GSH depletion. Subsequent study of L-1210 cells under culture conditions provided similar results; GSH-depletion caused suppression of PG uptake and a reduction in the amount of PGA2 in cytosol, while its nuclear accumulation was little influenced. Comparison of the effect of PGA2 on the growth of control and GSH-depleted cells showed that the PG suppressed cell proliferation to the same extent. Our results suggest that, though uptake of PGA2 may be significantly influenced, its accumulation, and hence the manifestation of its biological effects are not influenced by GSH status.","['Ohno, K', 'Hirata, M', 'Narumiya, S', 'Fukushima, M']","['Ohno K', 'Hirata M', 'Narumiya S', 'Fukushima M']","['Shionogi Research Laboratories, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eicosanoids,Eicosanoids,8906009,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K6VT5BDY9E (prostaglandin A2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Glutathione/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Prostaglandins A/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eicosanoids. 1992;5(2):81-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of normal erythroid maturation results in a finite number of cell divisions accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of hemoglobin. Friend erythroleukemia cells treated with hexamethylene bisacetamide differentiate in a similar manner, while agents such as hemin apparently induce differentiation without limiting cell proliferation. Aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, has been reported to induce differentiation in the absence of cell proliferation. Using these three chemicals we have investigated the relationship between cell proliferation and erythrocytic maturation by exposing Friend erythroleukemia cells to either hexamethylene bisacetamide (5 mM), hemin (100 microM), or aphidicolin 1.2 microM) and examining the effects on cell growth, morphology, and hemoglobin production. Proliferation in the presence of hexamethylene bisacetamide is limited to four to five rounds of cell division, while hemin has no inhibitory effect. Hexamethylene bisacetamide initiates the complete erythrocytic maturation program, including cellular structural changes and hemoglobin synthesis. Hemin stimulates only globin gene transcription, not differentiation. Aphidicolin inhibits cell growth within 24 h, but does not induce differentiation. Furthermore, inhibition of proliferation by aphidicolin prevents subsequent hexamethylene bisacetamide induced differentiation. These results indicate that at least one round of cell division is required for initiation of erythrocytic differentiation.","['Spriggs, L L', 'Hill, S M', 'Jeter, J R Jr']","['Spriggs LL', 'Hill SM', 'Jeter JR Jr']","['Department of Pharmacology, Tulane University, School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/07/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/07/11 19:15'],"['1992/07/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/07/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1992 Jul;70(7):555-64. doi: 10.1139/o92-086.,,['10.1139/o92-086 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment.,73-89,"The prognosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in childhood has improved steadily in the last 2 decades. This is primarily the result of increasingly effective chemotherapy regimens tailored to defined and relatively homogeneous prognostic categories and tested in prospective clinical trials. Surgical excision remains of prognostic benefit only when near-total resection can be performed without delay of chemotherapy. The role of radiation therapy is now limited to the treatment of overt central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, disease unresponsive to chemotherapy, and certain emergencies. Effective 'prophylactic' treatment of the CNS has been achieved in most series by intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy alone. The most relevant modality of treatment is chemotherapy and a very large number of protocols have been published. The origins of current multi-agent regimens stem both from early experience with cyclophosphamide in endemic Burkitt's lymphoma and from therapeutic studies of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Sub-stratification of non-localized NHL has produced protocols designed for either lymphoblastic (mostly T cell) or non-lymphoblastic (mostly B cell) categories. While the cure rate for lymphoblastic lymphoma now exceed 70%, the non-localized non-lymphoblastic disease remains a major obstacle to cure. These patients frequently present with large abdominal primaries and are prone to regional as well as hematogenous dissemination. In particular, involvement of the CNS is now considered to be the most adverse prognostic variable in this group. Recently, highly intensive regimens are addressing these obstacles. On the other hand, NHL defined as localized has been shown to be curable in up to 95% of children with the use of simple chemotherapy regimens as short as 6 months in duration. Salvage of patients who relapse during or after chemotherapy remains bleak but cures are possible with regimens incorporating bone marrow transplantation from either an autologous or allogeneic source. Experimental methods, including biologic and immune response modifiers may also offer future promise.","['White, L', 'Siegel, S E', 'Quah, T C']","['White L', 'Siegel SE', 'Quah TC']","[""Oncology Programme, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'COMP protocol', 'LSA2-L2 protocol', 'VAP-cyclo protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1992 Jul;13(1):73-89. doi: 10.1016/1040-8428(92)90017-k.,,"['1040-8428(92)90017-K [pii]', '10.1016/1040-8428(92)90017-k [doi]']",,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,

Action of 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine.",1819-27,"Cellular metabolism studies had demonstrated previously that low cellular concentrations of 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) nucleotides are eliminated by deoxycytidylate deaminase (dCMPD), whereas dCMPD activity is inhibited at high cellular dFdC nucleotide levels (Heinemann et al., Cancer Res 52: 533-539, 1992). An assay for measuring dCMPD activity in intact human leukemia cells has now been developed to permit investigations of the interactions of dFdC nucleotides with dCMPD in intact cells in which the regulated nature of this enzyme was not disrupted. Using [14C]dCyd as the substrate, radioactivity that accumulated in dTTP was quantitated after high-pressure liquid chromotography by a radioactive flow detector. The assay was first characterized using either the dCMPD inhibitor tetrahydrodeoxyuridine (H4dUrd) which directly inhibits dCMPD, or thymidine and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) which indirectly inhibit and activate dCMPD, respectively, by affecting the cellular dCTP:dTTP value. Measured by this in situ assay, there was a strong correlation between dCMPD activity and dCTP:dTTP levels. Consistent with previous studies using partially purified enzyme, incubation of cells with dFdC resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of dCMPD in situ. The mechanism of modulation of dCMPD by dFdC, however, was clearly different from that of thymidine and FdUrd. In addition to the effect of dFdC on cellular dCTP:dTTP, our findings also suggested an additional inhibitory mechanism, possibly a direct interaction between dCMPD and dFdC 5'-triphosphate.

Ara-A inhibits DNA polymerase and DNA synthesis. Because its efficacy in vivo as an anticancer agent is limited by its rapid inactivation by ADA, ara-A was combined with dCF to produce cytoreductive levels of ara-A. Twenty-four patients were assigned to receive dCF alone and 25 to receive the combination. No patient responded to dCF alone, and one patient developed a complete remission after treatment with the combination. The toxicity of dCF alone was minimal, except for one patient who became obtunded on day 5 following the first cycle of therapy. In contrast, five patients developed severe toxicity with the combination, including renal failure (three patients), hepatic failure (three patients), and neurologic toxicity (two patients). These results indicate that, at the doses and schedule used in this study, the combination of dCF and ara-A has significant toxicity and minimal activity against recurrent ALL in children.","['Miser, J S', 'Roloff, J', 'Blatt, J', 'Reaman, G H', 'Krailo, M D', 'Hammond, G D']","['Miser JS', 'Roloff J', 'Blatt J', 'Reaman GH', 'Krailo MD', 'Hammond GD']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Pentostatin/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1992 Dec;15(6):490-3. doi: 10.1097/00000421-199212000-00005.,,['10.1097/00000421-199212000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Cytologically, aspirates were characterized by intermediate-sized cells (9.5-18.5 microns) with fine nuclear chromatin, small, inconspicuous nucleoli, irregular nuclear contours and scant basophilic cytoplasm. Frequent mitotic figures were seen (1-14 figures per 1,000 cells). Fourteen cases demonstrated a T-cell phenotype with considerable phenotypic variability. One case demonstrated a precursor B-cell phenotype, and another demonstrated biphenotypic expression with both T-cell and myeloid differentiation. Eleven of 14 cases (79%) were positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Thirteen of 15 cases (87%) manifested diploid DNA content by flow cytometric analysis and were characterized by intermediate proliferative activity (S+G2M 12.7 +/- 8.7% SD) and intermediate mean RNA index (1.3 +/- .5 SD). T beta gene rearrangements were demonstrated in four of five phenotypic T-cell LBL cases analyzed, with concomitant JH gene rearrangements observed in three cases, confirming that bigenotypic rearrangements characterize some T-cell LBLs.

MCF recombinants could be involved during leukemogenesis at both preleukemic times and in late-stage tumors. Among the Cas-Br-E-induced non-T-, non-B-cell leukemias, viral integrations were found in the Fli-1 and Evi-1 region in 71% (36 out of 51) and 22% (16 out of 72) of the tumors analyzed, respectively. As an approach to evaluate the contribution of Cas-Br-E MCF recombinant formation in cis-activation of proto-oncogenes, we analyzed the structure of the Fli-1- and Evi-1-associated proviruses by Southern blot hybridization. In Fli-1, we found that the proviruses, ecotropic as well as MCF, are all integrated within a very short DNA region immediately upstream of the initiator ATG, toward the 3' end of a 5' exon (Ben-David, Giddens, Letwin, and Bernstein, 1991, Genes Dev. 5, 908-918). All proviruses are oriented the same way, in the 5' to 3' transcriptional sense. Both provirus types are able to direct the Fli-1 expression to the same extent presumably via a promoter insertion mechanism. Most of the proviruses had no detectable deletion and contained both 5' and 3' LTR sequences with similar U3 sequences. MCF recombinants did not show any selective advantage over ecotropic proviruses for the Fli-1 locus since the frequency of ecotropic to MCF-recombinant virus at the Fli-1 locus was identical to that observed at any other locus. This suggests that the formation of these MCF recombinants is not essential for activation of Fli-1 and that ecotropic Cas-Br-E already possesses the required sequences for full cis-activation of Fli-1. On the other hand, in Evi-1, there is a strict selection for ecotropic proviruses.

Urinary excretion of 6MP was measured in 46 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The proportion of unchanged drug excreted after oral dosage in the morning was greater than after an evening dose (5.6 +/- 3.3% vs. 3.3 +/- 2.4%). Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. In all children receiving 6MP in the morning, the drug was detected in urine at 2 and 4 h after ingestion. At 6 h, 6MP was still detectable in 77% of patients, at 8 h in 54%, at 10 h in 12%, and at 12 h in 8%. The reliability of urinary 6MP determination as a measure of drug compliance was assessed in 39 children accustomed to receiving their medication in the evening. 6MP was detected in 81% of first morning urine samples, indicating compliance with medication the preceding evening. The absence of 6MP in first morning urine samples did not necessarily indicate poor compliance because of the variability in 6MP excretion and unpredictable pattern of night voiding in children. The method was therefore a reliable measure of good short-term compliance. It also directed attention toward possible noncompliance in children with negative samples.","['Macdougall, L G', 'McElligott, S E', 'Ross, E', 'Greeff, M C', 'Poole, J E']","['Macdougall LG', 'McElligott SE', 'Ross E', 'Greeff MC', 'Poole JE']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Circadian Rhythm/physiology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*urine', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', '*Patient Compliance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*urine']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 1992 Oct;14(5):371-5. doi: 10.1097/00007691-199210000-00005.,,['10.1097/00007691-199210000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently examined autopsy and/or lung biopsy material from five children with fatal measles pneumonitis. Two patients were immunocompromised because of either prematurity or acute leukemia and died 13-16 days following onset of symptoms. Both had classic giant cell pneumonitis, with readily demonstrable intranuclear inclusions. Three other children without known immunocompromise had a more prolonged course. The lungs of these patients lacked the classic pattern and displayed instead a spectrum of less specific findings ranging from organizing diffuse alveolar damage to interstitial pneumonia with giant cells, but without viral inclusions. An accompanying necrotizing bronchiolitis was also present. Electron microscopy and/or detection of elevated measles-specific immunoglobulin M was necessary to confirm the diagnosis in these apparently immunocompetent patients. We conclude that the histologic features of fatal or serious measles pneumonitis are variable and depend to some extent on the immunocompetence of the host as well as the duration and tempo of the disease.

AgNORs-FCM can be applied to analyze clinico-pathological samples including neoplastic tissues, more quickly and quantitatively, than regular tissue staining with AgNORs.","['Mitsui, H']",['Mitsui H'],"['Department of Pathology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

Retinoids have clearly been shown to inhibit chemically induced mammary and urothelial carcinogenesis in experimental animals. Prohibitive toxicity of the parent compound, vitamin A, led to a systematic search for synthetic derivatives with an improved therapeutic index. More than 1500 such compounds have been synthesized, many retaining chemopreventive potential, but with less toxicity. Although several anecdotal reports confirming therapeutic benefits of cis-retinoic acid in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the remarkable studies of Huang and his colleagues in China in 1988 reporting complete remissions in patients with this uncommon variety of acute myelogenous leukemia with the transisomer of retinoic acid (all-trans-retinoic acid) led to a resurgence of interest in the retinoids as differentiating agents for the prevention and therapy of cancer. Furthermore, molecular studies showing DNA rearrangements of the alpha nuclear receptor for retinoic acid located on chromosome 17 in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, a disease invariably associated with a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, provided a direct connection between an altered nuclear receptor and the development of a human malignancy. The retinoids also may have important beneficial effects in prevention of recurrent malignancies once the primary tumor has been treated, such as in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Because retinoids appear to be less effective in inducing differentiation in nonpromyelocytic leukemia cells, investigators have conducted a number of studies to exploit potential synergism between retinoids and other differentiating agents or biologic effectors. Differentiation therapy and chemoprevention are attractive alternative approaches to intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is now clear that retinoids represent one class of compounds with which it may be possible to reverse the progression of malignant disease and prevent carcinogenesis.","['Tallman, M S', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Tallman MS', 'Wiernik PH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,['0 (Retinoids)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/prevention & control', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Retinoids/chemistry/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 1992 Oct;32(10):868-88. doi: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1992.tb04633.x.,,['10.1002/j.1552-4604.1992.tb04633.x [doi]'],,,215,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of recombinant human IRE-BP in murine cells has been examined as have the expressions of the endogenous IRE-BP of both human and rabbit cells. In all cases, iron down-modulated the RNA binding activity of the IRE-BP, but in no instance was this decrease in activity accompanied by a decrease in the level of the protein as judged by quantitative Western blots. Moreover, the rate of synthesis of the IRE-BP and its rate of degradation have been found to be unaltered by iron manipulation of cells in culture. Consistent with IRE-BP regulation occurring post-translationally, the iron regulation of its activity was found to be unaffected by cycloheximide.

Utilizing molecular sieve chromatography, heparin-agarose, chromatography, and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, RNK-Met-1 was purified to homogeneity and 25 NH2-terminal amino acids were sequenced. By using the polymerase chain reaction, oligonucleotide primers derived from amino acids at position 14-25 and from a downstream active site conserved in other serine protease genes were used to generate a 534-base pair cDNA clone encoding a novel serine protease from RNK-16 mRNA. This cDNA clone was used to isolate a full-length 867-base pair RNK-Met-1 cDNA from an RNK-16 lambda-gt11 library. The open reading frame predicts a mature protein of 238 amino acids with two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. The cDNA also encodes a leader peptide of at least 20 amino acids. The characteristic Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly amino acids of the NH2 terminus and the His, Asp, and Ser residues that form the catalytic triad of serine proteases were both conserved. The amino acid sequence has less than 45% identity with any other member of the serine protease family, indicating that RNK-Met-1 is distinct and may itself represent a new subfamily of serine proteases. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA detected a single 0.9-kilobase mRNA in the in vitro and in vivo variants of RNK-16 and in spleen-derived plastic-adherent rat lymphokine-activated killer cells. RNK-Met-1 mRNA was not detectable in freshly isolated rat splenocytes, thymocytes, brain, colon, and liver or activated nonadherent rat splenocytes and thymocytes.

Sequential glycosidase digestion of the O-glycans, with or without pretreatment by fucosidase or neuraminidase, revealed the following conclusions. 1) Leukosialin from HL-60 cells contains about 1-2 poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O-glycan chains/molecule. 2) About 50% of these poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O-glycans contain sialyl Le(x) termini, NeuNAc alpha 2-->3Gal beta 1-->4 (Fuc alpha 1-->3)GlcNAc beta 1-->R.

It has been previously shown that light-chain-deficient variants of the 38C cell line undergo 'secondary' light chain rearrangements. It is suggested, therefore, that complexes of mu and the 'surrogate' light chains omega and iota play a role in this process.

Eighteen percent of patients achieved complete response, 64% partial response, and 18% minor response with a median duration of 37.5, 22.9 and 3.5 months respectively. Twenty patients (45%), all partial or minor responders, subsequently had progression of the disease. The progression occurred more frequently in patients who presented at diagnosis with a hairy-cell index value > 0.50 than in those who presented with a hairy-cell index < 0.50: 14/26 (54%) versus 2/11 (18%) respectively. In addition, the progression rate was more evident in ""non-maintained"" than in ""maintained"" patients: 16/26 (61.5%) versus 4/18 (22%). Restarting alpha-IFN treatment in 16 of the 20 progressed patients proved effective only in 9 of them. From these findings it appears that a low hairy-cell index at diagnosis correlates favorably with a good hematological response.

We have measured the contribution of de-novo synthesis to the total acid-soluble uracil nucleotide pool in mouse tissues by analysis of the incorporation of label after intra-peritoneal infusion of L-[15N]alanine. The contribution of salvage synthesis was measured by the incorporation of radiolabel after intravenous infusion of [14C]uridine. The results show that de-novo synthesis makes the larger contribution to the intestine uracil nucleotide pool, salvage synthesis makes the larger contribution to the kidney pool, and de-novo and salvage synthesis make roughly equal contributions to the liver pool. In tumors studied (L1210, P388, B16, Nettesheim), the contribution of de-novo synthesis was at least five times the contribution of salvage synthesis. The measurements were repeated 24 hours after a 400-mg/kg dose of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartic acid. De-novo synthesis was substantially inhibited in all tissues and tumors after this treatment, although significant residual activity was observed in the intestine and L1210 cells.

Intracellular accumulation of MMC by sensitive (P388/S) and P388/R-84 cells was comparable. Despite a 32% reduction in NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase activity (responsible for MMC activation) in P388/R-84 cells, the rate of MMC bio-reduction by sensitive and resistant cells was similar. These results suggested that MMC resistance in P388/R-84 cell line must depend on factors other than impaired drug accumulation or bio-activation. Recent studies suggest that glutathione transferase (GST) dependent drug detoxification also contributes to cellular resistance of a variety of alkylating agents. Even though overexpression of GST has been noted in some MMC resistant tumor cells, it is not known if its level affects sensitivity to MMC. We have, therefore, determined the effect of ethacrynic acid (an inhibitor of GST activity) treatment on MMC cytotoxicity in P388/R-84 cells, which have about 2-fold higher GST activity than P388/S cells. The IC50 value for the inhibition of GST activity in vitro by ethacrynic acid (EA) was 16.5 microM (5 micrograms/ml). A depletion in intracellular GSH was also observed by treating P388/R-84 cells with EA alone or in combination with MMC. A non-toxic concentration of EA (1 microgram/ml; 3.3 microM) increased MMC cytotoxicity by 36% in P388/R-84 cells. MMC cytotoxicity was increased 2-fold by EA treatment in glutathione (GSH)-depleted P388/R-84 cells. These results suggest that GST mediated drug inactivation may represent another important mechanism of MMC resistance.","['Singh, S V', 'Xu, B H', 'Maurya, A K', 'Mian, A M']","['Singh SV', 'Xu BH', 'Maurya AK', 'Mian AM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Miami School of Medicine, FL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'M5DP350VZV (Ethacrynic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ethacrynic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/*pharmacology', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/17 00:00,1992/11/17 00:01,['1992/11/17 00:00'],"['1992/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1992 Nov 17;1137(3):257-63. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(92)90145-2.,,"['0167-4889(92)90145-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(92)90145-2 [doi]']",,,,,['CA 50638/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The PKC-alpha, -beta, -gamma, -delta, epsilon, and -zeta transcript levels were assessed by Northern blotting, and the PKC-alpha, -beta, and -gamma protein levels were examined by immunoblotting. The PMA-resistant cell variants HL-525 and HL-534 were found to be deficient in the PKC-beta isozyme RNA and protein as compared with the PMA-susceptible HL-60 and HL-205 cell lines. In addition, a ""delta-like"" PKC RNA species identified in these cells demonstrated a reduced abundance in the HL-525 and HL-534 cells. Southern blot analysis indicated that the observed reduction in PKC-beta gene expression does not appear to be due to a gross deletion or rearrangement of the gene. The expression of the early response genes junB, c-fos, and c-jun was attenuated in PMA-treated HL-525 and HL-534 cells as compared to the PMA-treated HL-60 and HL-205 cells.

The ERGB gene encodes for a 3.2-kilobase mRNA containing an open reading frame of 451 amino acids.

This differentiation is characterized by an increase in beta-globin gene expression that is followed by appearance of the hemoglobin. Phorbol-ester tumor promoters, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), inhibit differentiation of TPA-sensitive cells but not TPA-resistant cells. We have shown that the increase in beta-globin expression is inhibited by TPA in a TPA-sensitive clone but not in a TPA-resistant clone. To study the molecular mechanisms of regulation of gene expression by TPA, we examined the possible involvement of gene methylation and the TPA-responsive element (TRE). Both clones showed similar patterns of methylation around the beta-globin gene. Moreover, TPA-induced TRE binding and TRE enhancer activity were similar in both variants.

Colostrum and breast milk are considered major modes of transmission for many animal retroviruses as well as human T-cell leukemia virus, mainly as the consequence of ingestion of infected cells. Several cases that strongly suggest transmission of HIV-1 through breast-feeding have now been reported. In addition, recent evidence suggests that postpartum HIV-1 seroconversion of a mother may be associated with a high risk of postnatal transmission to offspring via breast milk. Preventive measures such as pasteurization of breast milk have not been fully examined. While the World Health Organization continues to promote breast-feeding in areas where no safe alternative exists, the Centers for Disease Control recommends that American women who are infected by HIV-1 not practice breast-feeding if a safe alternative is available. Large-scale, carefully controlled, prospective studies of the risk of HIV-1 infection associated with breast-feeding are of the utmost priority. Feasible and ethically acceptable feeding alternatives should be developed for countries where formula feeding has a strong negative effect on child morbidity and mortality.","['Van de Perre, P', 'Lepage, P', 'Homsy, J', 'Dabis, F']","['Van de Perre P', 'Lepage P', 'Homsy J', 'Dabis F']","['AIDS Reference Laboratory, Kigali, Rwanda.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['Animals', '*Breast Feeding', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/epidemiology/*transmission', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human/*microbiology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 1992 Sep;15(3):502-7. doi: 10.1093/clind/15.3.502.,,['10.1093/clind/15.3.502 [doi]'],,,85,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have investigated the regulatory effect of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a cytokine secreted by activated T cells, on the production and secretion of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) from macrophages in culture. The human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, was treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 h to induce macrophage differentiation and PDGF production, and then various doses of recombinant human IFN-gamma (0-1000 I.U./ml) were added to the culture. After 48 h, the conditioned medium and the cells were harvested and analyzed for PDGF production. PDGF-dependent mitogenic activity in the conditioned medium, estimated by neutralization of mitogenic activity with anti-PDGF antibody, was suppressed by IFN-gamma treatment. Radioimmunoassays for PDGF also revealed a decrease in both PDGF-AA and -BB in the conditioned medium with IFN-gamma treatment, whereas neither total cell DNA as an indication of cell number nor overall protein synthesis based on [3H]leucine incorporation were decreased. Northern analysis of total RNA extracted from the cells demonstrated that IFN-gamma suppressed the level of PDGF mRNA. Analysis of mRNA degradation in the presence of actinomycin D demonstrated that the decrease in PDGF mRNA was not due to enhanced degradation of mRNA. A similar inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma on PDGF mRNA levels was also found in monocyte-derived macrophages cultured in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. These results suggest that IFN-gamma modulates production and secretion of PDGF from macrophages and that the functions of macrophages in atherogenesis may be regulated by the cellular interactions between T cells and macrophages through the action of cytokines such as IFN-gamma.","['Kosaka, C', 'Masuda, J', 'Shimokado, K', 'Zen, K', 'Yokota, T', 'Sasaguri, T', 'Ogata, J']","['Kosaka C', 'Masuda J', 'Shimokado K', 'Zen K', 'Yokota T', 'Sasaguri T', 'Ogata J']","['National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,0242543,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Atherosclerosis. 1992 Nov;97(1):75-87. doi: 10.1016/0021-9150(92)90053-j.,,"['0021-9150(92)90053-J [pii]', '10.1016/0021-9150(92)90053-j [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite identical pretreatment protocols, a considerable difference in the level of resistance between L 1210 and Sa 180 tumors was noted (for doxorubicin: 45-fold versus 340-fold; for daunorubicin: 51-fold versus 275-fold). However, no difference in mdr 1 gene-amplification and the overexpression of mdr 1-RNA or P-glycoprotein was demonstrated. None of these parameters did increase by further treatment with a higher concentration of anthracyclines. Resistant sublines of Sa 180 revealed an overexpression of glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) in comparison to the parental line, whereas in sensitive and resistant sublines of L 1210 tumors the expression of GST-pi was similar. In order to study whether trifluoperazine can reverse the P-glycoprotein mediated component of multidrug resistance, trifluoperazine and doxorubicin were tested in vitro in L 1210 and Sa 180 cells. In contrast to the complete reversal of resistance in L 1210 tumors, resistance in Sa 180 was only partly circumvented. However, by buthionine sulfoximine treatment, the toxicity of multidrug resistant Sa 180 tumors could be increased. It was possible to reverse the resistance of Sa 180 tumors completely by trifluoperazine plus buthionine sulfoximine. Thus, multidrug-resistant Sa 180 tumors express different defense mechanisms whereas L 1210 tumors express only one defense mechanism (P-glycoprotein).","['Volm, M', 'Efferth, T', 'Mattern, J', 'Pommerenke, E W']","['Volm M', 'Efferth T', 'Mattern J', 'Pommerenke EW']","['Department of Experimental Pathology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arzneimittelforschung,Arzneimittel-Forschung,0372660,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Sarcoma 180/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arzneimittelforschung. 1992 Sep;42(9):1163-8.,,,,['mdrl'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Putrescine levels were increased 80-fold, and spermidine and spermine levels were greatly reduced after a 3-day exposure to a maximally inhibitory dose of 10 microM-AbeAdo. Addition of AbeAdo to the culture medium inhibited the growth of L1210 cells measured 3 days later in a dose-dependent manner, but, even at a dose of 10 microM, which was maximally effective, exposure to AbeAdo was not immediately cytostatic. However, the growth rate of L1210 cells chronically exposed to 10 microM-AbeAdo declined steadily until day 12, when the cells stopped growing. L1210 cells exposed to AbeAdo for 12 days could not be rescued from cytostasis by removal of the drug from the culture, but could be rescued by exposure to exogenous spermidine or spermine, indicating that the growth-inhibitory effects of AbeAdo were a result of spermidine and/or spermine depletion. It is suggested that elevated intracellular putrescine in AbeAdo-treated cells sustained limited growth in the absence of physiological levels of spermidine and spermine until certain critical and specific physiological role(s) fulfilled by spermidine (and/or spermine) became deficient resulting in cytostasis. N-(3-Aminopropyl)-1,4-diamino-cis-but-2-ene, a spermidine analogue that is a substrate for deoxyhypusine synthase, was able to mimic the effects of spermidine in reversing AbeAdo-induced cytostasis. Spermidine analogues such as 5,5-dimethylspermidine, which are not substrates for deoxyhypusine synthase, were not active in this way. These results provide evidence that the formation of hypusine in the protein-synthesis initiation factor eIF-5A may be a critical role of spermidine essential for cell growth.","['Byers, T L', 'Ganem, B', 'Pegg, A E']","['Byers TL', 'Ganem B', 'Pegg AE']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, M.S.

Such a variety of mutations may constitute variable clinical manifestations even in the simple mendelian disorders. On the other hand, pathogenesis of common diseases is much complicated and remains greatly to be elucidated. However, if we could use the strategies applied in the past few years for mendelian disorders, it seems to be not difficult to approach them. It is recommended to categorize a certain disease into subgroups for distinguishing their heterogenous phenotypes by clinical, biochemical and other properties. Owing to the success in making a subgroup (FAB classification), many subtype-specific translocations were found in leukemia, and then, rearrangement of relevant genes is also being shown. The best example is seen in chronic myelocytic leukemia. Since rearrangement of ABL and BCR was shown and both genes were cloned, detection of minimal residual diseases after intensive treatment became possible at 10(-6) level using RT-PCR technique. Recently developed interphase cytogenetics using FISH has visualized Ph1 translocation in metaphase cells and also in round nuclei, suggesting a potential use in monitoring the effect of certain drugs during treatment. Furthermore, very selective targeting therapy is being devised using antisense DNA.","['Abe, T', 'Inazawa, J', 'Yokota, S', 'Taniwaki, M']","['Abe T', 'Inazawa J', 'Yokota S', 'Taniwaki M']","['Dept. of Hygiene, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

These infected mice exhibit many of the viral and immunologic manifestations of AIDS. Bropirimine (2-amino-5-bromo-6-phenyl-4[3H]pyrimidinone, ABPP) is an immunomodulating compound which has been shown to inhibit other viral infections. Oral (per os treatment) dosages of ABPP ranging from 50 to 400 mg/kg/day for 3 days resulted in increased numbers of infectious centers in the infected mice and increased splenomegaly and percentage of Ig+ (B cells) in spleens of infected and uninfected mice. Decreased percentages of total Thy-1.2+ (total T) cells and L3T4+ (T-helper) cells were seen in both uninfected and infected mice and a slightly decreased percentage of Ly-2+ (T-suppressor/cytotoxic) cells was observed in spleens of the infected mice. No effect on Ly2+ cells in spleens of uninfected mice was found. Intraperitoneal injection, single or multiple, of 20-200 mg/kg ABPP prior to FV injection resulted in increased spleen weights but had no effect on numbers of infectious centers in the spleens or on FV antibody titers in the plasma. Intraperitoneal treatment of uninfected mice with ABPP resulted in slight or no changes in percentages of Thy-1.2+, L3T4+ and Ly-2+ cells. Mice receiving multiple exposures of ABPP had an increase in percentage of splenic B cells and a depressed response to the T cell mitogen PHA. Treatment with ABPP induced the production of interferon (IFN); however, a state of hyporesponsive IFN production was seen following multiple administrations of ABPP. These data suggest that the immunomodulator ABPP may have an enhancing effect on this retroviral disease.","['Warren, R P', 'Morrey, J D', 'Burger, R A', 'Okleberry, K M', 'Sidwell, R W']","['Warren RP', 'Morrey JD', 'Burger RA', 'Okleberry KM', 'Sidwell RW']","['AIDS Research Program, Utah State University, Logan 84322-6895.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Inducers)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'J57CTF25XJ (bropirimine)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Interferon Inducers/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 1992 Sep;19(3):233-45. doi: 10.1016/0166-3542(92)90082-g.,,"['0166-3542(92)90082-G [pii]', '10.1016/0166-3542(92)90082-g [doi]']",,,,,['N01-A1-72662/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-one patients with acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma entered the study upon the development of clinical signs of gram-negative sepsis and received the IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation every 6 h for 3 days (total dose, 1.3 liter with 7.8 g of IgM, 7.8 g of IgA, and 49.4 g of IgG), in addition to standardized antibiotic treatment. Concentrations of endotoxin and IgM and IgG antibodies against lipid A and Re lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in plasma were determined by a modified chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate test and semiquantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, before each immunoglobulin infusion and during the following 25 days. Seventeen patients were endotoxin positive; in five of these patients, gram-negative infection was confirmed by microbiologic findings. Prior to therapy, endotoxemia correlated significantly with the occurrence of fever, and a quantitative correlation between the endotoxin concentration and body temperature was found during the individual course of infection in 8 of the 17 patients. Overall mortality from endotoxin-positive sepsis was 41% (7 of 17) and 64% (7 of 11) in patients with symptoms of septic shock. Nonsurvivors had significantly higher maximum concentration of endotoxin in plasma compared with those of survivors at the first study day (median of 126 versus 34 pg/ml; P < 0.05) and during the whole septic episode (median of 126 versus 61 pg/ml; P < 0.05). In survivors, immunoglobulin therapy resulted in a significant decrease in endotoxin levels in plasma within the initial 18-h treatment period, from a pretreatment median value of 28 pg/ml to a value of 8 pg/ml (P< 0.05). In the seven patients who died from uncontrollable infection, no effect of therapy on endotoxin levels in plasma was observed. IgM and IgG antibodies against lipid A and Re LPS increased significantly under immunoglobulin treatment, with significant correlations between antibodies against lipid A and Re LPS. These data strongly suggest a prognostic significance of the endotoxin levels in plasma and a potential effect of treatment with a polyclonal IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation.

Although of different magnitude, the pattern of cytotoxic activity for the different cyclosporins alone closely parallelled that of L100 cells for U-1285, U1285/ADR and LO cells. The results indicate that not only the collateral sensitivity in classical MDR but also the cytotoxic actions of cyclosporins per se on tumor cells alone are independent of immunosuppressive activity. The results also suggest a structure-activity relationship for cyclosporin-induced cytotoxicity similar to, but independent of, MDR reversing activity.","['Larssson, R', 'Fridborg, H', 'Csoka, K', 'Bergh, J', 'Nygren, P']","['Larssson R', 'Fridborg H', 'Csoka K', 'Bergh J', 'Nygren P']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1992 Sep-Oct;12(5):1581-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heating at over 43 degrees C as a hyperthermia markedly suppressed enzyme activity of fetal type TK isozyme and number of S-phase cells labelled with BrdU, but not activities of adult type TK isozyme and TS.

The labeling index (LI), the duration of S-phase (Ts) and the total cell cycle time (Tc) were measured immediately. It was therefore possible to predict the next time when the single versus double labeled cells would re-enter the S-phase. In our study, the Tc was calculated to be 20 hours. The third label, tritiated thymidine (3HTdR), was introduced at the predicted time of 20 hours to confirm the validity of the previously calculated Tc. The actual percentage of cells which were labeled by (3HTdR) was very similar to the predicted value. We conclude, therefore, that the calculated cell cycle time correlated well with the actual cell cycle time, at least in a controlled in vitro culture system.

The growth-promoting effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (10 ng/ml) was inhibited appreciably by D3 and slightly by IFN-gamma. Despite the clear difference in their effects on growth of HL-60 cells, both IFN-gamma and GM-CSF in combination with D3 induced cell cycle changes, decreasing the number of cells in the S phase and increasing their percentage in the G1/0 phase. GM-CSF alone had no effect on differentiation, but enhanced differentiation induced by D3 distinctly though to a limited extent, and also enhanced monocytic differentiation, including morphological changes of HL-60 cells in the presence of D3 and IFN-gamma. GM-CSF as well as D3 and IFN-gamma induced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) production by the HL-60 cells, clearly indicating their importance in differentiation of these cells. IFN-gamma and GM-CSF had mutually potentiating effects and induced maximum IL-1 beta production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of D3. Thus despite its growth-promoting effect, GM-CSF is a potential inducer of monocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells, because in cooperation with IFN-gamma it induced monocyte-macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells in the presence of D3.","['Nakamaki, T', 'Kawakami, K', 'Sato, S', 'Hino, K', 'Tomoyasu, S', 'Tsuruoka, N', 'Honma, Y', 'Hozumi, M']","['Nakamaki T', 'Kawakami K', 'Sato S', 'Hino K', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Tsuruoka N', 'Honma Y', 'Hozumi M']","['Department of Hematology, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1992 Sep-Oct;12(5):1331-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies done after 1985, when TSP/HAM was first recognized, were identified by a computer search using MEDLARS II and CANCERLIT. Additional information was acquired from personal files and bibliographies of existing literature. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 400 articles, 90 book chapters, and 150 abstracts from meetings covering all aspects of HTLV-I and neurologic diseases were critically analyzed, and information from 250 publications was included. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: TSP/HAM is present in most HTLV-I endemic areas, with a prevalence ranging from 5.1 to 128 per 100,000 inhabitants. Up to 20% of patients develop TSP/HAM after transfusion of HTLV-I contaminated blood. Pathologic characteristics indicate a chronic meningomyelitis. The clinical features consist of a chronic progressive spastic paraparesis or paraplegia, sphincter disturbances, and minimal sensory loss. Supraspinal and peripheral nerve involvement is sometimes observed. High titers of HTLV-I-specific antibodies are present in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The high level of humoral and cellular immunologic response and the association of TSP/HAM with other immunologic diseases suggest an immune-mediated process. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressor treatment usually result in only short-term improvement. CONCLUSION: TSP/HAM is a common neurologic disease in many parts of the world. All patients with chronic progressive myelopathies should be tested for serum and cerebrospinal fluid HTLV-I-specific antibodies. Systematic screening of blood donors for HTLV-I is necessary to help prevent the dissemination of the virus and the occurrence of post-transfusional cases.","['Gessain, A', 'Gout, O']","['Gessain A', 'Gout O']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institues of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1992 Dec 1;117(11):933-46. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-117-11-933.,,['10.7326/0003-4819-117-11-933 [doi]'],,,255,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crude lysates prepared from cultured Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant or control baculoviruses are absorbed to nitrocellulose filters and used in a dot-immunobinding assay for screening hybridomas. The monoclonal antibody-producing hybridomas are derived by immunization of mice with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a hydrophilic region in the recombinant protein of interest. By using the baculovirus-produced recombinant protein as the screening antigen and by comparing antibody binding to filters containing control Sf9 lysates, hybridomas are identified that produce monoclonal antibodies with specific reactivity for the recombinant protein of interest and that can then subsequently be used to assist in the large-scale purification of the recombinant protein from baculovirus-infected cells. We applied this method to recombinant 26-kDa human Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2), an integral membrane oncoprotein that regulates programmed cell death (""apoptosis"") in hematolymphoid cells through unknown mechanisms.

Expression of the Id-SCL fusion gene in stably transfected K562 cells reproducibly resulted in nuclear segmentation and depressed growth rates; both of these phenotypic effects demonstrated a dosage dependence on the levels of Id-SCL mRNA and protein expressed in the various clones.

To investigate any potential human hazards from exposure to these chemicals, a case-control study of 59 lymphohematopoietic cancers was conducted within a cohort of male workers employed between 1943 and 1982 in eight North American styrene-butadiene rubber polymer-producing plants. A total of 193 controls were matched to the cases by plant, age, year of hire, duration worked, and survival to time of death of the case. Each job was assigned an estimated exposure rank, and each worker's cumulated rank score was calculated on the basis of the time spent in each job throughout his employment. ""Exposure"" as a dichotomous variable was defined as a log rank score above the mean of the log scores for the total population of cases and controls within a subtype of cancer. Matched-pair analysis identified a strong association between leukemia and butadiene, with an odds ratio of 9.36 (95% confidence interval 2.05-22.9) and an association between styrene and leukemia (odds ratio = 3.13, 95% confidence interval 0.84-11.2) that did not achieve statistical significance. When exposure to both styrene and butadiene was included in a conditional logistic regression model, the odds ratio for butadiene remained high (odds ratio = 7.39), but the estimated association of leukemia with styrene was small. The results of this study support the hypothesis that exposure to butadiene is associated with the risk of leukemia. There also appears to be an additional risk from work in specific subdivisions of the industry.","['Santos-Burgoa, C', 'Matanoski, G M', 'Zeger, S', 'Schwartz, L']","['Santos-Burgoa C', 'Matanoski GM', 'Zeger S', 'Schwartz L']","['Escuela de Salud Publica de Mexico, Cuernavaca, Morelos.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Styrenes)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Butadienes/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chemical Industry', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Regression Analysis', '*Rubber', 'Styrene', 'Styrenes/*adverse effects']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1992 Oct 1;136(7):843-54. doi: 10.1093/aje/136.7.843.,,['10.1093/aje/136.7.843 [doi]'],,,,,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 1993 Nov 1;138(9):765-8.

Mice immunized with a mixture of X-irradiated tumour cells (10(3)) and B30-MDP (100 micrograms) on 7 days prior to challenge by viable tumour cells displayed a significant decrease in metastasis towards the target organs, liver and spleen, compared with that of untreated mice. Immunization of mice with the mixture on day 5 or 7 after tumour challenge, when the level of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) in sera of mice inoculated with viable tumour cells was observed to be normal, caused less metastasis than immunization with X-irradiated tumour cells alone. Sensitization with X-irradiated tumour cells admixed with B30-MDP induced almost two times higher cytotoxicity of spleen cells against L5178Y-ML25 lymphoma cells than sensitization with X-irradiated tumour cells without B30-MDP. In contrast, cytotoxic activity of spleen cells against another target, L1210 lymphoma cells derived from BDF1 mice, was not observed by immunization with X-irradiated L5178Y-ML25 cells with or without B30-MDP. Specific lysis by splenic cells of the immunized mice against L5178Y-ML25 cells decreased to the normal level when T cells were deleted from the immunized spleen cells by the treatment of rabbit anti-mouse Thy1.2 antibody and rabbit complement. These results indicate that B30-MDP is able to augment a specific tumour immunity due to the enhancement of cytotoxicity mediated by T lymphocytes, and is useful as an immunopotentiating agent for active immunization of inactivated tumour cells.","['Yoo, Y C', 'Saiki, I', 'Sato, K', 'Azuma, I']","['Yoo YC', 'Saiki I', 'Sato K', 'Azuma I']","['Institute of Immunological Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '53678-77-6 (Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine)', '66880-80-6 (B 30-muramyl dipeptide)']",IM,"['Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine/*analogs & derivatives/immunology/pharmacology', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/secondary/therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/*therapeutic use']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 1992;10(11):792-7. doi: 10.1016/0264-410x(92)90515-l.,,"['0264-410X(92)90515-L [pii]', '10.1016/0264-410x(92)90515-l [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ultrastructural modifications of neoplastic cells in peripheral blood in a case of HCL were investigated before and 2 and 4 months after beginning treatment with human lymphoblastoid alpha-interferon. Before therapy, hairy cells displayed the typical cytoplasmic projections, and 4% contained ribosome-lamellae complexes (RLC) (the cells contained up to 7 RLC). Two months from the beginning of therapy, hairy cells had shorter projections, RLC had disappeared, and tubuloreticular structures (TRS) had appeared in 2.2% of the elements. Four months from the beginning of therapy, TRS persisted in 2.3% of hairy cells, cylindrical confronting cisternae (CCC) appeared in 6.8% of the cells, and uncommon RLC, in close contact with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane, were found in 1.5% of the elements. The cells contained up to 3 RLC. Our data confirm that interferon stimulates the synthesis of TRS and CCC, whereas the reappearance of uncommon forms of RLC could reflect their neosynthesis, possibly related to the interferon therapy. The frequent findings of a close contact between RLC and nuclear membrane support the view that RLC are derived not only from rough endoplasmic reticulum, but also from the nuclear membrane.","['Morroni, M', 'Ripa, G', 'Bolognesi, G', 'Leoni, P', 'Cinti, S']","['Morroni M', 'Ripa G', 'Bolognesi G', 'Leoni P', 'Cinti S']","['Istituto di Morfologia Umana Normale, Universita di Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Time Factors']",1992/06/30 00:00,1992/06/30 00:01,['1992/06/30 00:00'],"['1992/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tumori. 1992 Jun 30;78(3):190-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous transplant studies have demonstrated that higher doses of total-body irradiation result in less disease recurrence, but more toxicity. In this study, the possibility of delivering radiotherapy specifically to marrow using a radiolabeled anti-CD33 antibody (p67) was explored. Biodistribution studies were performed in nine patients using .05-.5 mg/kg p67 trace-labeled with 131I. In most patients initial specific uptake of 131I-p67 in the marrow was seen, but the half-life of the radiolabel in the marrow space was relatively brief, ranging from 9-41 hr, presumably due to modulation of the 131I-p67-CD33 complex with subsequent digestion and release of 131I from the marrow space. In four of nine patients these biodistribution studies demonstrated that with 131I-p67 marrow and spleen would receive more radiation than any normal nonhematopoietic organ, and therefore these four patients were treated with 110-330 mCi 131I conjugated to p67 followed by a standard transplant regimen of cyclophosphamide plus 12 Gy TBI. All four patients tolerated the procedure well and three of the four are alive in remission 195-477 days posttransplant. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a radiolabeled antimyeloid antibody as part of a marrow transplant preparative regimen and also highlights a major limitation of using conventionally labeled anti-CD33--namely, the short residence time in marrow. Strategies to overcome this limitation include the use of alternative labeling techniques or the selection of cell surface stable antigens as targets.","['Appelbaum, F R', 'Matthews, D C', 'Eary, J F', 'Badger, C C', 'Kellogg, M', 'Press, O W', 'Martin, P J', 'Fisher, D R', 'Nelp, W B', 'Thomas, E D']","['Appelbaum FR', 'Matthews DC', 'Eary JF', 'Badger CC', 'Kellogg M', 'Press OW', 'Martin PJ', 'Fisher DR', 'Nelp WB', 'Thomas ED', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', '*Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Time Factors']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1992 Nov;54(5):829-33. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199211000-00012.,,['10.1097/00007890-199211000-00012 [doi]'],,,,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

At 1 hr after exposure to the toxin (2.5 x 10(-7) M) deformation was detected, primarily in the mitochondria, followed by vacuolization in the cytoplasm and an increase in lysosome number at 2 hr post-intoxication. Thereafter, the endoplasmic reticulum assumed a microsomal-like appearance, the plasma membrane was disrupted and, finally, the cells released their content to the culture medium.

We have previously demonstrated that exposure to O3 in vitro results in increased accumulation and release of platelet activating factor (PAF) in the macrophage-like cell line HL60 differentiated with phorbol ester (dHL60). In the present study we have examined possible biochemical mechanisms responsible for the O3-induced increase in PAF levels in dHL60 cells. Specifically, we studied the effect of O3 on phospholipase A2 (PLA2), acetyltransferase, acetylhydrolase, and reacylation activities. dHL60 cells were exposed to 1.0 ppm O3 or air alone. O3 exposure was found to significantly decrease dHL60 cell acetylhydrolase activity by 36%. Additional experiments demonstrated that extracellular acetylhydrolase activity, but not intracellular acetylhydrolase activity, was inhibited by O3 exposure of dHL60 cells. O3 exposure resulted in a small (13%) but statistically significant reduction in reacylation activity in dHL60 cells. In addition, a significant (22%) contribution of PLA2 activation to the O3-induced increase in PAF levels was also found. Basal and calcium ionophore-induced acetyltransferase activity was found to be unaffected by exposure of dHL60 cells to O3. These data suggest that in vitro exposure to O3 affects both synthetic and degradative pathways of PAF metabolism in dHL60 cells.","['Samet, J M', 'Friedman, M']","['Samet JM', 'Friedman M']","['Center for Environmental Medicine and Lung Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '66H7ZZK23N (Ozone)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Ozone/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Platelet Activating Factor/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1992 Nov;117(1):19-25. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(92)90212-b.,,['10.1016/0041-008x(92)90212-b [doi]'],,,,,"['ES04951/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Because of this, the presentation and clinical course of PCP has become well-known to many physicians. However, PCP continues to occur among patients not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, generally those who receive immunosuppressive therapy as treatment for neoplastic disease. A review from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer has shown that a new group of patients, those receiving corticosteroid therapy for brain neoplasm, are also at risk for the development of PCP and should receive PCP prophylaxis. Previously defined patient groups--people with acute lymphocytic leukemia or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation--also should continue to receive prophylaxis. In addition, the clinical course and outcome of patients with neoplastic disease who develop PCP may differ from those with AIDS and PCP: the disease may be much more fulminant among patients with neoplastic disease, and the mortality rate much higher, approaching 50% in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center series. Wider use of prophylaxis should decrease the frequency of this disease, whereas prompt initiation of therapy in patients with a compatible syndrome should help to improve mortality rates.","['Sepkowitz, K A']",['Sepkowitz KA'],"['Infectious Disease Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Respir Infect,Seminars in respiratory infections,8700961,"['8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/therapeutic use']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Respir Infect. 1992 Jun;7(2):114-21.,,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results in this study indicate that the rate of DNA elution appears to be dependent upon the proximity of the DNA in relation to the replication complex. The rate of elution for DNA analyzed immediately after a 30-min labeling period with [14C]thymidine was about five times slower than the rate of elution for bulk-labeled DNA. However, the rate was increased a few hours later when the recently replicated DNA had matured and was likely to be farther from replication-associated attachment sites on the nuclear protein matrix. About one cell cycle after pulse labeling, when the labeled DNA was replicated again, DNA underwent similar changes in elution rate. For the four cell lines examined here, the elution rate 3-4 h after pulse labeling correlated with cellular radiosensitivity. Changes in rate of elution caused by altering EDTA concentration or pH may also be explained by DNA structural changes which occur during lysis. We conclude that the neutral filter elution method is sensitive to differences in chromatin organization which may also play a role in cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation.","['Wlodek, D', 'Olive, P L']","['Wlodek D', 'Olive PL']","['British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Chromatin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/drug effects/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/biosynthesis/*radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1992 Nov;132(2):242-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model is found to provide an adequate description of solid cancer incidence and also, to a lesser extent, of that of leukemia as a function of radiation dose when up to two radiation-affected stages are assumed. For non-leukemias the optimal model is one in which there are two radiation-affected stages separated by two additional stages. In the case of leukemia one radiation-affected stage or two adjacent stages provide suitable fits. There appear to be significant differences between the optimal models fitted to each cohort, although there is no heterogeneity within the Japanese data set by sex, by cancer type, or by age at exposure. Low-dose and low-dose-rate population risks for a population having the cancer and overall mortality rates of the current UK population are calculated on the basis of the optimal models fitted to the Japanese data to be about 8.3 x 10(-2) excess cancer deaths person-1 Sv-1, 10.1 x 10(-2) radiation-induced cancer deaths person-1 Sv-1, or 1.40 years of life lost person-1 Sv-1. Risks for a population having the mortality rates of the current Japanese population are about 6.5 x 10(-2) excess cancer deaths person-1 Sv-1, 7.8 x 10(-2) radiation-induced cancer deaths person-1 Sv-1, or 0.89 years of life lost person-1 Sv-1. It is a feature of the Armitage-Doll model, and other multistage models of carcinogenesis, that if radiation acts at more than one stage then (inverse) dose-rate effects may arise as a result of interactions between the effects of a protracted dose at the various radiation-affected stages. However, it is shown in this paper that these three measures of cancer risk in general display fairly slight dependence on administered dose in the range 0.001 to 1.0 Sv and on the length of the time over which the dose is administered in the range 1 to 100 years. Dose-rate effects resulting from the protraction of a radiation exposure over many years acting on (the same) cells at various stages of a multistep process of carcinogenesis are therefore expected to be slight. Dose-rate effects which have been observed in epidemiological studies and cellular radiobiology may thus find their explanation in other phenomena such as short-term intracellular repair.","['Little, M P', 'Hawkins, M M', 'Charles, M W', 'Hildreth, N G']","['Little MP', 'Hawkins MM', 'Charles MW', 'Hildreth NG']","['Environmental Technology Branch, Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories, Glos, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Mathematics', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'New York', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk Factors', 'Thymus Gland/*radiation effects', 'Tinea Capitis/epidemiology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1992 Nov;132(2):207-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Radiat Res. 1994 Jan;137(1):124-8.

To understand the signaling mechanisms of such cytokines, we have proposed a two-chain interleukin (IL) 6 receptor model: IL-6 triggers the association of a ligand-binding chain (IL-6 receptor) and a nonbinding signal transducer (gp130) to form a high-affinity receptor complex, resulting in transmission of the signal by the cytoplasmic portion of gp130. This model would explain the functional redundancy of cytokines if we were to assume that gp130 interacts with several different receptor chains. Here we present data indicating that gp130 functions as a common signal transducer for IL-6, oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor. We show that anti-gp130 monoclonal antibodies completely block the biological responses induced by all of these factors. Since leukemia inhibitory factor functions as a cholinergic differentiation factor in nerve cells, as does ciliary neurotrophic factor, these results suggest that gp130 may also play a role in the nervous system.","['Taga, T', 'Narazaki, M', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Saito, T', 'Miki, D', 'Hamaguchi, M', 'Davis, S', 'Shoyab, M', 'Yancopoulos, G D', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Taga T', 'Narazaki M', 'Yasukawa K', 'Saito T', 'Miki D', 'Hamaguchi M', 'Davis S', 'Shoyab M', 'Yancopoulos GD', 'Kishimoto T']","['Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Fibrinogen/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Recombinant Proteins/drug effects/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 15;89(22):10998-1001. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.22.10998.,,['10.1073/pnas.89.22.10998 [doi]'],,,,PMC50470,,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 515 amino acids with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. The characteristics of [3H]serotonin accumulation by CV-1 cells expressing the cDNA clone suggested sequestration by an intracellular compartment. In cells permeabilized with digitonin, uptake was ATP dependent with an apparent Km of 1.3 microM. Uptake was abolished by the proton-translocating ionophore carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and with tri-(n-butyl)tin, an inhibitor of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. The rank order of potency to inhibit uptake was reserpine > tetrabenazine > serotonin > dopamine > norepinephrine > epinephrine. Direct comparison of [3H]monoamine uptake indicated that serotonin was the preferred substrate. Photolabeling of membranes prepared from CV-1 cells expressing MAT with 7-azido-8-[125I]iodoketanserin revealed a predominant tetrabenazine-sensitive photolabeled glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 75 kDa. The mRNA that encodes MAT was present specifically in monoamine-containing cells of the locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, and raphe nucleus of rat brain, each of which expresses a unique plasma membrane reuptake transporter. The MAT cDNA clone defines a vesicular monoamine transporter representing a distinct class of neurotransmitter transport molecules.","['Erickson, J D', 'Eiden, L E', 'Hoffman, B J']","['Erickson JD', 'Eiden LE', 'Hoffman BJ']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Slc18a2 protein, rat)', '0 (Vesicular Biogenic Amine Transport Proteins)', '0 (Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins)', '136769-36-3 (azidoiodoketanserin)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '8B1QWR724A (Reserpine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '97F9DE4CT4 (Ketanserin)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Azides/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromaffin Granules/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Dopamine/*metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Glycoproteins/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Ketanserin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neuropeptides', 'Norepinephrine/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reserpine/*pharmacology', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular Biogenic Amine Transport Proteins', 'Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 15;89(22):10993-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.22.10993.,,['10.1073/pnas.89.22.10993 [doi]'],['GENBANK/L00603'],,,PMC50469,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that proteins in HL-60 cells were labeled by 17 beta-[3H]estradiol (E2), [3H]progesterone (Pg), 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy[3H]vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], [125I]triiodothyronine (T3), [125I]thyroxine (T4), and [3H]prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). All of these hormones, except PGE2, are ligands of the steroid hormone receptor family. Addition to the growth medium of 5 microM ketoconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes, increased about 2-fold the labeling of proteins by T3, T4, 1,25(OH)2D3, and PGE2. In contrast, ketoconazole did not change markedly the extent of labeling by RA, E2, or Pg. Alkaline methanolysis, which cleaves ester bonds, released variable percentages of the radioactive ligands bound to protein. These values were about 80% for RA and PGE2; 50% for T3, T4, and Pg; and 20% for E2 and 1,25(OH)2D3. Treatment with thioether-cleavage reagents, iodomethane or Raney nickel catalyst, released < 2% of the covalently bound ligands. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of labeled proteins were unique for each ligand. Proteins of M(r) 47,000 and 51,000 were labeled by RA, E2, T3, and T4. These proteins had the same mobilities as RI and RII, the cAMP-binding regulatory subunits of type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinases. 1,25(OH)2D3 also bound to proteins of M(r) 47,000 and 51,000. However, these proteins had pI values different from those of RI or RII. These results suggest that some activities of ligands of the steroid hormone receptor family and of PGE2 may be mediated by their covalent modification of proteins.","['Takahashi, N', 'Breitman, T R']","['Takahashi N', 'Breitman TR']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Estradiol/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Ketoconazole/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Progesterone/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism', 'Thyroxine/*metabolism', 'Triiodothyronine/*metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 15;89(22):10807-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.22.10807.,,['10.1073/pnas.89.22.10807 [doi]'],,,,PMC50431,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptor disengagement leads to dephosphorylation of beta and gamma chains via the action of undefined phosphatases. Here we have identified five distinct polypeptides associated with the high-affinity IgE-receptor tetrameric complex, which apparently become phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in sequence with the beta and gamma chains. Like beta chain, polypeptides pp180, pp48, pp42, and pp28 are phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine, whereas pp125 is only phosphorylated on serine. The phosphorylation of each of these receptor-associated polypeptides is antigen-dose dependent and is restricted to activated receptor complexes. Furthermore the physical association between pp125 and the receptor is quantitatively affected by receptor phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, indicating a coupling-uncoupling mechanism. Finally, in vitro kinase experiments show that activated receptor complexes are also physically associated with tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases as part of a larger complex containing the phosphorylated polypeptides.","['Paolini, R', 'Numerof, R', 'Kinet, J P']","['Paolini R', 'Numerof R', 'Kinet JP']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20852.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 15;89(22):10733-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.22.10733.,,['10.1073/pnas.89.22.10733 [doi]'],,,,PMC50416,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyze the chromatin structure of the LCR during early hematopoietic differentiation using nontransformed, multipotential, growth factor-dependent, murine hematopoietic progenitor cells. We show that LCR hypersensitive sites characteristic of erythroid cells are present in three independent multilineage progenitors [FDCP (factor-dependent cell, Paterson)-mix A4, B6SUtA, and LyD9] under conditions of self-renewal. Induction of differentiation down a nonerythroid pathway causes a progressive loss of hypersensitivity in the LCR.

A subclone derived from the MDS cells behaves like the parent cells when transfected or infected with HIV-1. In contrast to other T-cell lines, neither phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate nor tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulated the replication of HIV-1, whereas bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate or interferon alpha caused 50% and 80% inhibition of reverse transcriptase production, respectively.

Alternatively, cells preincubated with cryo-solution followed by suspension in fetal calf serum without cryo-additive were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for the production of cryo-sections. Indirect immunofluorescence and alkaline phosphatase--antialkaline phosphatase based immunoreactions were performed for the decoration of various surface antigens with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. All immunoreactions were repeated at least three times and the stored cell preparations were investigated after different periods of storage (up to four months). The immunoreactions of fresh cells in suspension (which were used as controls) were comparable with those of cryopreserved cells, e.g. cells on smears after thawing and on cryo-sections of cell pellets. The strongest immunoreactions were achieved on fixed cryo-sections. The maintenance of cell morphology of smears from cryopreserved cells was slightly better than of cells from cryo-sections. In our hands the preparation of cell pellets, which are suitable for the storage in liquid nitrogen and the production of cryosections, is a very useful method for immunocytochemical investigations of cytological specimens especially in situations where immunoreactions cannot be performed on fresh material.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dinges, H P', 'Schmid, C', 'Zatloukal, K', 'Mair, S', 'Preisegger, K H', 'Redl, H']","['Dinges HP', 'Schmid C', 'Zatloukal K', 'Mair S', 'Preisegger KH', 'Redl H']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Graz School of Medicine, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,['EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)'],IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', '*Cryopreservation', '*Cytological Techniques', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Frozen Sections', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/chemistry', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1992 Aug;188(6):714-21. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80167-6.,,"['S0344-0338(11)80167-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80167-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of blasts phenotype with monoclonal antibodies confirm the occurrence of leukemias different from the normally programmed cellular line. Deviations of leukemic cells phenotype may be explained with the fact that leukemogenesis is not an absolute block of cells differentiation but combines maturation disorders and proliferation enabling expression normally absent antigens. It confirms the concept of line preservation and presentation of ""earlier frozen"" phenotype, and explains the occurrence of leukemias in which blasts present phenotype of one line which does not comply with cell differentiation pattern.

All the viruses retained an intact tyrosine kinase domain and were competent for transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in culture. One series contained 12-bp linker insertions in the regions flanking the kinase domain, and the other contained frameshift mutations that truncated the gene product downstream of the kinase domain. The majority of the 12-bp insertion mutants retained full bone marrow-transforming activity; only one insertion in the SH2 domain showed reduced activity.

All provirus-positive reconstituted mice were found to develop hematopoietic proliferative disorders and, in certain cases, overt leukemia--myeloblastic, myelomonocytic and T lymphocytic. In all cases expression of v-myc was high and the disease type did not correlate with the level of expression. We have isolated immortalized monocytes, myeloid progenitors and T lymphocytes from several of these mice and shown tumorigenicity in secondary syngeneic recipients.

METHODS: Fifteen children aged 3-11 years were studied. Seven had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, two acute myeloid leukaemia, two lymphoma and four had other tumours. Ondansetron 5 mg/m2 IV or 4 mg by mouth was given immediately before chemotherapy or radiation treatment and continued eight hourly for 24 hours. Nausea and vomiting was assessed during treatment and for the next 48 hours, and graded using WHO criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-eight courses of chemotherapy were assessed, 27 severely emetogenic and 11 moderately emetogenic. Two included total body irradiation. The most severe nausea and vomiting was grade 2 (transient vomiting) reported in six children. Nausea and vomiting was abolished on subsequent courses in four of these children by increasing the ondansetron dose frequency to six hourly. The remaining children experienced no nausea or vomiting (n = 7) or only nausea (n = 2). Nausea and vomiting were each completely controlled in 27 courses. CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron is a cost effective and safe antiemetic in children receiving chemotherapy and total body irradiation, minimises weight loss on treatment and enables outpatient chemotherapy in some cases.","['Sullivan, M J', 'Abbott, G D', 'Robinson, B A']","['Sullivan MJ', 'Abbott GD', 'Robinson BA']","['Department of Paediatrics, Christchurch School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,N Z Med J,The New Zealand medical journal,0401067,['4AF302ESOS (Ondansetron)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Nausea/etiology/prevention & control', 'Ondansetron/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/prevention & control', 'Vomiting/etiology/*prevention & control']",1992/09/23 00:00,1992/09/23 00:01,['1992/09/23 00:00'],"['1992/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Z Med J. 1992 Sep 23;105(942):369-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTX-resistant MOLT-3 cell lines, MOLT-3/MTX200 and MOLT-3/MTX10,000, were cross-resistant to CB3717; however, the degree of resistance was only tenfold for both cell lines, and increased dihydrofolate reductase activity in MOLT-3/MTX10,000 had little influence on the degree of CB3717 resistance. The MOLT-3 cell line made resistant to TMQ, MOLT-3/TMQ200, was as sensitive to CB3717 as the parent line. The cell growth inhibitory effect of CB3717 on MOLT-3 was reversed by the addition of thymidine. Leucovorin also partially reversed CB3717-induced growth inhibition. Cellular uptake of MTX and 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate was hindered by the presence of a high concentration of CB3717, whereas TMQ uptake was not influenced by CB3717. CB3717 appears to enter the cells not only through reduced folate transport system, but by other route(s). CB3717 does not share the transport pathway with TMQ. Our observations that MTX-resistant cells with increased dihydrofolate reductase are not more resistant than cells without increased enzyme activity, and that TMQ-resistant cells are not cross-resistant to CB3717, may have clinical relevance.","['Takemura, Y', 'Ohnuma, T']","['Takemura Y', 'Ohnuma T']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine (CUNY), NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mt Sinai J Med,"The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",0241032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Trimetrexate/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mt Sinai J Med. 1992 Oct;59(5):419-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These specific assays also may prove to be extremely useful in the detection of acquired drug resistance and for new analog drug development. In a general sense, this type of assay may eventually also be useful for guiding and selecting treatment for individual patients with other drugs with known mechanisms of action. Knowledge of the basis of tumor resistance is essential to develop new approaches to treatment, such as the use of other folate analogs that may still be effective, and to devise ways in which to selectively inhibit tumor cell growth using new analogs (trimetrexate) and leucovorin.","['Bertino, J R', 'Li, W W', 'Lin, J', 'Trippett, T', 'Goker, E', 'Schweitzer, B', 'Banerjee, D']","['Bertino JR', 'Li WW', 'Lin J', 'Trippett T', 'Goker E', 'Schweitzer B', 'Banerjee D']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Department of Medicine, Memorial Hospital, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Mt Sinai J Med,"The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",0241032,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mt Sinai J Med. 1992 Oct;59(5):391-5.,,,,,34,,"['CA 08010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47997/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The activity of the more recently developed classes of antifolates directed against thymidylate synthase and de novo purine synthesis is sufficiently dependent on polyglutamation that these compounds should be specifically cytotoxic to any normal or malignant proliferating cell expressing this enzyme. We have studied the patterns of expression of FPGS in mammalian cells and tissues during rapid growth, growth arrest, differentiation, and embryonic development. During embryogenesis in the rat, FPGS levels in liver and brain were higher during the period of proliferative activity and then dropped to a level characteristic of the adult organs. However, the levels in liver were substantially higher than those in brain at any given time. This pattern was mimicked in mouse C3H 10T1/2 embryo fibroblast cells, in which FPGS activity decreased after cessation of growth but then remained at a lower steady state level during an extended period of postconfluent culture. Enzyme activity also dropped after the differentiation of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. In a human homolog of these experimental systems, FPGS levels were below the limits of detection in circulating mature human hematopoietic cells of the granulocytic, lymphoblastic, and erythrocytic lineages. In striking contrast, substantial levels of FPGS were found in circulating lymphoblasts from eight patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The levels of FPGS found in these transformed stem cells would help to explain the sensitivity of many acute lymphoblastic leukemias to folate antimetabolites.

The cause(s) of human leukemia remains unknown. Bone marrow (BM) is believed to be the site of origin of human leukemias, although the specific locus(i) and/or cell(s) from which it arises have not been definitively identified. Generally, human leukemias and related proliferative diseases are thought to be clonal in nature; affecting a single hematopoietic stem cell, which then proliferates and replaces the marrow of normal hematopoietic stem cell systems. The condition is believed to be malignant in nature. Results of our current morphologic studies on well-fixed, ideally-stained thin sections of plastic-embedded bone marrow biopsies (BMB) from a large number of acute (AML, ALL) and chronic (CGL, CLL) leukemia patients suggest that human leukemias may not be clonal diseases. Instead, a large population of other resident cells--'endosteal cells'--appears to become involved in the process and it is possible that all members of this group enter the activity simultaneously. This change (transformation) in the endosteal cell population might be due to an abnormality (qualitative or quantitative) of diffusable, humoral factors (yet to be identified) that are responsible for the growth and proliferation of these hematopoietic precursor cells. In this context, the human leukemias may be considered not as malignant, but rather the result of an aberration of factor(s) that control hematopoiesis. In this respect, the human leukemias, particularly AML, ALL and CML, might be analogous to pernicious anemia (megaloblastic anemia) as it was understood 40-50 years ago.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Islam, A']",['Islam A'],"['Division of Hematologic Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 1992 Sep;39(1):110-8. doi: 10.1016/0306-9877(92)90149-7.,,"['0306-9877(92)90149-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(92)90149-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in a disturbance of the delicate balance between proliferation and differentiation and constitute a major step towards cell transformation.

Meanwhile these studies have increased our knowledge of normal cell proliferation and differentiation and provided us with new tools for diagnosis and for developing more specifically targeted treatment. An example would be the production of antibodies that recognize specifically the new chimeric proteins. Oncogenesis is a complex and multiple step process that proceeds by acquisition of successive genetic insults. The different steps do not necessarily occurs following a predetermined order, although some secondary changes are preferentially induced by a given first mutation. In leukemia, sequential changes in karyotype are well documented but molecular makers for tumor progression have not yet been systematically investigated. This is one of our many challenges for the future.","['Hagemeijer, A']",['Hagemeijer A'],"['Dept. of Cell Biology and Genetics, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Oncogenes']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6 Suppl 4:16-8.,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,

These technological advances have included the development of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) reactive with surface antigens on leukemic cells which can help confirm the lineage and diagnosis of acute leukemia. More importantly, MoAb in conjunction with morphology and cytochemical stains have led to the identification of FAB-MO and the more common recognition of FAB-M7. MoAbs have also helped define prognostic groups, e.g., T-cell leukemia, mature B-cell leukemia, and rare groups such as CD7+ AML. However, the greatest advances in our understanding of acute leukemia has occurred with the application of genetic techniques. Disregulation of genes responsible for normal growth and differentiation initiates the molecular events that lead to the transformation and proliferation of cells recognized clinically as leukemia. Non-random cytogenetic abnormalities apparently contribute to this gene disregulation and specific abnormalities are associated with clinically important subgroups. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the t(9;22), t(1;19), and t(4;11) appear to have a poor prognosis. In acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), -7/7q-;-5/5q-, 11q23 abnormalities have poor outcomes while t(15;17) and in some series t(9;11), t(8;21), and inv(16) have a good response to therapy. Molecular studies of somatic cell (immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor) gene rearrangements have assisted in the diagnosis and classification of ALL. The application of the polymerase chain reaction technique to specific gene rearrangements has provided a useful approach to minimal residual disease. Specific gene activation (N-myc, evi-1) or fusion genes such as the alpha retinoic acid receptor (alpha RAR) and pml have been identified as the specific cause of some cases of leukemia. The cloning of specific chromosomal breakpoints identified in leukemia (as has been done for CML) will result in specific probes which can be used to make the diagnosis rapidly at the molecular level. Because of the tremendous number of recent developments, this paper will focus only on major developments that will soon have a clinical impact.","['Mirro, J Jr']",['Mirro J Jr'],"[""Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, PA 15213-2583.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Phenotype']",1992/11/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/11/11 19:15'],"['1992/11/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/11/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6 Suppl 4:13-5.,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,

For detection of specific cytogenetic aberrations these problems can be overcome with non-radioactive in situ hybridization (ISH). ISH may especially be applied for the detection of trisomy 12, which is the most frequent cytogenetic aberration in CLL. Sixty-seven patients with CLL, four normal controls and one lymphoblastoid B-cell line with a trisomy 12 were studied using a chromosome 12 specific probe. To determine the hybridization properties of the CLL cells, all samples were also hybridized with probes specific for chromosomes 1 and 8. All leukemias were analyzed by immunocytochemistry to determine the proportion of tumor cells. Eight cases (11%) showed a trisomy 12. After correction for the number of tumor cells, it was demonstrated that in almost all cases (7 out of 8), the aberration was present in a proportion of the tumor cells (between 30 and 72%).

This confirmed the unique nature of these rearrangements. However, contrary to the hypothesis that the CDR III is produced by a random process of rearrangement, biased utilisation of diversity (D) segments and of joining (J) regions 4, 5 and 6 was demonstrated. Moreover, preferred sequence boundaries were seen in J regions 1 to 5 and were suggested at the 3'-end of certain D regions, notably D21/9 and DK1. Similar patterns of rearrangement have been noted in normal B-lymphocyte clones. Together with relatively limited N nucleotide addition, these factors may restrict the potential sequence variability at the D-N-J junction. The occurrence of clonal progression by secondary gene rearrangements, such as V-V replacement, favours the use of this site when designing clone-specific oligonucleotide probes for use in monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD).

These data suggest a possible new explanation of the synergism of HDMTX and 6-thiopurines, for example 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine, since plasma Hx is considered to counteract 6-thiopurine toxicity through competition at the level of HGPRT.","['Hashimoto, H', 'Kubota, M', 'Shimizu, T', 'Kasai, Y', 'Sano, H', 'Adachi, S', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Mikawa, H']","['Hashimoto H', 'Kubota M', 'Shimizu T', 'Kasai Y', 'Sano H', 'Adachi S', 'Akiyama Y', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/*blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Uridine/*blood']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6(11):1199-202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The radiation-induced L4415 leukemia is characterized as a relatively slowly growing, non-immunogenic, immature T-cell leukemia which shows a reproducible growth pattern upon intravenous (i.v.) transfer. Survival time following i.v. inoculation is inversely related to the number of leukemic cells in the inoculum, which allows a quantitative estimate in terms of log leukemic cell kill of the effect of treatment. The first signs of leukemic growth are found in the bone marrow, the spleen, and the liver. Leukemic cells can be detected in the peripheral blood 13 days after inoculation. Due to replacement of normal hemopoietic tissue by leukemic cells and their number increasing exponentially thereafter, normal hemopoiesis is inhibited in the later stages of the disease as indicated by severe thrombocytopenia and anemia. Death is caused by a combination of splenic rupture, gastrointestinal and pulmonary hemorrhage, and impaired functions of heavily infiltrated organs. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are prominent features at autopsy. Cyclophosphamide- and radiosensitivity of the clonogenic leukemic cells have been determined, a 2.9 log cell kill could be induced by single dose cyclophosphamide inoculation and a dosage giving a surviving fraction of 0.37 (D0) of 0.99 Gy with an extrapolation number (N) of 8.5 were calculated. Based on these data, the L4415 rat leukemia may be regarded as a relevant model for human acute lymphocytic leukemia and may thus serve to explore new treatment strategies.","['Kloosterman, T C', 'Tielemans, M J', 'Martens, A C', 'Hoogerbrugge, P M', 'van Bekkum, D W', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Kloosterman TC', 'Tielemans MJ', 'Martens AC', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'van Bekkum DW', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Institute of Applied Radiobiology and Immunology TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Liver/pathology', 'Organ Size', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6(11):1161-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the expression of the cytokines interleukin 1-beta (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) as well as of the ribonuclease activator 2-5 AS in the presence and absence of IFN in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blast cells from 26 patients. Before monocyte and T-cell depletion there was no expression of IL-1, IL-6 or GM-CSF, and only three of 13 patients studied expressed TNF mRNA. After cell depletion one or more cytokine was expressed in 31-62% of the 26 patients. Expression of one or more mRNA for IL-1, IL-6, GM-CSF and TNF after 18 h incubation was detected in 16 of 26 patients (63%) and this was particularly so in French-American-British (FAB) subtypes M4 and M5. Eight of nine patients with IL-6 mRNA expression and seven of 10 with IL-1 mRNA expression were in the FAB subtypes M4 and M5. Twenty-two of 26 patients showed induction of 2-5 AS mRNA in response to IFN in vitro. Exposure to IFN resulted in reduction of IL-1 mRNA in nine of 12 cases, of IL-6 mRNA in eight of nine, and GM-CSF mRNA in five of seven cases. TNF mRNA was unaffected by IFN despite 2-5 AS induction in 12 of 13 patients expressing this cytokine. In the presence of exogenous IFN, cells from six of seven patients studied showed inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA. DNA synthesis could also be abrogated in six of seven patients with anti-IL-1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and in two of seven with anti-IL-6 MoAb. This inhibitory effect could be reversed in all patients when anti-IL-1 or anti-IL-6 was given in combination with their corresponding cytokine. These data suggest that IFN may exert a therapeutic effect in a proportion of AML patients by blocking IL-1 and IL-6 mediated growth, consequent on activation of the ribonuclease activator 2-5 AS.","['Sissolak, G', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Mehta, A B', 'Ganeshaguru, K']","['Sissolak G', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Mehta AB', 'Ganeshaguru K']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*genetics"", 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6(11):1155-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have found that such an activity is produced, both in normal and AML LTMC, by an adherent, nonfibroblastic cell population (most likely macrophages), and also by blast cells developed in AML LTMC. The presence of the inhibitory activity correlated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the culture supernatants. Part of the activity (30%) produced in rhCSF-1-treated normal LTMC was neutralized in colony assays by anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody. In contrast, the soluble inhibitory activity from AML LTMC was completely neutralized by anti-TNF alpha. However, addition of anti-TNF alpha (every 72 h, from day 0 to 21, at 125 ng/ml) to AML LTMC resulted in only partial neutralization of the inhibitory activity, indicating that production of TNF alpha is just one of the mechanisms by which normal hemopoiesis is inhibited in AML LTMC, and that other factors are involved in this process. In keeping with this idea, we found very high levels of prostaglandin E, a hemopoietic inhibitor, in the supernatant of cultures that contained the soluble inhibitory activity. Interestingly, rhCSF-1 showed opposite effects on TNF production in normal (up-regulation) and AML (down-regulation) LTMC, which suggests the presence of functionally abnormal, leukemia-derived macrophages in AML LTMC.","['Mayani, H', 'Guilbert, L J', 'Sych, I', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A']","['Mayani H', 'Guilbert LJ', 'Sych I', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins E/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6(11):1148-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five of these cell lines, HEL, U-937, HL-60, K-562, and KU-812 were treated with phorbol myristic acetate to induce differentiation. Under these conditions the expression of the serglycin gene was modulated compared to the non-induced cells. HL-60, K-562, and KU-812 were also induced with dimethyl sulfoxide and retinoic acid; variations in serglycin transcript level were also observed. The present investigation establishes, at the nucleic acid level, the ability of various cells mimicking different stages in the developmental pathways of the haemopoietic lineage to synthesize proteoglycans belonging to the serglycin family.

In order to determine the effects of these peptides on malignant cells, we analyzed the expression and function of insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II receptors on B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL) cell lines, utilizing competitive binding, affinity crosslinking, and cell proliferation assays. The BCP ALL cells bound to each peptide with mean specific binding for 125I-insulin, 125I-IGF-I, and 125I-IGF-II of 19.6%, 7.1%, and 4.3% of radioligand added, respectively. Competitive binding to intact cells demonstrated that 125I-IGF-I was displaced by IGF-I = IGF-II >> insulin, 125I-IGF-II was displaced by IGF-II > insulin = IGF-I, and 125I-insulin was displaced by insulin >> IGF-II > IGF-I. These data were remarkable for the potency of IGF-II displacement of 125I-IGF-I and 125I-insulin. Affinity crosslinking of radioligands to SUP-B2 cell membranes demonstrated the high affinity insulin and IGF-I (type 1 IGF) receptors. IGF binding proteins were also present in BCP ALL cell membrane preparations. In the cell proliferation studies, insulin stimulated a 50-130% increase in leukemic cell growth with a half-maximal concentration of 0.1-3.0 ng/ml in three BCP ALL cell lines. The proliferative response to insulin was blocked by the addition of an insulin receptor antibody. However, no response was observed with IGF-I, and IGF-II was only weakly mitogenic with a proliferative response noted at 100 ng/ml. Thus, while BCP ALL cells possess receptors for insulin and IGF-I, only the insulin receptor mediated a proliferative response.","['Neely, E K', 'Rosenfeld, R G', 'Illescas, A', 'Smith, S D']","['Neely EK', 'Rosenfeld RG', 'Illescas A', 'Smith SD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, Somatomedin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Somatomedins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Insulin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Insulin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Somatomedin/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Somatomedins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6(11):1134-42.,,,,,,,"['CA 42106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 07217/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 28229/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Up to 16 different cytotoxic drugs were routinely tested, but neither asparaginase nor methotrexate produced dose-response related cell kill. FMCA data showed good correlation to the well established Disc assay and the drug sensitivity reported by the FMCA was in good agreement with known clinical activity. Samples from children and initial ALL tended to be more drug sensitive than those from adults and ALL at relapse, respectively. For 36 samples clinical outcome was correlated to the quartile position in comparison to all other samples for the most in vitro active drug actually given to the patient.

The translocation event creates on the Philadelphia chromosome a fusion between two genes: bcr and abl. Depending on the localization of the breakpoint in the bcr gene different chimeric bcr-abl genes are generated, each encoding their own tumor-specific protein: e1-a2P190bcr-abl, b2-a2p210bcr-abl, or b3-a2P210bcr-abl. Especially in ALL, the presence of such a tumor-specific protein is highly associated with a poor prognosis. Detection of these proteins therefore has a strong clinical significance. In this study a polyclonal antiserum, termed BP-2, was raised against a synthetic peptide, corresponding to the tumor-specific 'fusion-point' epitope of the b3-a2P210bcr-abl protein. The specificity of BP-2 for the bcr-abl joining region in b3-a2P210bcr-abl is demonstrated by means of peptide inhibition studies in combination with immunoprecipitation.

The total dose of bimolane ranged from 40 to 400 g (mean dose 194 g). The interval between the initiation of bimolane therapy and the diagnosis of leukemia was 12-96 months (median 30 months).

Recently, controversy has emerged regarding the expression of bcl-2 in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and its correlation with lymphocyte proliferation. Using immunohistochemical methods, Pezzella et al. (Pezzella F, Tse G, Cordell J, Pulford K, Gatter K, Mason D. Am J Pathol 1990; 137:225-32) detected abundant amounts of Bcl-2 protein in resting PBLs and observed an inverse correlation between bcl-2 expression and cellular proliferation in lymphoid tissues. In contrast, previous in vitro studies of bcl-2 mRNAs showed that expression of this gene is very low in unstimulated PBLs but can be markedly induced when lymphocytes are stimulated to proliferate in culture (Reed JC, Tsujimoto Y, Alpers JD, Croce CM, Nowell PC. Science 1987; 236:1295-9; Granniger W, Seto M, Boutain B, Goldman P, Korsmeyer S. J Clin Invest 1987; 80:1512-5). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To resolve this issue, the regulation of p26-Bcl-2 protein levels was examined in freshly isolated and in cultured human PBLs by immunoblotting using two different polyclonal antisera specific for the human Bcl-2 protein. RESULTS: When freshly isolated from whole blood, resting PBLs contained easily detectable amounts of p26-Bcl-2 protein that did not significantly change in culture when cellular proliferation was stimulated with mitogenic lectins and lymphokines. If processing of the blood was delayed, however, p26-Bcl-2 protein was low or undetectable in resting PBLs and underwent marked increases in its relative levels after in vitro stimulation of PBLs by mitogenic lectins and lymphokines. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that bcl-2 is normally expressed in quiescent circulating lymphocytes, consistent with a role for this gene in the maintenance of lymphocyte survival, and illustrate the importance of correlating in vitro and in vivo expression data.","['Reed, J C', 'Miyashita, T', 'Cuddy, M', 'Cho, D']","['Reed JC', 'Miyashita T', 'Cuddy M', 'Cho D']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blood Specimen Collection', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*blood', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Time Factors']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 1992 Oct;67(4):443-9.,,,,,,,['CA-47956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This model would explain the functional redundancy of cytokines if we were to assume that gp130 interacts with several different receptor chains. Here we present data indicating that gp130 functions as a common signal transducer for IL-6, oncostatin M (OM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). We show that anti-gp130 monoclonal antibodies completely block the biological responses induced by all of these factors. Since LIF functions as a cholinergic differentiation factor in nerve cells as does CNTF, these results suggest that gp130 may also play a role in the neural system.","['Taga, T']",['Taga T'],"['Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

At that time, the bone marrow revealed 4.6% blasts. On March 5, after one course of chemotherapy, she was transferred to our hospital for radiotherapy. Hematological findings were WBC 10,100/microliter with 10% blasts, Hb 10.9 g/dl, platelet 3.7 x 10(4)/microliters. Bone marrow aspiration was unsuccessful. The blasts in the peripheral blood were negative for peroxidase and chloroacetate esterase; but positive for naphtylbutyrate esterase. The leukemic cells were positive for CD13, CD33, and had phagocytic activity. Chromosomal analysis revealed 46XX with Ph1 chromosome and some additional anomalies. Southern blot analysis of tumor cells shows BCR rearrangement. These findings suggest that the blasts were immature monocytic cells, and we conclude that this is a rare case of extramedullary monoblastic crisis of CML.","['Harigae, H', 'Nomura, J', 'Furuyama, K', 'Shishido, T', 'Okuda, M', 'Sato, A', 'Sugawara, T', 'Endo, K', 'Yoshinaga, K', 'Ichinohasama, R']","['Harigae H', 'Nomura J', 'Furuyama K', 'Shishido T', 'Okuda M', 'Sato A', 'Sugawara T', 'Endo K', 'Yoshinaga K', 'Ichinohasama R', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Tohoku University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Ribs/pathology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1992 Jun;33(6):806-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now identified a transformed cell line (NIH 3T3/DTras) which efficiently forms syncytia when exposed to Mo-MuLV, yet is low pH dependent for Mo-MuLV entry. Treatment of NIH 3T3/DTras cells with chloroquine, an agent which raises endosomal pH, blocks Mo-MuLV entry, but not Mo-MuLV-induced syncytium formation. This demonstrates that fusion which accompanies viral entry and fusion which is responsible for syncytium formation occur as independent processes in these cells. In addition, we determined that neither inherent differences in the Mo-MuLV receptor nor reduced affinity for Mo-MuLV gp70 can account for resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to Mo-MuLV-induced syncytium formation.","['Wilson, C A', 'Marsh, J W', 'Eiden, M V']","['Wilson CA', 'Marsh JW', 'Eiden MV']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chiroptera', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Giant Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hylobates', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/physiology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Dec;66(12):7262-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.12.7262-7269.1992.,,['10.1128/JVI.66.12.7262-7269.1992 [doi]'],,,,PMC240430,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that the U3 long terminal repeat region of its genome is responsible for this block (E. Rassart, Y. Paquette, and P. Jolicoeur, J. Virol. 62:3840-3848, 1988). By using hybrids of permissive and resistant cells infected with BL/VL3 RadLV or fibrotropic MuLV, we found that the resistant phenotype was dominant. Investigation to determine at which step of the virus cycle the block operates revealed that integration, transcription, and translation of the BL/VL3 viral genome occurred at normal levels in nonpermissive cells. The BL/VL3 RadLV Pr65gag proteins made in nonpermissive cells were also myristylated and located at the membrane, and the levels of their cleaved products were similar to those of fibrotropic MuLV. However, processing of BL/VL3 RadLV Pr85env was impaired in nonpermissive cells. Virions were not released into the culture medium of nonpermissive cells, as measured by reverse transcriptase activity and by content in p30 or gp70 protein and as documented by lower levels of budding particles seen by electron microscopy. These results indicate that BL/VL3 RadLV replication is blocked at a late stage of the virus cycle, i.e., at virion assembly. Interestingly, these BL/VL3 RadLV-infected nonpermissive fibroblasts were resistant to superinfection by fibrotropic Moloney MuLV, and this resistance also occurred at a late step of the Moloney virus cycle. Since this block is dominant, it appears that the U3 long terminal repeat region of the BL/VL3 viral genome has the ability to induce a cellular suppressor factor(s), thus bringing intracellular immunity against itself and against other ecotropic MuLVs.","['Gorska-Flipot, I', 'Huang, M', 'Cantin, M', 'Rassart, E', 'Masse, G', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Gorska-Flipot I', 'Huang M', 'Cantin M', 'Rassart E', 'Masse G', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Myristic Acids)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Mice', 'Myristic Acid', 'Myristic Acids/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proviruses/genetics/immunology', 'Radiation Leukemia Virus/*genetics/*immunology', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection', 'Virus Integration']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Dec;66(12):7201-10. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.12.7201-7210.1992.,,['10.1128/JVI.66.12.7201-7210.1992 [doi]'],,['gag'],,PMC240418,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Patients with ras mutation-positive AML had a higher frequency (six of 10 patients) of working 5 or more years in an a priori high-risk occupation than did patients with ras mutation-negative AML (eight of 52; odds ratio [OR] = 6.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-36). Patients with ras mutation-positive AML were more likely than patients with ras mutation-negative AML to have breathed chemical vapor on the job (OR = 9.1; 95% CI = 1.3-64) or to have had skin contact with chemicals (OR = 6.9; 95% CI = 1.3-37). When ras-positive patients were compared with healthy control subjects, the ORs for occupation and occupational exposures remained elevated, while patients with ras mutation-negative AML showed no increased risk when compared with control subjects. CONCLUSION: Activation of ras proto-oncogenes may identify an etiologic subgroup of AML caused by occupation and chemical exposure. IMPLICATION: Disease etiology may be better understood if epidemiologic measures of exposure are integrated with molecular assays of the genetic defects responsible for cancer initiation and promotion.","['Taylor, J A', 'Sandler, D P', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Shore, D L', 'Ball, E D', 'Neubauer, A', 'McIntyre, O R', 'Liu, E']","['Taylor JA', 'Sandler DP', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Shore DL', 'Ball ED', 'Neubauer A', 'McIntyre OR', 'Liu E']","['Environmental and Molecular Epidemiology Section, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, N.C. 27709.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Codon)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Codon/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, ras/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Occupational Exposure']",1992/11/04 00:00,1992/11/04 00:01,['1992/11/04 00:00'],"['1992/11/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/04 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Nov 4;84(21):1626-32. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.21.1626.,,['10.1093/jnci/84.21.1626 [doi]'],,"['H-ras', 'HRAS', 'K-ras', 'KRAS', 'N-ras', 'NRAS']",,,"['CA-31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Nov 4;84(21):1614-5.

Reduction of the nitro group of the 5-nitropyridines containing an alcohol in the side chain to the corresponding 5-aminopyridines increased biological activity. Preliminary studies showed that the 5-nitropyridine oximes were considerably less potent than the pyridopyrazines as antimitotic agents and that the former are apparently not converted to the latter in vivo.

The aim of this paper was to describe the Unit's methods for the investigation of health around point sources of environmental pollution in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: Routine data currently including deaths and cancer registrations are held in a large national database which uses a post code based retrieval system to locate cases geographically and link them to the underlying census enumeration districts, and hence to their populations at risk. Main outcome measures were comparison of observed/expected ratios (based on national rates) within bands delineated by concentric circles around point sources of environmental pollution located anywhere in Britain. MAIN RESULTS: The system is illustrated by a study of mortality from mesothelioma and asbestosis near the Plymouth naval dockyards during 1981-87. Within a 3 km radius of the docks the mortality rate for mesothelioma was higher than the national rate by a factor of 8.4, and that for asbestosis was higher by a factor of 13.6. CONCLUSIONS: SAHSU is a new national facility which is rapidly able to provide rates of mortality and cancer incidence for arbitrary circles drawn around any point in Britain. The example around Plymouth of mesothelioma and asbestosis demonstrates the ability of the system to detect an unusual excess of disease in a small locality, although in this case the findings are likely to be related to occupational rather than environmental exposure.","['Elliott, P', 'Westlake, A J', 'Hills, M', 'Kleinschmidt, I', 'Rodrigues, L', 'McGale, P', 'Marshall, K', 'Rose, G']","['Elliott P', 'Westlake AJ', 'Hills M', 'Kleinschmidt I', 'Rodrigues L', 'McGale P', 'Marshall K', 'Rose G']","['Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Department of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Asbestosis/mortality', 'Data Collection', 'Environmental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Environmental Pollution/*statistics & numerical data', '*Health Status', '*Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Mesothelioma/mortality', 'Microcomputers', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Small-Area Analysis', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1992 Aug;46(4):345-9. doi: 10.1136/jech.46.4.345.,,['10.1136/jech.46.4.345 [doi]'],,,,PMC1059597,,,,,,,,,,,

All three variants were IFN-reactive with regard to induction of 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase activity and were similarly sensitive to the growth-inhibiting action of IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor. Responsiveness to the antiproliferative effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), however, was confined to cell lines U937 and U937-VR. Although expressing a comparable number of GM-CSF receptors, the highly IFN-sensitive variant U937-V was refractory to GM-CSF. Flow cytometry revealed a marked difference in the expression of the antigen CD11b which was detectable on 85% of cells of the U937-V line but only on approximately 25% of cells derived from the U937 and U937-VR lines.

While Daudi cells were inhibited in proliferation and in total protein synthesis, no effect was seen on JOK-1 cells. However, high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that four polypeptides were induced in JOK-1 cells after IFN-alpha incubation, while an additional 11 were induced and two down-regulated in Daudi cells. Kinetic studies revealed that the changes in JOK-1 cells were only temporary (within 8-16 h) and small to moderate in magnitude (less than four-fold). In Daudi cells, the changes for two of these polypeptides were early (within 2 h), for most of them prolonged (at least 24 h), and for three of them of great magnitude (between 6- and 30-fold). Quantitative analytical assessments indicated that four IFN-alpha-inducible polypeptides, present in low amounts of untreated cells, were highly expressed only in sensitive Daudi cells upon IFN-alpha treatment. This observation might indicate a role for these polypeptides in the inhibition of cell proliferation in Daudi cells.

Under our experimental conditions, Daudi cells were less sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of IFN than previously reported by other authors, and ST8246 cells were insensitive to this antiproliferative effect. In contrast, IgM production was profoundly affected in both cell lines. Thus, we could discriminate between the effect on cell growth from the effect on the immune response. Using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, mu chains and monomeric and pentameric IgM were distinguished from cytosolic and membrane-associated fractions and from culture medium (extracellular IgM). Pentameric extracellular IgM and monomeric membrane IgM were diminished by HuIFN-alpha(ly) treatment, respectively, in ST8246 cells and in Daudi cells.

Tumor-free and L1210 leukemia-bearing female B6D2F1 mice were treated with zinc before administration of the alkylating agent nitrogen mustard. Protocols for administration route and frequency as well as the chemical formulation of the zinc were varied. The effect of a phytate-free diet was studied.

METHODS: Mean lymphocyte volume and lymphocyte distribution width were measured on each patient (n = 90) using a hard copy of an amplified LVDA histogram. The mean lymphocyte volume was taken as the mean of the values on either side of the peak at half maximum height. The lymphocyte distribution width was taken as the range of cell values between the two values used to calibrate the mean lymphocyte volume. A template showing typical histograms from commonly occurring CLPD was also produced on an acetate sheet. This was used to examine the histogram from each new patient to evaluate its usefulness as an alternative to the calculation of mean lymphocyte volume and lymphocyte distribution width. RESULTS: Mean lymphocyte volume and lymphocyte distribution width were significantly higher in B cell lymphocytic leukaemia of mixed cell type (B CLL/PL), B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with peripheral blood spill, hairy cell leukaemia and T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia than in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B CLL). The mean lymphocyte volume, but not the lymphocyte distribution width, was also significantly higher in T cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia than in B CLL. The template gave an immediate preliminary indication of possible subtype(s) of disorder and could be used as an alternative to measurement of mean lymphocyte volume and lymphocyte distribution width. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic haematology analysers producing an LVDA provide a useful, cost effective cell sizing analysis which can aid the differentiation of subtypes of CLPD.","['Alexander, H D', 'Markey, G M', 'Nolan, R L', 'Morris, T C']","['Alexander HD', 'Markey GM', 'Nolan RL', 'Morris TC']","['Department of Haematology, Belfast City Hospital, Northern Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Cell Size', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Sezary Syndrome/pathology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1992 Oct;45(10):875-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.45.10.875.,,['10.1136/jcp.45.10.875 [doi]'],,,,PMC495057,,,,,,,,,,,

In view of the importance of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in cellular growth and differentiation we have investigated protein phosphorylation in these cells following exposure to bistratene A, using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Marked increases in the phosphorylation of a protein of 20 kDa, pl 6.7, and a basic protein of 25 kDa were observed after incubation with bistratene A. A comparison was made with cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and bryostatin 5. While changes in phosphorylation patterns were observed with these two compounds, the 20 kDa and 25 kDa proteins did not undergo phosphorylation changes. The 20 kDa protein was induced rapidly by very low concentrations of bistratene A reaching near maximal levels with 10 nM at 15 min exposure. This protein was found to be localised to the cytoplasm. Phosphoaminoacid analysis demonstrated that the majority of 32P was present in serine and tyrosine residues. The increased phosphorylation of the 20 kDa protein appeared to be due to hyperphosphorylation of existing protein although there was some increase in the amount of the protein.

Maximally stimulating concentrations of LIF (25 ng/ml), IL-11 (10 ng/ml), or IL-6 alone (10 ng/ml) promoted an 81, 157, and 153% increase, respectively, in acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity in murine serum-free cultures compared with controls (n = 5).

Flow cytometric analysis of 4-day-old cultures showed that LIF alone had minimal effect on megakaryocytic ploidy, whereas IL-11 and IL-6 alone markedly augmented high ploidy cells. Enumeration of cells stained for AchE showed that IL-11 increased the numbers of Mks in comparison to LIF, IL-6 or controls by up to 59%. Moreover, a twofold increment in Mk number was noted when IL-11 was used in combination with IL-3 (compared with either IL-3 alone of IL-3+IL-6). Flow cytometric ploidy analysis of 8-day-old human liquid marrow cultures showed that either LIF, IL-11, or IL-6 alone markedly augmented the percentage of 32N cells compared with cultures containing only human IL-3. The data suggest that LIF and IL-11 promote murine and human Mk maturation in vitro, although the effect of IL-11 exceeds that of LIF in mice. Despite the comparable influence of IL-11 and IL-6 on Mk ploidy, IL-11 has the additional characteristic of enhancing the number of Mks, particularly in combination with IL-3.","['Burstein, S A', 'Mei, R L', 'Henthorn, J', 'Friese, P', 'Turner, K']","['Burstein SA', 'Mei RL', 'Henthorn J', 'Friese P', 'Turner K']","['Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City 73190.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Ploidies']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 Nov;153(2):305-12. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041530210.,,['10.1002/jcp.1041530210 [doi]'],,,,,['HL29037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

K562/S cells were made resistant to MTX by soft-agar cloning either in RPMI-1640 medium (K562/MTX-PGA) or in folic-acid-free RPMI-1640 medium containing 10 nM leucovorin (K562/MTX-LV). The optimal concentrations of leucovorin for the growth of K562/S, K562/MTX-PGA and K562/MTX-LV cells were 1 nM, 5 nM and 10 nM respectively. K562/MTX-PGA cells were 24-fold resistant to MTX as noted by impaired MTX transport. In contrast, K562/MTX-LV cells were 26-fold resistant to MTX as noted by gene amplification of dihydrofolate reductase. Furthermore cross-resistance to cytosine arabinoside was only demonstrated in K562/MTX-PGA, while the K562/MTX-LV cells showed no significant cross-resistance to cytosine arabinoside. These results suggest that the type and level of folates used during the development of MTX resistance may play a role in the mechanism for MTX resistance.

Accordingly, expression of mouse ecoR cDNA in mink CCL64 fibroblasts yields cells (CEN cells) that have y+ transporter activity above the endogenous background and that bind and are infected by ecotropic MuLVs. The effect of ecotropic MuLV infection on expression of y+ transporter was analyzed in mouse and in mink CEN fibroblasts. Chronic infection with ecotropic MuLVs caused 50-70% loss (down-modulation) of mouse y+ transporter in plasma membranes, detected as a reduced Vmax for uptake and outflow of L-[3H]arginine with no effect on Km values. Down-modulation was specific for mouse y+ and did not affect other transporters or the endogenous mink y+, suggesting that it results from specific interaction between mouse y+ and the viral envelope glycoprotein gp70 in the infected cells. Because this partial loss of mouse y+ from cell surfaces is insufficient to explain the complete interference to superinfection that occurs in cells chronically infected with ecotropic MuLVs, alternative explanations for interference are proposed. In contrast to the y+ down-modulation caused by chronic infection, binding of extracellular envelope glycoprotein gp70 at 37 degrees C resulted in noncompetitive inhibition of amino acid import by mouse y+ but had no effect on export through this same transporter or on any transporter properties of mink y+. The effects of gp70 on transport kinetics suggest that it slows the rate-limiting step of the amino acid import cycle, a conformational transition of the empty transporter in which the binding site moves from the inside back to the outside of the cell, and that gp70 has no effect on the rate-limiting step of the amino acid export cycle. Infected cells retain substantial y+ activity. Moreover, the virus binding site on ecoR is in a mobile region that changes conformation during the amino acid transport cycle.","['Wang, H', 'Dechant, E', 'Kavanaugh, M', 'North, R A', 'Kabat, D']","['Wang H', 'Dechant E', 'Kavanaugh M', 'North RA', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '6KA95X0IVO (Homoserine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Homoserine/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lysine/pharmacology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Models, Biological', 'Proline/pharmacology', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Sodium/pharmacology']",1992/11/25 00:00,1992/11/25 00:01,['1992/11/25 00:00'],"['1992/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 25;267(33):23617-24.,,['S0021-9258(18)35883-6 [pii]'],,,,,"['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DA03160/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In addition, HL-60 was differentiated into monocytic lineage by exogenous GM3 and into granulocytoid by NeuAc-nLc. In the present report, the enzymatic bases of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in HL-60 during differentiation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and all-trans-retinoic acid were investigated. The following results were of particular interest. (i) Lactosylceramide alpha 2-->3 sialyltransferase (GM3 synthase) was remarkably up-regulated during monocyte differentiation, while the GM3 synthase level did not change in granulocytic differentiation. (ii) By contrast, lactosylceramide beta 1-->3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Lc3Cer synthase) was down-regulated during monocytic differentiation, while the activity of Lc3Cer synthase was found to increase in granulocytic differentiation. (iii) The activities of four downstream glycosyltransferases (for synthesis of NeuAc-nLc) were found to increase or to remain unchanged during monocytic and granulocytic differentiation. These results strongly suggested the following. The dramatic GM3 increase and the decrease of NeuAc-nLc during monocytic differentiation are the consequences of the up-regulation of GM3 synthase and the down-regulation of Lc3Cer synthase, although the downstream enzymes are ready to catalyze their enzyme reactions. The notable increase of NeuAc-nLc and the relative decrease of GM3 during granulocytic differentiation are the results of the unchanged level of GM3 synthase and the up-regulation of Lc3Cer synthase together with the activation of the downstream glycosyltransferases. These results suggest that these two key upstream glycosyltransferases, GM3 synthase and Lc3Cer synthase, play critical roles in regulating the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in HL-60 cells during differentiation. This switching mechanism of these two glycosyltransferases, together with our previous findings, might be one of the most important parts of the determining system of differentiation direction in human myeloid cells into monocytic or granulocytic lineages.","['Nakamura, M', 'Tsunoda, A', 'Sakoe, K', 'Gu, J', 'Nishikawa, A', 'Taniguchi, N', 'Saito, M']","['Nakamura M', 'Tsunoda A', 'Sakoe K', 'Gu J', 'Nishikawa A', 'Taniguchi N', 'Saito M']","['Division of Hemopoiesis, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.206 (lactosylceramide 1,3-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.4 (beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gangliosides/biosynthesis', 'Glycosphingolipids/*biosynthesis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/analysis/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Sialyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/25 00:00,1992/11/25 00:01,['1992/11/25 00:00'],"['1992/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 25;267(33):23507-14.,,['S0021-9258(18)35868-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactions with fatty acids and its use in monitoring free fatty acids.,23495-501,"The fatty acid-binding protein from rat intestine (I-FABP) has been covalently modified with the fluorescent compound Acrylodan. Acrylodan was found to label Lys27, one of the few amino acid residues found by x-ray diffraction studies to change orientation upon fatty acid (FA) binding to I-FABP. Binding of FA to this Acrylodan-modified I-FABP (ADIFAB) induces a large shift in fluorescence emission wavelength from 432 to 505 nm. As a consequence, the ratio of emission intensities provides a direct measure of the concentration of FA bound to the protein. Binding of FA is well described by single site equilibrium for FA concentrations below the critical micelle concentration. ADIFAB dissociation constants (Kd) determined at 37 degrees C and at concentrations below the critical micelle concentration for oleate, palmitate, linoleate, arachidonate, and linolenate were, respectively, 0.28, 0.33, 0.97, 1.6, and 2.5 microM. The variation of these Kd values with FA molecular species is highly correlated with the solubility of the FA in water, suggesting that all these FA bind with a similar conformation in the I-FABP binding site. The ADIFAB response together with the measured equilibrium constants allows a direct determination of the concentration of long chain free fatty acid (FFA) in the concentration range, depending upon the FA molecular species, between 1 nM and > 20 microM. As an example of its use as a probe to measure FFA levels, ADIFAB is used here to monitor the time course for FFA release from IgE receptor- and ionomycin-activated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells.","['Richieri, G V', 'Ogata, R T', 'Kleinfeld, A M']","['Richieri GV', 'Ogata RT', 'Kleinfeld AM']","['Division of Membrane Biology, Medical Biology Inst., La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fabp7 protein, rat)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 7)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '86636-92-2 (acrylodan)', 'CKR7XL41N4 (2-Naphthylamine)']",IM,"['2-Naphthylamine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 7', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*analysis/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Library', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Micelles', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Substrate Specificity']",1992/11/25 00:00,1992/11/25 00:01,['1992/11/25 00:00'],"['1992/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 25;267(33):23495-501.,,['S0021-9258(18)35866-6 [pii]'],,,,,"['GM29831/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM44171/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

L., Patrone, M., Marks, P. A., and Rifkind, R. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18414-18418). The present studies assess the effect of HMBA on the content of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG), the physiologic activator of PKC, in MELC variants. Exposure of parental Sc9 cells to HMBA induced a rapid rise and fall in DG content. The DG level increased within seconds from 225 pmol.10(6) cells-1 to a maximum of 305 pmol.10(6) cells-1 at 5 min. Thereafter, DG content fell reaching control levels at 30 min and 46% of control at 4 h. Similar DG elevations were detected in HMBA-resistant, phorbol ester-resistant, and vincristine-resistant MELC lines. Early DG elevation was followed by the characteristic rapid fall in both the phorbol ester-resistant and vincristine-resistant lines, both of which differentiate rapidly in response to HMBA. In contrast, in an HMBA-resistant MELC the DG level failed to fall for at least 10 h. Selection of HMBA-resistant cells for vincristine resistance restores both HMBA sensitivity and the rapid fall in DG content. Addition of a synthetic DG, 1-oleyl-2-acetyl glycerol (OAG), along with HMBA and every 2 h for the next 48 h blocked differentiation, as measured by accumulation of benzidine-reactive cells or by the commitment assay in methyl-cellulose. However, if addition of OAG was delayed for just a few minutes, until endogenous DG levels began to fall, differentiation was no longer inhibited. Rapid elevation of DG content is the earliest reported event during HMBA action and a subsequent fall in the DG content appears to be a critical step in the process of commitment to terminal differentiation.","['Michaeli, J', 'Busquets, X', 'Orlow, I', 'Younes, A', 'Colomer, D', 'Marks, P A', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Kolesnick, R N']","['Michaeli J', 'Busquets X', 'Orlow I', 'Younes A', 'Colomer D', 'Marks PA', 'Rifkind RA', 'Kolesnick RN']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Diglycerides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Genetic Variation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1992/11/25 00:00,1992/11/25 00:01,['1992/11/25 00:00'],"['1992/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 25;267(33):23463-6.,,['S0021-9258(18)35859-9 [pii]'],,,,,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

H., Czajkowski, C. A., and Angeles, S. M. (1991) Cancer Res. 51, 3420-3426) described a K562 human erythroleukemia line (K562.4CF), characterized by an elevated uptake capacity for methotrexate (MTX) and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and the identification of a highly glycosylated membrane transporter (GP-MTX) by radioaffinity labeling with N-hydroxysuccinimide [3H] methotrexate. In the present study, radioaffinity-labeled GP-MTX from K562.4CF cells was isolated by Ricinus communis agglutinin I-agarose affinity chromatography, coupled with gel filtration and preparative electrophoresis. Antiserum to the purified, radio-labeled protein was raised in a rabbit and screened by immunoblot analysis of K562.4CF plasma membrane proteins or purified GP-MTX. The antiserum detected a broad GP-MTX band centered at 92 kDa on 7.5% gels. On 4-10% gels, the apparent molecular mass for GP-MTX shifted to 99 kDa. Antiserum specificity was established by quantitatively converting the immunoreactive glycoprotein in plasma membrane homogenates to its N- and O-deglycosylated forms with N- and O-glycanases, respectively. Whereas the methotrexate uptake capacity of K562.4CF cells was elevated 6.1-fold over parental cells, the GP-MTX content on immunoblots was increased approximately 3-fold. For two methotrexate-resistant K562 lines (33- and 70-fold), decreased drug uptake (28 and 18% of parental levels) closely correlated with their reduced GP-MTX contents. A GP-MTX isoform was also detected on immunoblots of membrane proteins from CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia cells. With a transport-impaired CCRF-CEM line (13% of wild type uptake), an aberrant electrophoretic migration for GP-MTX was observed, establishing the presence of structural modifications in the transport protein. These structural differences were independent of carrier glycosylation since they were detected following the glycosidase treatments. These findings implicate important roles for distinct carrier-specific alterations in the expression of diminished drug transport in methotrexate-resistant human tumor cells.","['Matherly, L H', 'Angeles, S M', 'Czajkowski, C A']","['Matherly LH', 'Angeles SM', 'Czajkowski CA']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '43ZWB253H4 (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', '*ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Antibodies', 'Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 15;267(32):23253-60.,,['S0021-9258(18)50084-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The products of reactions catalyzed by DNA pol alpha in vitro were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels to measure insertion of araCMP, extension from an araCMP 3' terminus, and binding of the enzyme to an araCMP 3' terminus. The results show that insertion of araCMP opposite dGMP in the DNA template is about 3-fold less efficient than insertion of dCMP. Extension from an araCMP 3' terminus by addition of the next complementary nucleotide is approximately 2000-fold less efficient than extension from a correctly base-paired 3' terminus. In the absence of the second substrate, dNTP, DNA pol alpha binds with approximately equal affinities to DNA templates that contain oligonucleotide primers with araCMP or dCMP positioned at the 3' terminus. In the presence of dNTP, the enzyme extends the araCMP 3' terminus or dissociates, but it is not trapped at the araCMP 3' terminus in a nonproductive ternary complex as is observed at the ddCMP 3' terminus. To determine if slow phosphodiester bond formation contributes to the observed extension rate from the araCMP 3' terminus by DNA pol alpha, oligonucleotide primers with araCMP positioned at the 3' terminus were elongated by addition of the alpha-phosphorothioate analogue of the next complementary nucleotide. The rate of extension from araCMP by addition of 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-phosphorothioate (dAMP alpha S) was 6-fold slower than by addition of dAMP, indicating that bond formation is partially rate limiting in the extension reaction. Thus, inefficient extension from the araCMP 3' terminus is the major determinant contributing to the low incorporation frequency of araCMP into DNA by DNA pol alpha, and this inefficiency can be attributed, in part, to slower phosphodiester bond formation at the araCMP 3' terminus.","['Perrino, F W', 'Mekosh, H L']","['Perrino FW', 'Mekosh HL']","['Department of Biochemistry, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', ""7075-11-8 (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-monophosphate)"", '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'F469818O25 (Cytidine Monophosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Arabinonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cytidine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Polymerase II/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Templates, Genetic']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 15;267(32):23043-51.,,['S0021-9258(18)50053-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When Friend murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are cultured in medium containing lovastatin, the precursor of murine leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein (gPr90env) fails to undergo proteolytic processing, which normally occurs in the Golgi complex. Consequently, newly synthesized envelope proteins are not incorporated into viral particles that are shed into the culture medium. gPr90env appears to be localized in a pre-Golgi membrane compartment, based on its enrichment in subcellular fractions containing NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity and the sensitivity of its carbohydrate chains to digestion with endoglycosidase H. Arrest of gPr90env processing occurs at concentrations of lovastatin that are not cytostatic, and the effect of the inhibitor is prevented by addition of mevalonate to the medium. The low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins, rab1p and rab6p, which are believed to function in early steps of the exocytic pathway, are normally modified posttranslationally by geranylgeranyl isoprenoids. However, in MEL cells treated with 1 microM lovastatin, nonisoprenylated forms of these proteins accumulate in the cytosol prior to arrest of gPr90env processing. These observations suggest that lovastatin may prevent viral envelope precursors from reaching the Golgi compartment by blocking the isoprenylation of rab proteins required for ER to Golgi transport.","['Overmeyer, J H', 'Maltese, W A']","['Overmeyer JH', 'Maltese WA']","['Weis Center for Research, Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania 17822.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation/drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Hexosaminidases/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lovastatin/*pharmacology', 'Mevalonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism']",1992/11/05 00:00,1992/11/05 00:01,['1992/11/05 00:00'],"['1992/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 5;267(31):22686-92.,,['S0021-9258(18)41726-7 [pii]'],,,,,['CA34569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Genomic clones containing the entire FBP1-encoding DNA from both L1210 and LL1 were isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis indicates that, with exception of the 5'-region, the FBP1-encoding locus in both cell lines is identical. The rearrangement in LL1 results from the insertion of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) in the head-to-head (antisense) orientation 72 base pairs (bp) upstream of the FBP1 ATG start codon. The IAP likely provides an alternative promoter for FBP1 expression which may produce a novel transcript with enhanced stability.

Binding studies using 125I-labeled human and murine IL-6 revealed that LIF caused a decrease in IL-6 binding to M1 cells. The decrease became evident within 1 h, and the maximum decrease was observed at 3-6 h. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that M1 cells had a single class of high affinity receptors for IL-6 and that LIF-induced decrease in IL-6 binding was due to a decrease in the number of IL-6R on the cell surface and not to changes in their affinity. The affinity of IL-6R on M1 cells to human IL-6 (Kd = 2.25 nM) was about 10-fold lower than that to murine IL-6 (Kd = 200 pM). The amount of IL-6 secreted into culture media by M1 cells that were treated with LIF for up to 12 h was not enough to cause receptor down-regulation. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that IL-6R mRNA was down-regulated by LIF treatment, and similar regulation was also observed when the cells were treated with IL-6. The time course of the IL-6R mRNA level was similar to that of IL-6R expression on the cell surface, suggesting that the main mechanism responsible for the loss of high affinity IL-6R was the regulation of IL-6R mRNA. Although the half-life of IL-6R on the cell surface was about 30 min, the addition of LIF reduced it to 16 min, suggesting the existence of an additional mechanism responsible for the loss of high affinity IL-6R on the cell surface.","['Yamaguchi, M', 'Michishita, M', 'Hirayoshi, K', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Okuma, M', 'Nagata, K']","['Yamaguchi M', 'Michishita M', 'Hirayoshi K', 'Yasukawa K', 'Okuma M', 'Nagata K']","['Department of Cell Biology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/05 00:00,1992/11/05 00:01,['1992/11/05 00:00'],"['1992/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 5;267(31):22035-42.,,['S0021-9258(18)41631-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their potential similarity as a class, the nucleotide analogues elicited differential effects. The drug-induced up or down regulation of RB expression did not correlate with changes in c-myc expression indicating that the changes are not a manifestation of general metabolic changes potentially associated with altered proliferation.

Both cell lines were found to produce high levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

Whereas TALL-103/2 cells lyse only natural killer cell-susceptible targets, TALL-104 cells display a broad range of tumor target reactivity. In reverse antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), lysis by both cell lines is triggered by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) recognizing CD3 and, to a lesser extent, CD2, but not CD8 or CD56 antigens. In conventional cytotoxic assays, the lytic activity of both cell lines is strictly Ca(2+)-dependent. In reverse ADCC, lysis by TALL-103/2 cells is highly dependent on the presence of Ca2+, whereas TALL-104 cells seem to only partially require extracellular Ca2+. The cytoplasm of both cell lines contains azurophilic granules typical of cytotoxic cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrates mRNA expression of pore-forming protein (PFP; perforin) and serine esterases (SE). The magnitude of expression of these transcripts and of lytic activity depends on the doses of IL-2. Upon deprivation of IL-2, TALL-103/2 cells completely lose cytotoxic granules and function within 16 h, whereas TALL-104 cells progressively lose expression of PFP and SE mRNA, as well as killer activity, within 4 wk.

The stable expression of tumoricidal activity over 2 yr in culture renders these cell lines unique and very useful for studies on the regulation of cell-mediated lysis in vitro and in animal models.","['Cesano, A', 'Santoli, D']","['Cesano A', 'Santoli D']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol,In vitro cellular & developmental biology : journal of the Tissue Culture Association,8506951,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.- (serine esterase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.78 (GZMA protein, human)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Calcium/pharmacology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Esterases/genetics', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol. 1992 Sep-Oct;28A(9-10):648-56. doi: 10.1007/BF02631041.,,['10.1007/BF02631041 [doi]'],,,,,['CA 47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

We found that 70 of the 72 T-cell neoplasms (97%) expressed at least one of these eight T-cell activation-associated antigens (T-AAgs) and that the number and type of T-AAgs expressed by the neoplastic T cells varied according to the clinicopathologic category of T-cell neoplasia. All 5 T-cell lymphoblastic malignancies expressed T10 and T9; 2 also expressed LeuM1. Twelve of 14 (86%) T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (T-CLL) expressed two to four T-AAgs, most frequently T10 (86%) and HLA-DR (79%). The 26 cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) expressed between 2 and 5 T-AAgs, most commonly T9 (92%) and HLA-DR (92%), and least often T10 (12%) and EMA (15%). Twenty-six of 27 (96%) peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) expressed more than 4 T-AAgs. Each of the T-AAgs were expressed by between 22% (LeuM5) and 85% (T9) of the PTCLs. Some T-AAgs were preferentially expressed by the PTCLs in association with other T-AAgs, such as EMA in association with IL2-R and Ki-1. In addition, LeuM5 was preferentially expressed by CD4- CD8+ T-cell neoplasms. However, only 19 of the 72 (26%) T-cell neoplasms (3/5 lymphoblastic malignancies, 3/14 CLLs, 0/26 CTCLs, 13/27 PTCLs) expressed T-AAg immunophenotypic profiles paralleling those expressed by normal peripheral blood T cells activated in vitro with PHA. These results suggest that T-AAg expression by neoplastic T cells does not often mirror the hierarchical order of expression by activated benign T cells, implying that neoplastic T cells do not usually represent the precise malignant counterpart of activated benign, normal T cells.","['Chadburn, A', 'Inghirami, G', 'Knowles, D M']","['Chadburn A', 'Inghirami G', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Antigens, Surface/*blood', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1992;6(3):131-41.,,,,,,,"['CA48236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The present study revealed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulated colony formation by CMK cells; the potency was almost equal to that of IL-3, IL-6 or GM-CSF. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that CMK cells possess two types of specific binding sites for TNF-alpha. The high-affinity binding sites had an affinity constant of 0.18 nM, and numbered 5,000.

A marked heterogeneity existed relative to the intrinsic radiation sensitivity of clonogenic T-lineage ALL/NHL cells from 42 patients. The mean SF2 (surviving fraction at 200 cGy) and alpha values (initial slope of the survival curve) were 0.36 +/- 0.04, and 0.558 +/- 0.079 Gy-1. Fourteen cases had SF2 values of > or = 0.50 and alpha values of < or = 0.2 Gy-1, consistent with a marked intrinsic radiation resistance at the level of clonogenic leukemia/lymphoma cells. Of these 14 radiation resistant cases, 12 were CD3+. Furthermore, the SF2 and D0 values of the 28 CD3+ cases were significantly higher than the SF2 and D0 values of the 14 CD3- cases (SF2: 0.441 +/- 0.048 versus 0.189 +/- 0.045, p = 0.002; D0: 189.6 +/- 26.3 cGy versus 108.7 +/- 18.2 cGy, p = 0.047) and CD3+ cases had smaller alpha values than CD3- cases (0.454 +/- 0.087 versus 0.765 +/- 0.152, p = 0.06). Thus, clonogenic cells from CD3+ T-lineage ALL/NHL patients were more resistant to radiation than clonogenic cells from CD3- T-lineage ALL/NHL patients. In the clinical arm of our study, 33 T-lineage ALL/NHL patients received autologous bone marrow transplants during remission. Pretransplant conditioning consisted of total body irradiation combined with high dose chemotherapy. The expression of CD3 antigen predicted the outcome of relapsed T-lineage ALL/NHL patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation following total body irradiation plus high dose chemotherapy. Overall, the Kaplan-Meier estimate and standard error of the probability of remaining in remission at 3.5 years was 11 +/- 9% with a median relapse-free interval of 102 days. The disease-free survival at 3.5 years was 8 +/- 7% with a median disease-free survival time of 96 days. Notably, the expression of CD3 antigen on T-lineage ALL/NHL cells correlated with the probability of relapse after bone marrow transplantation.

Thirty-four worked on the nickel-cadmium assembly line. Symptoms and signs included: headache in 34; weakness, fatigue and lassitude in 26; dizziness in 16; pruritus and skin eruptions in 37; gingivitis, teeth loss and caries in 34; nasal congestion, nosebleeds and anosmia in 30; cough, phlegm production, wheezing and shortness of breath in 26; ""asthma"" in 14; bone pain in 18; urinary frequency, beta 2 microglobulinuria and kidney stones in 17; and sterility or multiple abortions (33) in 8 of 21 women.

Those who had worked for more than 10 years had more symptoms and signs than shorter-term employees, especially neurological illness, bone pain and urinary tract problems, including beta 2 microglobulinuria. Past blood and urinary cadmium levels were in the range of 1.6-8.7 micrograms/dl and 8-306 micrograms/l, respectively. Our findings indicated that: a) health risks for workers were not confined to the nickel-cadmium assembly line or to older workers, b) hazardous exposures still existed and illness appeared in new workers after a clean-up and intervention program, and c) exposures involved increased risks for renal disease and cancers.

This study provides a regional analysis of cancer incidence and mortality as a method of identifying localizing factors in cancer that can be followed by more specific epidemiologic investigation. In this study we analyze the regional standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for site-specific cancers, by age, sex and continent of birth for the years 1983-86, for the Jewish population of Israel. Elevated total malignant and benign neoplasm SMRs were found in Acre (SMR 109, P < 0.05), Haifa (104, P < 0.05) and Tel Aviv (107, P < 0.001). The only other statistically significantly elevated SMRs were found in Acre for lung cancer (133, P < 0.05) and leukemia (171, P < 0.05). Age and sex-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) by regions are also presented for the years 1980-81 for the Jewish population. Haifa had elevated SIRs for colorectal cancer (126, P < 0.001), breast cancer (118, P < 0.01) and lymphomas (126, P < 0.05). Elevated lung cancer SIRs were found in both Acre (145, P < 0.05) and Ramla (143, P < 0.05). Male to female incidence ratios (MFIRs) for ages 30+ for the Israeli Jewish population are also presented. Elevated bladder cancer MFIRs were found in the heavily industrialized Haifa region (7.69 vs. 4.62 P < 0.05). For Ramla residents, bladder and oronasopharyngeal cancer MFIRs were approximately three times the national average (not statistically significant). Ramla also had elevated MFIRs for lung cancer (14.9 vs. 3.4 nationally, P < 0.01), as did Acre (7.6 vs. 3.4 nationally, P = 0.06). These elevated MFIRs are suggestive of occupational exposure from the cement and asbestos factories in the Ramla and Acre regions. Regional analyses of cancer mortality and cancer incidence (using SMRs, SIRs and MFIRs) can serve as a basic tool for identifying sentinel markers of excess rates. Our findings indicate regions where we should undertake case-referent studies in order to identify potential risk factors and where to target possible preventive programs.","['Ginsberg, G M', 'Tulchinsky, T H']","['Ginsberg GM', 'Tulchinsky TH']","['Department of Statistics, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Israel,Isr J Med Sci,Israel journal of medical sciences,0013105,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Isr J Med Sci. 1992 Aug-Sep;28(8-9):534-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of S 9788 depended on both the MDR cell line and the cytotoxic agent. S 9788 (50-100 mg/kg/d) administered IP once a day on days 1-4 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the chemotherapeutic effect of VCR (0.25 mg/kg/d) in P388/VCR - bearing mice and ADR (4 mg/kg/d) in P388/ADR - bearing mice. Increases in antitumor activity were (% T/C) of +20-34% in the P388/ADR model and + 50-78% in the P388/VCR model with respect to cytotoxic agent treatment alone. S 9788 appeared to be devoid of toxicity at its effective doses.

Results obtained indicate that in the presence of these supernatants leu-enkephalin rapidly disappears and that enkephalin disappearance is paralleled by the formation of peptides that can be interpreted as its hydrolysis fragments. Chromatographic analyses of cell supernatants indicate the presence of three groups of proteins active in leu-enkephalin degradation: aminopeptidases, dipeptidylaminopeptidases and dipeptidylcarboxypeptidases. In all three lines, soluble enzymes are represented by a sizeable number (from 13 to 25) of distinct activities. The number of enzymes identified and their considerable total activity suggest a possible role in the regulatory degradation of informational peptides, as proposed by several groups for the membrane-bound proteolytic enzymes of immunocompetent cells.","['Marini, M', 'Urbani, A', 'Bongiorno, L', 'Roda, L G']","['Marini M', 'Urbani A', 'Bongiorno L', 'Roda LG']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Scienze Biochimiche, II Universita degli Studi di Roma, Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['58822-25-6 (Enkephalin, Leucine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Endopeptidases/*analysis', 'Enkephalin, Leucine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1992 Aug;14(6):995-1002. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(92)90143-9.,,"['0192-0561(92)90143-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(92)90143-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with different diseases, including cancer patients with large tumour burdens, have demonstrated a reduced production of IL-1 from circulating leukocytes, in vitro. There are many naturally occurring substances which inhibit IL-1 activity aspecifically. Recently an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) has been discovered, which is secreted by human macrophages and is structurally similar to IL-1 beta (26% homology). The pretreatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with hrIL-1ra (0.25-250 ng/ml) inhibits IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta and enhances, in a dose-dependent manner, the stimulatory effect of IL-2 on their natural killer (NK) activity against a lymphoid cell line MOLT-4. The enhancing effect of IL-1ra on IL-2 activity was similar to that provoked by IL-1 beta. However, when IL-1ra was used alone without IL-2, no stimulatory effect was found compared with the control. In our data we show that a member of the IL-1 family, IL-1ra, has a significant effect on IL-2-stimulated NK activity against the MOLT-4 cell line. These studies provide new evidence of the biological potential of IL-1ra since this new protein enhances IL-2 activity on NK cells.","['Conti, P', 'Barbacane, R C', 'Panara, M R', 'Reale, M', 'Placido, F C', 'Fridas, S', 'Bongrazio, M', 'Dempsey, R A']","['Conti P', 'Barbacane RC', 'Panara MR', 'Reale M', 'Placido FC', 'Fridas S', 'Bongrazio M', 'Dempsey RA']","['Immunology Division, University of Chieti, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1992 Aug;14(6):987-93. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(92)90142-8.,,"['0192-0561(92)90142-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(92)90142-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that spermine dialdehyde (SDA), an oxidized product of spermine, when used in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) preferentially inhibits T-cell proliferation while sparing myeloid cells. Lethally irradiated mice were rescued by reconstitution with SDA-treated allogeneic marrow and showed no sign of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). In this paper, we show by HPLC analysis that SDA degraded rapidly in PBS but remained intact in saline. Administered in saline, SDA was more inhibitory on leukemic cell lines than normal myeloid or T-cells. Lethally irradiated mice receiving a syngeneic bone marrow leukemic cell mixture treated ex vivo with SDA in saline did not manifest leukemia. Thus, the preferential inhibitory effect of SDA and its degraded products in different buffers suggest that SDA could act as a novel purging agent for both allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantations.","['Lau, C', 'Wang, E', 'Ishaque, A', 'Jones, K', 'Wong, B', 'Kimsto, L', 'Conant, J']","['Lau C', 'Wang E', 'Ishaque A', 'Jones K', 'Wong B', 'Kimsto L', 'Conant J']","['Biological Research Department, R.

The activity of IFNs was mainly related to the induction of an active antiviral competence in host's immune effector cells. The antiviral activity of IFN-boosted CBMC could be ascribed both to a positive regulation of cell-mediated immunity and to inhibition of viral infection. Data described herein provide further information on the mechanisms of the antiviral activity of IFNs and compare the activity of each type of IFN with the association of alpha + beta, alpha + gamma and beta + gamma IFNs, at a concentration of 100 or 1000 IU/ml. When added at the onset of the co-culture of CBMC with lethally irradiated, virus-donor MT-2 cells, IFNs could protect host CBMC by inhibiting HTLV-1 infection in terms of reduced proviral integration and a lower percentage of virus-positive cells, until 4 weeks of culture. Infection of CBMC was inhibited at a comparable extent by either individual or combined IFN treatments. However, a clearcut inhibition of HTLV-I transcription was found only when alpha 100 + beta 1000 IU/ml and especially alpha 1000 + gamma 100 IU/ml combined treatments were tested. When the chronically infected, virus-producing MT-2 cells were treated with IFNs, a remarkable inhibition of HTLV-I transcription was found only after multiple treatments. However, MT-2 cells became resistant to the antiviral activity of IFN gamma, but not to that of IFN alpha or beta. These data provide further information on the control of HTLV-I replication mediated by IFNs at different steps of the viral life cycle, being therefore relevant to the clinical use of combined IFNs in the treatment of acute infection. Moreover, IFNs could be used to prevent the establishment of a persistent infection, which is a prerequisite for developing adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and/or virus-associated myelopathy.","[""D'Onofrio, C"", 'Franzese, O', 'Puglianiello, A', 'Peci, E', 'Lanzilli, G', 'Bonmassar, E']","[""D'Onofrio C"", 'Franzese O', 'Puglianiello A', 'Peci E', 'Lanzilli G', 'Bonmassar E']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, II University of Rome, Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/microbiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1992 Aug;14(6):1069-79. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(92)90152-b.,,"['0192-0561(92)90152-B [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(92)90152-b [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas fetal liver cells from diploid mice can be easily immortalized by retroviral transformation with Ab1-MuLV or J2 virus, fetal livers from Ts16 mice contain significantly fewer transformable cells. Infection of Ts16 fetal liver cells by Ab1-MuLV results in a 52- and 12-fold reduction in the frequency of transformation at days 17 and 18 of gestation, respectively. By contrast, the efficiency of transformation with J2 virus, another retrovirus known to transform fetal liver cells, is only mildly (factor 2-3) affected. The Ig gene rearrangements of Ts16 and diploid retrovirally transformed fetal liver cell lines do not differ from one another.

Other Pacific populations with high prevalences of HTLV-I infection include several remote groups in West New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, which have had no contact with Japanese or Africans. By contrast, Micronesian and Polynesian populations, even those with prolonged contact with Japanese, exhibit low prevalences or no evidence of HTLV-I infection. Low prevalences of infection are also found in Australia, except among some aboriginal populations. Changing patterns of HTLV-I infection and disease are no better exemplified than in Japan, where striking reductions in transfusion-acquired infection and subsequent development of HAM/TSP have followed the institution of nationwide screening of blood donors for HTLV-I infection. Furthermore, virus transmission from mother to infant by means of infected breast milk has been markedly curtailed in HTLV-I-hyperendemic regions in Japan by interrupting the practice of breast feeding by HTLV-I-infected mothers.

It is known, however, that IFN is able to induce hematologic, immunological and phenotype membrane changes which parallel the patients' (pts) clinical response. The aim of our study was to correlate the clinical response to IFN treatment with ultrastructural and phenotype membrane changes in hairy cells (HCs), in order to elucidate the mechanism of IFN action at the cell level. METHODS: We assessed the phenotype membrane and ultrastructural changes induced in HCs by long-term alpha-IFN treatment in five pts with HCL; membrane-bound Il 2-R on PHA-stimulated PBL, the release of IL 2-R by PHA-stimulated PBL and the serum levels of s-IL 2-R were also determined in one pt. RESULTS: The surface immunological phenotype, mainly the HCL-related surface antigen CD25, changed after IFN treatment, dropping from abnormally high to normal values. Furthermore, IFN treatment induced ultrastructural changes in HCs, consisting mainly of a sharp reduction in, up to the almost complete disappearance of, the hairy projections: very few, if any, short, thick villi persisted. The ultrastructural changes in HCs paralleled clinical and hematologic response to IFN treatment in such a way that IFN alone may be considered the cause of these changes. As far as detection of the membrane-bound IL 2-R p55 chain on PHA-stimulated PBL is concerned, the expression of p55 is very high on the membrane of HCs; a high level of serum s-IL 2-R was also found in the HCL pt studied before IFN treatment, whereas the release of IL 2-R by PHA-stimulated PBL was higher than normal, but not significantly. Two of our pts, who did not respond or responded very poorly clinically to IFN treatment, should probably be considered cases of HCL ""variants"". CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype membrane and the ultrastructural changes in HCs very closely paralleled the patients' clinical responses to IFN, suggesting that both the immunologic and the morphologic changes induced in HCs by in vivo IFN treatment are a direct counterpart of its biologic effect.","['Mantovani, G', 'Astara, G', 'Curreli, L', 'Lai, P', 'Turnu, E', 'Locci, F', 'Lantini, M S', 'Cossu, M', 'Riva, A', 'Del Giacco, G S']","['Mantovani G', 'Astara G', 'Curreli L', 'Lai P', 'Turnu E', 'Locci F', 'Lantini MS', 'Cossu M', 'Riva A', 'Del Giacco GS']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna, Universita di Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 Jul-Aug;77(4):326-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It generally terminates with a blastic crisis (BC). One third of BC are lymphoid, and most have a pre-B phenotype. Few cases of T-lymphoid BC have been reported. Here we describe a lymph node blast crisis mimicking T-immunoblastic lymphoma. METHODS: Bone marrow and lymph nodes were histologically examined by standard methods and by an immunoperoxidase technique. Cytogenetic studies were also performed on lymph node and blood cells. Analysis of T-cell receptor genes and BCR rearrangements were performed on DNA extracted from both frozen bone marrow and lymph-node cells. RESULTS: Lymph-node histology showed an infiltration by large lymphoid blasts, consistent with a diagnosis of immunoblastic lymphoma. Blast cells were CD2, CD7, TDT positive, and negative for myeloid and mature lymphoid antigens. The Ph1 chromosome was found in both bone marrow and lymph-node cells. BCR rearrangement was found in the DNA from both bone marrow and lymph-node cells. TCR genes were not rearranged. DISCUSSION: The present study provides strong evidence that the lymph-node blast crisis of CML can assume the morphological appearance of immunoblastic lymphoma and may retain the immunological phenotype and genetic features of early T cells with BCR rearrangements.","['Leone, G', 'La Rocca, L M', 'Teofili, L', 'De Candia, E', 'Landolfi, R', 'Sica, S', 'Zini, G', 'Zollino, M', 'Tabilio, A']","['Leone G', 'La Rocca LM', 'Teofili L', 'De Candia E', 'Landolfi R', 'Sica S', 'Zini G', 'Zollino M', 'Tabilio A']","['Istituti di Semeiotica Medica, Universita Cattolica del S.

The patient, a 22-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), developed fever and diffuse cutaneous maculopapular necrotising nodules during post-chemotherapy neutropenia. Fusarium verticilloides was isolated from the skin, and hyphae were observed on direct microscopy. Despite increased WBC and amphotericin B (AmB) treatment (0.7 mg/kg/day for 11 days), he remained febrile and a chest X-ray revealed pulmonary lesions. Fusarium infection was confirmed by bronchial aspirate. AmB was increased to 1 mg/kg/day, and continued for 16 days (total dose 1630 mg). A slight improvement was observed at tomography, but nephrotoxicity developed. Treatment was changed to L-AmB (3 mg/kg/day). The patient received this drug for 20 days (total dose of 3850 mg) with complete regression of the pulmonary lesions. No adverse event occurred, and nephrotoxicity resolved. The patient was discharged from hospital cured of the Fusarium infection and in clinical and haematological remission. No relapse of fusariosis occurred, despite additional courses of intensive chemotherapy. Ambisome could represent an important advance in antifungal treatment since it allows aggressive treatment and eradication of mycoses refractory to conventional therapy while avoiding renal toxicity.","['Cofrancesco, E', 'Boschetti, C', 'Viviani, M A', 'Bargiggia, C', 'Tortorano, A M', 'Cortellaro, M', 'Zanussi, C']","['Cofrancesco E', 'Boschetti C', 'Viviani MA', 'Bargiggia C', 'Tortorano AM', 'Cortellaro M', 'Zanussi C']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna, Universita di Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Liposomes)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications', 'Dermatomycoses/complications/*drug therapy', '*Fusarium', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Liposomes', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 May-Jun;77(3):280-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various conditioning regimens were used according to the disease and time of BMT. In this paper we evaluate the impact of the experience of a pediatric hematology center on BMT-related problems in children. METHODS: We analyzed disease-free survival (DFS), early BMT-related effects, hepatic, cardiac and respiratory function and late endocrine effects as shown by standard instrumental and laboratory tests. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Outcome (overall median follow-up 34 months) was satisfactory. Three years DFS was 50.1% in all patients, 58.8% in lymphoblastic leukemia in 2nd complete remission (CR), and 50.0% in acute myeloid leukemia (some in 2nd or subsequent CR). Three of four patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were alive at 38 months. Management of the problems causing early post-BMT toxicity contributed to a progressive fall in early morbidity and mortality (14.3% in the last 3 years). Pre-BMT hepatitis in most patients was not associated with increased post-BMT hepatotoxicity. Cardiac function, even in patients given aggressive anthracycline treatment before BMT, remained normal 3 years after transplantation, as did respiratory function, although 8 cases presented subclinical restrictive and/or obstructive alterations. Compensated hypothyroidism was observed in 9 patients. Six boys received replacement treatment for hypogonadism. Severe height impairment was seen in 2 patients.

We studied thymic epithelial function in childhood T-ALL as compared to normal controls in order to improve our understanding of the cellular immunodeficiency mechanisms operating in a thymus-linked malignant process. The levels of Facteur Thymique Serique (FTS) were measured in 9 patients at diagnosis, according to the rosette inhibition assay of Dardenne & Bach (1975). This method is based on the capacity of human serum containing FTS activity to confer on rosette-forming cells (RFC) from adult thymectomized mice a sensitivity to azathioprine identical to that of normal mouse RFC. All patients presented low age-corrected titres of FTS. No zinc deficiency was found, suggesting that low FTS levels are not related to unexpressed FTS biological activity. Plasma from all the children studied contained factors capable of inhibiting the biological activity of FTS in vitro. However, the nature of this inhibitor has not yet been elucidated. Our study shows the presence of a thymic dysfunction in childhood T-ALL, which could partially explain the immunodeficiency described in these patients.

Clinical and cytogenetic results at 2 years in 322 patients. The Italian Cooperative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.,204-14,"BACKGROUND: Standard or conventional treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) had little effect on the course and the duration of the disease. Treatment with human natural and recombinant alpha-interferon (IFN) was shown to induce hematologic responses, together with partial or complete repopulation of the marrow with Ph negative cells (karyotypic response). These findings prompted a prospective comparison of IFN and conventional treatment in CML. METHODS: A multicenter prospective controlled study in previously untreated or minimally treated chronic phase Ph+ CML was employed: 322 patients were recruited between 1986 and 1988 and assigned to treatment with human recombinant alpha-IFN (Roferon-A) or hydroxyurea, with a randomization ratio of 2:1. The results of the first 2 years of treatment were analyzed and compared, based on the intention-to-treat policy. RESULTS: From 8 mo of treatment on, hematologic and karyotypic responses (KR) were more frequent and better in the IFN arm than in the CHT arm. Overall, a major KR (Ph neg greater than 66%) was achieved at least once in 35/218 (16%) IFN-treated patients vs 1/104 CHT-treated ones (P less than 0.0001). None of these 36 patients has progressed from chronic to blastic phase as yet. After 2 years of treatment, 21 of 218 IFN patients (10%) had a major KR vs 1 of 104 CHT patients (P = 0.003), and the cumulative proportion of blastic metamorphosis was 19% in the IFN arm vs 27% in the CHT arm (P = 0.17). Side effects were more frequent in the IFN arm, but compliance with the treatment policy was identical in both arms. The treatment cost was about 11 US dollars per patient per month in the CHT arm, and 200 times higher in the IFN arm. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 years of treatment, IFN was more expensive, had more side effects, but was more effective than CHT in terms of hematologic and karyotypic responses.",,,,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/genetics/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 May-Jun;77(3):204-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This elongation block within the first c-myc exon was defined originally in mammalian cells by nuclear run-on transcription analyses. Subsequent oocyte injection and in vitro transcription analyses suggested that sequences near the end of the first c-myc exon are sites of attenuation and/or premature termination. We report here that the mapping of single stranded DNA in vivo with potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and nuclear run-on transcription assays reveal that polymerase is paused near position +30 relative to the major c-myc transcription initiation site. Deletion of 350 bp, including the sites of 3'-end formation and intrinsic termination defined in oocyte injection and in vitro transcription assays does not affect-the pausing of polymerase in the promoter-proximal region. In addition, sequences upstream of +47 are sufficient to confer the promoter-proximal pausing of polymerases and to generate the polarity of transcription farther downstream. Thus, the promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II complexes accounts for the block to elongation within the c-myc gene in mammalian cells. We speculate that modification of polymerase complexes at the promoter-proximal pause site may determine whether polymerases can read through intrinsic sites of termination farther downstream.","['Krumm, A', 'Meulia, T', 'Brunvand, M', 'Groudine, M']","['Krumm A', 'Meulia T', 'Brunvand M', 'Groudine M']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '00OT1QX5U4 (Potassium Permanganate)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Exons', '*Genes, Regulator', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Potassium Permanganate/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 1992 Nov;6(11):2201-13. doi: 10.1101/gad.6.11.2201.,,['10.1101/gad.6.11.2201 [doi]'],,['c-myc'],,,"['CA54337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57156/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We identified the CArG boxes as a Tax1-responsive cis-acting element for the cellular immediate early genes c-fos, egr-1, and egr-2. Using a chimeric protein consisting of the CArG-binding factor p67SRF and the heterologous DNA-binding domain of a yeast transcription factor GAL4, we demonstrated that Tax1 activates the transcriptional activity of p67SRF through the GAL4-binding site. The carboxy-terminal half of p67SRF, which lacks domains for DNA-binding, dimerization, and ternary complex formation with p62TCF, was sufficient for the activation by Tax1. Tax1 produced in Escherichia coli bound p67SRF in vitro. The complex formation in vivo was also indicated by the finding that the acidic activation domain of VP16, by fusion to p67SRF, can complement the transcriptional activation function of a mutant Tax1 in trans. Thus, Tax1 activates CArG-mediated transcription without mitogenic signals through interaction with a CArG-binding factor, p67SRF. This must be one of the primary steps by which Tax1 causes aberration in growth control of the infected cells.","['Fujii, M', 'Tsuchiya, H', 'Chuhjo, T', 'Akizawa, T', 'Seiki, M']","['Fujii M', 'Tsuchiya H', 'Chuhjo T', 'Akizawa T', 'Seiki M']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (EGR2 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', '*Genes, fos', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor', '*Signal Transduction', '*TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 1992 Nov;6(11):2066-76. doi: 10.1101/gad.6.11.2066.,,['10.1101/gad.6.11.2066 [doi]'],,"['c-fos', 'egr-1', 'egr-2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groups (n = 28) of rats were fed diets adequate (60 ppm) or marginally deficient (7 ppm) in zinc and containing cadmium at various levels (0, 25, 50, 100, or 200 ppm). Lesions were assessed over the following 77 weeks. Zinc deficiency alone had no effect on survival, growth, or food consumption. Cadmium treatment did not reduce survival or food consumption and only at the highest doses of cadmium (100 and 200 ppm) was body weight reduced (maximum 17%). The incidence of prostatic proliferative lesions, both hyperplasias and adenomas, was increased over that seen in controls (1.8%) in both zinc-adequate (20%) and zinc-deficient rats (14%) fed 50 ppm cadmium. The overall incidence for prostatic lesions for all cadmium treatment groups was, however, much lower in zinc-deficient rats, possibly because of a marked increase in prostatic atrophy that was associated with reduced zinc intake. Cadmium treatment resulted in an elevated leukemia incidence (maximum 4.8-fold over control) in both zinc-adequate and zinc-deficient groups, although zinc deficiency reduced the potency of cadmium in this respect. Testicular tumors were significantly elevated only in rats receiving 200 ppm cadmium and diets adequate in zinc. Both zinc-deficient and zinc-adequate groups showed significant positive trends for development of testicular neoplasia with increasing cadmium dosage. Thus, oral cadmium exposure is clearly associated with tumors of the prostate, testes, and hematopoietic system in rats, while dietary zinc deficiency has complex, apparently inhibitory, effects on cadmium carcinogenesis by this route.","['Waalkes, M P', 'Rehm, S']","['Waalkes MP', 'Rehm S']","['Inorganic Carcinogenesis Section, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Fundam Appl Toxicol,Fundamental and applied toxicology : official journal of the Society of Toxicology,8200838,"['00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Cadmium/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced', 'Prostate/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Testicular Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Zinc/*deficiency']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fundam Appl Toxicol. 1992 Nov;19(4):512-20. doi: 10.1016/0272-0590(92)90089-z.,,['10.1016/0272-0590(92)90089-z [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our present data indicate that B-BPA plays an important role as an erythroid colony-stimulating factor (E-CSF) in modulating progenitor growth and differentiation throughout erythropoiesis. E-CSF has discrete effects on both early (erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E) and late (erythroid colony-forming units, CFU-E) progenitors from normal bone marrow. In serum-substituted fibrin clot cultures, E-CSF stimulates the proliferation of BFU-E, resulting in an increase in the number of erythroid bursts over a wide range of erythropoietin (Epo) concentrations. We now have shown that E-CSF also acts on CFU-E by increasing their sensitivity to Epo markedly, resulting in a tenfold left-shift in the Epo dose-response curve. Using purified target-cell populations of human and murine erythroleukemia cells that are Epo-independent for growth, we have found that E-CSF stimulates cell proliferation directly, increasing the plating efficiency of these cells in suspension culture by 50%-165%. B-BPA also increased proliferation of these cells in semi-solid medium. Importantly, the combination of E-CSF and Epo resulted in a profound increase in the growth and maturation of the resultant colonies. Therefore, the data indicate that E-CSF can regulate the growth of cells independently of added Epo and, in addition, can synergize with Epo in regulating the growth and differentiation of erythroid progenitors.","['Feldman, L', 'Frazier, J G', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Feldman L', 'Frazier JG', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, New England Deaconess Hospital, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*analysis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythropoiesis/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*analysis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Nov;20(10):1223-8.,,,,,,,['DK41395/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in the present study, we investigated whether IL-1 affects the kinetics of IL-6-induced IL-2R alpha expression in M1 cells. By cytofluorometry, we find that surface expression of IL-2R alpha at 24 h after induction by IL-6 is strongly enhanced by IL-1. However, IL-1 does not change the transient kinetics of expression of IL-2R alpha. Binding data and Scatchard analysis support these results and show an increase from 3100 to 17,620 low-affinity IL-2 binding sites per cell without any change in affinity after induction of M1 cells by the combination of IL-6 and IL-1. By Northern analysis, we find that the increase in IL-2R alpha surface expression after treatment with IL-6 and IL-1 occurs in parallel with an increase in IL-2R alpha but not IL-2R beta mRNA expression. By nuclear run-on analysis and actinomycin-D chase experiments, we find that the increase in IL-2R alpha mRNA expression is due to both an increase in IL-2R alpha gene transcription and to an increase in IL-2R alpha mRNA stability. These data suggest that the IL-6-induced expression of IL-2R alpha can be specifically up-regulated by IL-1, however, without affecting the transient nature in expression of IL-2R alpha.","['Ruhl, S', 'Schwabe, M', 'Pluznik, D H']","['Ruhl S', 'Schwabe M', 'Pluznik DH']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Dactinomycin', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Half-Life', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Nov;20(10):1208-15.,,,,['IL-2R&agr;'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not due to the lack of uptake of 1,25(OH)2D3 by HL60-araC cells, shown by an increased rate of intracellular accumulation of [3H]-1,25(OH)2D3, or to the lack of expression of the gene for the vitamin D3 receptor.

In contrast, the expression of the constitutively expressed 16S mitochondrial rRNA gene is unchanged by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment of either cell subline.

By using this observation, we have developed a mathematical modelling that allows the determination of the overall daily production of IL-6 in this patient, which was in the range of 15 micrograms per day.

As a first step in the analysis of the regulation of HisDC gene expression, we have cloned the cDNA coding for HisDC from a cDNA library of a human basophilic leukemia cell line, KU-812-F. We identified two types of HisDC cDNA, representing the 2.4-kb and 3.4-kb HisDC mRNA constitutively expressed in these cells. Sequence analysis of these cDNA revealed that the 3.4-kb mRNA contains the insert sequence of 824 bases and suggests that both 2.4-kb and 3.4-kb mRNA may represent the alternatively spliced transcripts of the HisDC gene. Using expression plasmids containing a cDNA for each HisDC mRNA, we analyzed the function of possible HisDC isoforms. We show that only the 2.4-kb mRNA encodes functional HisDC and is expressed in human brain and lung. However, we were unable to detect the 3.4-kb mRNA in these tissues.

M1 myeloid leukaemic cells respond to IL-6 with activation of a terminal differentiation programme which includes activation of genes for certain haemopoietic regulatory proteins (IL-6, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], M-CSF, tumour necrosis factor and transforming growth factor [TGF] beta 1) and for receptors for some of these proteins, thus establishing a network of positive and negative regulatory cytokines. IL-6 and some other cytokines also induce during differentiation sustained levels of transcription factors that can regulate and maintain gene expression in the differentiation programme. M1 leukaemic cells induced to differentiate with IL-6 undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) on withdrawal of IL-6, and can be rescued from apoptosis by IL-6, IL-3, M-CSF, G-CSF or IL-1, but not by GM-CSF. These differentiating leukaemic cells can also be rescued from apoptosis by the tumour promoter TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) but not by the non-tumour-promoting isomer 4-alpha-TPA, and rescue from apoptosis can be achieved by different pathways. Apoptosis can also be induced in undifferentiated M1 leukaemic cells by expression of the wild-type form of the tumour suppressor p53 protein and IL-6 can rescue the cells from this wild-type p53-mediated apoptosis. There are clones of M1 cells that differentiate with IL-6 but not with LIF and another M1 clone that differentiates with either IL-6 or LIF.

However, loci related to sequences in the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA have been detected and located elsewhere in the genome. The LIF gene from four mammalian species has been cloned and sequenced; the sequences are highly conserved within the coding regions and largely non-conserved within the non-coding regions. However, a number of non-coding segments displaying high interspecies similarity are evident; these are candidate control regions. Intriguingly, an exon corresponding to the 5' end of a variant LIF transcript in the mouse that encodes a potentially matrix-associated form of LIF is not conserved in the human, ovine and porcine genes. The promoter region of the LIF gene contains four well-conserved TATA elements, and two start sites of transcription have been identified. Three regions within the 5' flanking region have been identified as important for the function of the LIF promoter, including a candidate repressor sequence.

The demonstration by equilibrium binding analysis and autoradiography of LIF receptors on all of the above cells and cell lines suggests that each of these pleiotropic effects of LIF is mediated by direct interactions with the responding cells rather than by the indirect release of secondary cytokines. Despite the differing biological effects of LIF on these cells, equilibrium binding, kinetic analyses and receptor internalization studies have all suggested that these cells display essentially identical high affinity LIF receptors. Nevertheless, there is evidence on some cell types (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] transgenic peritoneal cells and F9 embryonal carcinoma cells) for a second class of low affinity LIF receptors (Kd = 1.5 nM versus Kd = 30 pM for high affinity receptors) which, LIF receptors (Kd = 1.5 nM versus Kd = 30 pM for high affinity receptors) which differ from the high affinity receptors only in kinetic dissociation rate. Moreover, the evidence suggests that low and high affinity receptors are structurally related and interconvertible, because detergent solubilization of LIF receptors from any cell type results in the quantitative conversion of high affinity receptors into low affinity receptors. As is the case for other related cytokine receptors, these data suggest that high affinity LIF receptors may be composed of two protein subunits--one responsible for LIF-specific low affinity binding and the other responsible for affinity conversion and cell signalling by the receptor. Such a model provides a possible explanation for the pleiotropy of LIF's biological actions.","['Hilton, D J', 'Nicola, N A', 'Metcalf, D']","['Hilton DJ', 'Nicola NA', 'Metcalf D']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Solubility', 'Tissue Distribution/physiology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1992;167:227-39; discussion 239-44. doi: 10.1002/9780470514269.ch14.,,['10.1002/9780470514269.ch14 [doi]'],,,19,,['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This revealed that LIF is a cytokine active on bone, in addition to its several other sites of action. In organ culture of newborn mouse bone, recombinant LIF promoted bone resorption by a prostaglandin-dependent process. Resorption by isolated rat osteoclasts was also promoted by LIF through an initial action on osteoblasts which was receptor-mediated. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was increased by LIF in cells (most probably osteoblasts) of the newborn mouse bones. Osteoblasts have been shown to produce LIF, and the amount is increased by treatment with retinoic acid or TNF-alpha. LIF also acts directly on osteoblasts to inhibit plasminogen activator activity, by stimulating the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 mRNA and protein. The latter actions are very similar to those of TGF-beta. Again like TGF-beta, LIF was ineffective in promoting bone resorption in vitro in fetal rat long bones. These results, together with the in vivo data showing that high circulating levels of LIF in the mouse are accompanied by a substantial increase in trabecular bone mass, indicate that LIF is another cytokine with potent actions on bone and potentially important interactions with other osteotrophic factors.","['Martin, T J', 'Allan, E H', 'Evely, R S', 'Reid, I R']","['Martin TJ', 'Allan EH', 'Evely RS', 'Reid IR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Resorption/chemically induced', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1992;167:141-50; discussion 150-5. doi: 10.1002/9780470514269.ch9.,,['10.1002/9780470514269.ch9 [doi]'],,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF, also known as leukaemia inhibitory factor, LIF) affects the development of cultured cells from both systems. To understand the role of CDF/LIF during normal development in vivo, we have begun to localize its mRNA in the late fetal and postnatal rat. Application of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and RNase protection methods reveals that CDF/LIF mRNA levels are developmentally modulated in both haemopoietic and neural tissues. A target tissue of cholinergic sympathetic neurons, the footpads that contain the sweat glands, express high levels of this mRNA (relative to mRNA for actin and beta 2-microglobulin). Levels in targets of noradrenergic neurons are lower, but do undergo significant changes during development. Signals are also detected in selective regions of the adult brain, and in embryonic skeletal muscle. This finding in muscle may be significant for motor neurons, because CDF/LIF is a trophic factor for these neurons in culture. Embryonic liver, neonatal thymus and postnatal spleen express CDF/LIF mRNA, and expression in gut is the highest of all tissues examined. The selective tissue distribution and developmental modulation of CDF/LIF mRNA expression support a role for this factor in the normal development of several organ systems.","['Patterson, P H', 'Fann, M J']","['Patterson PH', 'Fann MJ']","['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Immune System/*embryology/growth & development', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Nervous System/*embryology/growth & development', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Ribonucleases']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1992;167:125-35; discussion 135-40. doi: 10.1002/9780470514269.ch8.,,['10.1002/9780470514269.ch8 [doi]'],,,31,,,,,,,,,,,,

The qualitative and quantitative changes in the expression of plasma proteins serve as defining criteria for cytokine function. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are representatives of a group of cytokines which display strikingly similar effects in both human and rodent liver cells. Hallmarks of the action of these cytokines are the stimulation of type 2 acute-phase plasma proteins and enhancement of the effect of interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) on type 1 acute-phase plasma proteins. The transcriptional activation of the various acute-phase plasma protein genes involves common cis-acting regulatory elements whose sequences and location relative to the transcription start site vary from gene to gene. The activity of the IL-6- and LIF-responsive genes depends in part on transcription factors including several members of the C/EBP family, JunB and the glucocorticoid receptor. The expression of these transcription factors is in turn under cytokine-specific control. In a few cases, expression is temporally correlated with the activation of 'late' acute-phase protein genes. The finding that structurally distinct cytokines interact with separate receptors but elicit an almost identical liver cell response demands a reassessment of the contribution of each factor to the in vivo acute-phase response.","['Baumann, H', 'Marinkovic-Pajovic, S', 'Won, K A', 'Jones, V E', 'Campos, S P', 'Jahreis, G P', 'Morella, K K']","['Baumann H', 'Marinkovic-Pajovic S', 'Won KA', 'Jones VE', 'Campos SP', 'Jahreis GP', 'Morella KK']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/cytology/*drug effects', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1992;167:100-14; discussion 114-24. doi: 10.1002/9780470514269.ch7.,,['10.1002/9780470514269.ch7 [doi]'],,,27,,"['CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK33886/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Quercetin reversibly blocked the cell cycle at a point 3-6 h before the start of DNA synthesis. Expression of the growth-related genes histone H4, cyclin A and B, and p34cdc2 was suppressed in cells blocked with quercetin. Comparison of the quercetin arrest points with those of the cell cycle inhibitors aphidicolin and mimosine revealed a temporal order of arrest points in G1 of quercetin, mimosine, and aphidicolin. Mimosine and aphidicolin did not inhibit the expression of cyclin A or p34cdc2, whereas all three reagents inhibited expression of cyclin B. Low concentrations of the protein inhibitor cycloheximide inhibited release of the quercetin but not the mimosine or aphidicolin block. A [35S]methionine-labeled M(r) 60,000 protein disappeared in quercetin-treated cells and was rapidly synthesized after removal of quercetin, suggesting the possibility that the M(r) 60,000 protein induces DNA synthesis after the cell is released from a quercetin block.

The present studies were undertaken to determine if the cytotoxicity of MMC or its analogues is affected by cellular glutathione (GSH) and/or GSH transferase (GST) levels by using sensitive (P388/S) and multidrug resistant (P388/R-84) mouse leukemia cells as a model. P388/R-84 cells were cross-resistant to all three drugs. BMY 25067 was > 100 times more cytotoxic than MMC in both the cells. MMC and BMY 25282 produced significantly lower DNA interstrand cross-links (ISC) in P388/R-84 cells, whereas BMY 25067 induced ISC formation was comparable in these cells. GSH depletion with D,L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) increased sensitivity to MMC, BMY 25282, and BMY 25067 by 3.4-, 4.1-, and 1.8-fold, respectively, in the resistant cells. Pretreatment of P388/R-84 cells with a nontoxic concentration of ethacrynic acid (EA) (10 micrograms/ml for 1 h), an inhibitor of GST activity, also resulted in a significant increase in the cytotoxic activities of MMC and BMY 25282 (3.8- and 3.1-fold, respectively), but not of BMY 25067. Combined pretreatment of P388/R-84 cells with BSO and EA caused further increase in the cytotoxic activities of both MMC and BMY 25282. Potentiation of BMY 25067 cytotoxicity by combined BSO and EA pretreatments was similar to that observed by BSO pretreatment alone. The ISC formation by MMC and BMY 25282 were also increased significantly by BSO or EA pretreatment in these cells. Whereas BSO treatment increased BMY 25067 induced ISC formation, it was not affected by EA pretreatment. These results suggest that (a) a potentiation of the cytotoxic activity of MMC or BMY 25282 can be achieved by GSH depletion and/or GST inhibition, (b) the enhanced cytotoxicity may be caused at least in part by the increased formation of drug-DNA cross-links, and (c) the mechanism of BMY 25067 cytotoxicity may be different from the other two drugs. The results of the present study also suggest that BMY 25067 may be seriously considered for further clinical development because it is much more active than MMC, and unlike the parent drug cytotoxicity of BMY 25067 does not seem to be affected by GST levels, which have been suggested to play an important role in cellular resistance to several cancer chemotherapy drugs.","['Xu, B H', 'Singh, S V']","['Xu BH', 'Singh SV']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA 15219.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '88949-01-3 (N(6)-((dimethylamino)methylene)mitomycin C)', '95056-36-3 (N-7-(2-(nitrophenyldithio)ethyl)mitomycin C)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'M5DP350VZV (Ethacrynic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ethacrynic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mitomycin/metabolism/*therapeutic use', '*Mitomycins', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Dec 1;52(23):6666-70.,,,,,,,['CA 50638/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and subsequent nucleotide sequencing disclosed no alteration of the p53 gene in chronic phase (no mutation in 80 samples), while five of 31 BC samples showed point mutations: four in myeloid and one in lymphoid crisis. One of seven accelerated phase samples also showed a p53 gene mutation. Ten of 31 BC samples showed loss of one of the short arms of chromosome 17 (17p) through the formation of isochromosome 17q, i(17q), or unbalanced translocations. Loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus in the accelerated phase and BC was detected only in two cases with i(17q) but not in seven cases with normal chromosome 17 homologues, suggesting that loss of one p53 allele is rare without cytogenetically detectable loss of a 17p. Among those six samples with p53 gene mutations, five showed loss of a 17p cytogenetically, and only one lymphoid crisis case exhibited normal chromosome 17 homologues. Thus, mutations of the p53 gene were closely associated with myeloid crisis with loss of a 17p (four mutations in ten samples), in contrast to myeloid crisis with normal chromosome 17 homologues (zero in 13) or lymphoid crisis (one in seven). Our results also suggest that alterations of the p53 gene might occur after loss of a 17p during the course of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Nakai, H', 'Misawa, S', 'Toguchida, J', 'Yandell, D W', 'Ishizaki, K']","['Nakai H', 'Misawa S', 'Toguchida J', 'Yandell DW', 'Ishizaki K']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Dec 1;52(23):6588-93.,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that under conditions which modulated multidrug-resistant (30 microM SR33557 for 1 h), P388/ADR cells presented an original sequestration of DOX in large intracellular vesicles, where SR33557 is itself sequestered, as seen by colocalization studies. Colocalization experiments with lysosomal and mitochondrial probes suggest that these vesicles are neither mitochondrial in nature nor functional lysosomes. To investigate the biochemical basis for this effect, we studied the impact of SR33557 on the sphingolipid metabolism of P388/ADR cells. We observed that although P388/ADR cells normally catabolized exogenous [3H]sphingomyelin, when pretreated with SR33557 they showed almost complete inhibition of sphingomyelin breakdown. Finally, in order to demonstrate that the inability of P388/ADR cells to degrade sphingomyelin in the presence of SR33557 (which is a potent inhibitor of acid lysosomal sphingomyelinase) leads to phospholipid accumulation, we performed electron microscopy where we observed laminated inclusions. These morphological modifications are similar to those observed in Niemann-Pick disease lymphoblastoid cell lines which are inherently deficient in acid sphingomyelinase activity. The observation that, in the absence of SR33557, these Niemann-Pick disease cell lines presented similar DOX sequestration to that of SR33557-treated P388/ADR cells strongly suggests that DOX accumulates in SR33557-induced myeloid bodies. The redistribution of DOX within these vesicles, perhaps by preventing its expulsion by P-glycoprotein, may be a key in discovering the mechanism of action of SR33557.","['Jaffrezou, J P', 'Levade, T', 'Chatelain, P', 'Laurent, G']","['Jaffrezou JP', 'Levade T', 'Chatelain P', 'Laurent G']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et de Toxicologie Fondamentales, Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Phenethylamines)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'KU213XYO69 (fantofarone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hydrolysis', 'Indolizines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phenethylamines/*pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vacuoles/metabolism']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Dec 1;52(23):6440-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, NDDP entrapped in multilamellar vesicles composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) at a 7:3 molar ratio was non-nephrotoxic in humans, not cross-resistant with cisplatin in different in vitro and in vivo systems, and more active than cisplatin against murine models of experimental liver metastases whereas free NDDP was devoid of in vivo antitumor activity at the optimal dose of L-NDDP and barely active at higher doses. To elucidate the mechanisms by which the liposomal carrier enhances the biological properties to this class of antitumor agents, we studied the effect of the liposome composition, size of the branched leaving groups of the platinum compound, and pH and composition of the aqueous phase on the entrapment efficiency, drug leakage, drug stability, and in vivo toxicity and antitumor activity of different liposomal formulations of these agents. In experiments using normal saline as aqueous phase, the presence of DMPG in the lipid bilayer resulted in a decreased stability and an increased biological activity of NDDP, whereas NDDP entrapped in liposomes composed of DMPC alone (not containing DMPG) was stable but devoid of antitumor activity. In studies with structurally related analogues with branched leaving groups of 5, 6, 7, and 9 carbon atoms, similar trends were observed. In addition, the number of carbon atoms in the leaving groups was directly and inversely related to the entrapment efficiency and stability of the analogues, respectively, independently of lipid composition; increasing the size of the branched leaving groups resulted in an increased in situ degradation of the platinum compound and enhanced biological activity and potency. These results suggest that this class of platinum compounds exerts its biological activity through the formation of active intermediates in situ within the lipid bilayers and that the activation reaction is highly dependent on the presence of DMPG and the size of the lipophilic leaving group.","['Perez-Soler, R', 'Khokhar, A R']","['Perez-Soler R', 'Khokhar AR']","['Departmentof Medical Oncology (Section of Head, Neck, and Thoracic Medical Oncology), University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Phosphatidylglycerols)', '113427-19-3 (bis-neodecanoato-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum(II))', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', 'BI71WT9P3R (dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol)', 'U86ZGC74V5 (Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Biotransformation', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers/pharmacology', 'Drug Stability', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lipid Bilayers/pharmacology', 'Lipids/pharmacology', 'Liposomes/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Phosphatidylglycerols/pharmacology', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Nov 15;52(22):6341-7.,,,,,,,"['CA41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45423/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Durkin et al., Blood, 79: 1161-1171, 1992) the isolation of a human differentiation-inhibiting protein (DIP) which selectively inhibits and blocks the differentiation of erythroid burst-forming unit progenitor cells in bone marrow colony assay, and the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced differentiation of cultured murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. DIP blocks MEL cell differentiation directly, without affecting the ability of the cells to proliferate. In the present study, DIP (at < 1 ng/ml) inhibited MEL cell differentiation only when added to the culture medium within 1 h after DMSO induction, indicating that it blocked an early, critical step in erythroleukemia cell differentiation. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor H-7 also maximally inhibited the differentiation of MEL cells during this same period following induction, suggesting that DIP may have blocked an early PKC-dependent process. Indeed, DIP was found to abolish a transient increase in membrane PKC activity which was triggered in MEL cells within 10-30 min after DMSO addition. This increase in membrane PKC activity resulted from the activation of an inactive pool of PKC residing on membranes, and not from the translocation of cytosolic PKC to membranes. DMSO also stimulated membrane PKC activity and differentiation in human erythroleukemia cells and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. As was the case with MEL cells, DIP prevented the early activation of PKC and the differentiation of human erythroleukemia cells. However, it did not inhibit the early increase in PKC activity in HL-60 cells or the subsequent differentiation of these cells. These results suggest that DIP blocks erythroleukemia cell differentiation by inhibiting an early and critical activation of inactive membrane PKC.","['Durkin, J P', 'Chakravarthy, B', 'Tremblay, R', 'Jouishomme, H', 'Whitfield, J F', 'Biquard, J M', 'Krsmanovic, V']","['Durkin JP', 'Chakravarthy B', 'Tremblay R', 'Jouishomme H', 'Whitfield JF', 'Biquard JM', 'Krsmanovic V']","['Cell Signals Group, Institute for Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (erythropoiesis inhibiting factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Nov 15;52(22):6329-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preexposure of cells to 10 nM bryostatin 1 for 24 h, followed by an additional 24-h incubation with 10 microM ara-C, resulted in greater than additive inhibitory effects toward clonogenic HL-60 cells. In a series of alkaline elution assays, cells preincubated with bryostatin 1 and prelabeled with [3H]thymidine exhibited a significant increase in DNA fragmentation following exposure to ara-C in comparison to cells exposed to ara-C alone. This increase in DNA damage was apparent at both neutral and alkaline pH and was not protein associated. In contrast, studies using cells pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine immediately before analysis suggested that bryostatin 1 pretreatment did not increase the ability of ara-C to interfere with DNA replicative intermediates. Additional studies demonstrated that the increase in DNA fragmentation induced by bryostatin 1 and ara-C preceded both loss of cell membrane integrity (as determined by trypan blue exclusion) as well as depletion of intracellular ATP and NAD pools. Furthermore, the enhanced inhibitory effects of bryostatin 1 and ara-C toward clonogenic HL-60 cells did not appear to result from the induction of cellular differentiation. Finally, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA obtained from cells exposed to both bryostatin 1 and ara-C revealed a pattern of integer multiples of 180- to 200-base pair fragments commonly associated with endonucleolytic cleavage; the extent of this fragmentation was considerably greater than that observed in cells exposed to ara-C alone. Taken together, these findings suggest that exposure of HL-60 cells to bryostatin 1 renders them more susceptible to ara-C-related DNA damage and that this phenomenon contributes to the cytotoxic effects of this drug combination. They also raise the possibility that bryostatin 1, perhaps through modulation of intracellular signaling events in leukemic cells, has the capacity to potentiate ara-C-related apoptosis or programmed cell death.","['Grant, S', 'Jarvis, W D', 'Swerdlow, P S', 'Turner, A J', 'Traylor, R S', 'Wallace, H J', 'Lin, P S', 'Pettit, G R', 'Gewirtz, D A']","['Grant S', 'Jarvis WD', 'Swerdlow PS', 'Turner AJ', 'Traylor RS', 'Wallace HJ', 'Lin PS', 'Pettit GR', 'Gewirtz DA']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lactones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Macrolides', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Nov 15;52(22):6270-8.,,,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun']",,,"['CA 44344-03A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09564-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Enrichment with docosahexaenoic acid increased the sensitivity to the thioether lipid BM 41.440, compared to control cells enriched with oleic acid. The effect was dependent upon drug concentration, time, and the extent of cellular fatty acid enrichment. Other polyunsaturated fatty acids had a similar effect, which was proportional to the degree of unsaturation of the molecule inserted. Depletion of cellular glutathione with buthionine sulfoximine increased the sensitivity to ether lipid, but prooxidants such as Fe2+ and antioxidants such as vitamin E had little effect. The addition of serum to the incubation medium markedly diminished the cytotoxicity of ether lipids for cells modified with both docosahexaenoic acid and oleic acid, probably due to binding of the drug to serum components. The toxicity of another ether lipid, 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine, was not affected appreciably by membrane alteration. Drug uptake studies with a radiolabeled BM 41.440 analogue, 1-[3H]hexadecylthio-2-ethyl-rac- glycero-3-phosphocholine, demonstrated no difference in transport at early time points and no difference in accumulation up to 60 min. We conclude that increases in cellular and/or membrane fatty acid polyunsaturation heighten the cytotoxic effect of a membrane-active ether lipid. The effect is not due to a change in drug transport or accumulation. It may be related to a change in oxidative events. These observations provide further confirmation of the membrane being the target of ether lipid action, using biochemical rather than morphological techniques. Most importantly, this observation offers a potential innovative approach to therapy.","['Petersen, E S', 'Kelley, E E', 'Modest, E J', 'Burns, C P']","['Petersen ES', 'Kelley EE', 'Modest EJ', 'Burns CP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '103304-64-9 (1-thiohexadecyl-2-ethyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '5ZZK34MC3V (ilmofosine)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Glutathione/deficiency', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phospholipid Ethers/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Nov 15;52(22):6263-9.,,,,,,,"['CA31526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR59/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that acute myelogenous leukemia cells have elevated receptor-mediated uptake of low density lipoproteins (LDL), compared to normal WBC. High receptor-mediated uptake of LDL by certain cancer cells in tissue culture and experimental tumors in animals in vivo has also been demonstrated. The present study was undertaken to compare the in vivo assimilation of LDL by human lung cancer tissue with that by surrounding lung tissue. Ten patients with newly diagnosed lung tumors, scheduled for surgery, received an i.v. injection of [14C]sucrose-labeled LDL. Following cellular uptake and degradation of the LDL particle, the radiolabeled sucrose moiety remains trapped in the lysosomal compartment, making this labeling technique useful for in vivo studies of tissue uptake of LDL. Radioactivity was determined in plasma and in tissue biopsies obtained at surgery 1-3 days after injection. The uptake of radioactivity in lung cancer tissue was elevated (1.5-3.0-fold), compared to surrounding tissue, in 7 of 9 patients with primary lung cancer. The most rapid preoperative disappearance of radioactivity from plasma was found in 2 patients with large tumors exhibiting high LDL uptake, relative to normal lung tissue. These findings support the hypothesis that the selectivity of cytotoxic agents can be enhanced also in nonhematological malignancies by administering the drugs incorporated in LDL particles.","['Vitols, S', 'Peterson, C', 'Larsson, O', 'Holm, P', 'Aberg, B']","['Vitols S', 'Peterson C', 'Larsson O', 'Holm P', 'Aberg B']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '57-50-1 (Sucrose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sucrose/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Nov 15;52(22):6244-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results indicate that FISH could be clinically valuable in five major areas: 1) marker chromosome identification; 2) identification of trisomy consistent with certain specific hematological neoplasms; 3) clonal evaluation post observation of a single cell with trisomy; 4) clonal evaluation post-sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT); and 5) residual disease detection following clinical remission.","['Chen, Z', 'Morgan, R', 'Berger, C S', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Chen Z', 'Morgan R', 'Berger CS', 'Sandberg AA']","['Cancer Center of Southwest Biomedical Research Institute and Genetrix, Inc., Scottsdale, Arizona 85251.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Probes)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Probes', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*genetics']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1992 Oct 1;63(1):62-9. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(92)90066-h.,,"['0165-4608(92)90066-H [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(92)90066-h [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, this led us to assume that the phenotype of blast cells may be determined by a chromosome abnormality. A phenotypic conversion from myeloblastic to undifferentiated morphologic aspect was observed when t(9;11) was detected, suggesting that t(9;11) may have induced a loss in differentiation of blast cells affected by this change.

FUrd was employed such that little DNA-directed cytotoxicity was seen. Substantial inhibition of cellular proliferation was observed at concentrations of FUrd which did not inhibit significantly the activity of thymidylate synthase and which were reversed by less than 10% by exogenous thymidine. In contrast, the syntheses of both poly A- and poly A+ RNAs were substantially reduced. The effects of FUrd on rRNA included reduction by greater than 90% of mature rRNA following a 2 h exposure to 1 microM FUrd, which persisted for at least 48 h, and the appearance of partially processed nuclear rRNA precursors incapable of being metabolized to mature rRNA. FUrd also decreased the levels of several mRNAs, including those for the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-abl, and for gamma-globin, by 40 to 70%. In contrast to the effects of FUrd on rRNA, decreases in mRNA levels were reversible, and within 12 h following a 2 h exposure to 1 microM FUrd, mRNA levels for each of these three mRNAs were back to those present in untreated control cells. mRNAs did not respond in a connected fashion to FUrd. Thus, levels of beta-actin mRNA were unchanged and levels of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA were increased by exposure to FUrd. These findings demonstrate that FUrd acted in multifarious ways to alter mRNA synthesis and longevity. Inhibitors of individual RNA polymerases were used to analyze the degree to which the FUrd-induced inhibition of RNA metabolism was linked to cytotoxicity. Both actinomycin D, which specifically interfered with the incorporation of FUrd into rRNA transcripts, and alpha-amanitin, which specifically inhibited incorporation of FUrd into mRNA transcripts, decreased the cytotoxicity of FUrd, suggesting that incorporation of FUrd into both mRNA and rRNA precursors plays a role in the RNA-directed cytotoxic actions of FUrd. However, the antagonism provided by actinomycin D was greater than that produced by alpha-amanitin, demonstrating that inhibition of rRNA synthesis is the predominant mechanism of cytotoxicity in K-562 cells exposed to FUrd.","['Heimer, R', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Heimer R', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 18S)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 28S)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '4K0M952561 (5-fluorouridine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/physiology', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/genetics', 'Poly A/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1992 May;12(4):221-39.,,,,['c-myc'],,,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The children were followed by clinical evaluations and computed tomographic (CT) brain scans. Two CNS treatment techniques were used. Eleven patients received intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate; 16 patients received 18-30 Gy of cranial radiation therapy in addition to systemic chemotherapy. The time interval between the CNS treatment and MR scans varied from 9 months to 4 years 8 months. RESULTS: Four of the 27 children (15%) showed white matter changes on the MR scans attributable to therapy, but only one had hypodensity on CT. Three of the 16 children (19%) receiving radiation therapy in addition to chemotherapy had white matter changes. One of the 11 patients (9%) from the group receiving only chemotherapy did so. The difference between the two treatment groups was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation therapy or chemotherapy (alone or in combination) may have been responsible for the white matter changes. MR imaging is a sensitive detector of white matter changes in children with ALL, but its value and significance during follow-up should be assessed in well-designed longitudinal research studies.","['Paakko, E', 'Vainionpaa, L', 'Lanning, M', 'Laitinen, J', 'Pyhtinen, J']","['Paakko E', 'Vainionpaa L', 'Lanning M', 'Laitinen J', 'Pyhtinen J']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Oulu University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Dec 1;70(11):2728-33. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921201)70:11<2728::aid-cncr2820701126>3.0.co;2-7.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19921201)70:11<2728::aid-cncr2820701126>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MBA-15 cells modulate growth of normal and malignant myeloid and lymphoid cells as well as leukemia cell lines in vitro. Cell-cell interactions were studied in co-cultures with adherent MBA-15 cells and the target hemopoietic cells. Growth inhibition effects, observed under various experimental conditions, can be attributed to the presence of different soluble and membrane-bound inhibitory activities produced by MBA-15 cells. Thus, MBA-15 cells spontaneously produce both stimulators and inhibitors that can affect myeloid and lymphoid cell growth.

Laboratory studies in the second patient disclosed the presence of lytic activity against both K562 and autologous CML cells that enhanced with IL2. Correlation with serial immunophenotyping data from this patient suggests that the effector for this graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction could have been a T lymphocyte.

This pilot study explored the use of prophylactic ursodiol in an attempt to decrease the incidence and severity of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Between February 1991 and January 1992, 22 consecutive patients undergoing BMT for hematologic malignancies received the BU(4)/CY(2) preparative regimen and CSA/MTX for GVHD prophylaxis. Ursodiol, 600-900 mg daily by mouth was begun at least 1 day prior to beginning the preparative regimen. Results for this pilot group were compared to a control group of 28 consecutive patients transplanted between June 1989 and January 1991 with the same regimen without ursodiol. There were no significant differences in disease or clinical status between the groups pretransplant. However, mean baseline AST levels were significantly higher in the ursodiol group, 28.0 U/l vs 18.1 U/l in the control group (p = 0.001). The median maximum bilirubin observed post-transplant was 2.35 mg/dl (range 0.9-45) in the ursodiol group, and 5.05 mg/dl (range 0.7-29.4) in controls. The incidence of VOD was 2/22 (9.1%) in the ursodiol group and 18/28 (64.3%) in controls (p = 0.0001).

With this technique, the light (L) chain of a monoclonal Ig usually appears as a single spot. Thus, the degree of clonal diversity of the functional B cells can be appreciated by the electrophoretic pattern of the serum L chains. Furthermore, 2D-PAGE allows a semi-quantitative determination of prominent Ig clones according to the size of L chain spots. We found that serum electrophoretograms of 8/19 patients after BMT (5-9 months) revealed L chain patterns which were similar to those of normal polyclonal Igs, that is, less than five distinguishable small spots among a cloud-like indiscrete L chain spots region ('polyclonal' pattern). A spectrum of clonal abnormalities was observed on the electrophoretograms of 11/19 patients: in five patients, multiple small L chain spots (corresponding to Ig concentrations between 0.2 and 2 g/l) were detected ('oligoclonal' pattern), whereas in six others, 'typical' monoclonal Igs (Ig concentrations > 2 g/l) were observed with (3/19 patients) or without (3/19 patients) multiple small clonal components. Sequential analysis of serum obtained from patients at different times after BMT revealed that imbalanced clonal reconstitution was transient and evolved towards apparently normal polyclonal Ig production. Our observations show that the development of clonal 'gammopathies' after BMT is a frequent, but not obligatory phenomenon. It may reflect a transient restriction of the B cell repertoire either through a limited outgrowth of precursor cells or through selective antigenic pressures.","['Tissot, J D', 'Helg, C', 'Chapuis, B', 'Zubler, R H', 'Jeannet, M', 'Hochstrasser, D F', 'Hohlfeld, P', 'Schneider, P']","['Tissot JD', 'Helg C', 'Chapuis B', 'Zubler RH', 'Jeannet M', 'Hochstrasser DF', 'Hohlfeld P', 'Schneider P']","['Centre de Transfusion Sanguine CRS, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Antibody Diversity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/*immunology', 'Dysgammaglobulinemia/*etiology/immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/blood', 'Immunoglobulins/*blood', 'Leukemia/immunology/surgery', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Oct;10(4):347-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence (8/29: 28%) of skin lesions in chronic GVHD was low in contrast to the previously reported high incidence (79-90%). Cutaneous manifestations in six out of eight patients with chronic GVHD tended to be mild, and lichen-planus-like eruptions in the skin and scleroderma-like lesions, which are well known as representative cutaneous manifestations of chronic GVHD, were rare. Furthermore, our statistical analysis indicated that there was no relationship between pretransplant total body irradiation and GVHD prophylaxis or acute GVHD and the onset of chronic cutaneous GVHD.

Although recent research has focused on PCP in AIDS patients, few studies have described the clinical presentation of PCP in recipients of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Between 1976 and 1991, of 1454 BMT patients at the University of Minnesota, PCP was documented in only 19. Eighteen of these had not been receiving PCP prophylaxis. Patients presented with a brief period (2-10 days) of symptoms including dyspnea, cough, and fever in greater than 75% of patients, but had only scant abnormal physical findings. Chest X-rays showed bilateral infiltrates in 58% of all patients, though 15% had no or minimal X-ray findings. Bronchoscopic alveolar lavage confirmed the diagnosis most often, but 13% of lavages were negative and required biopsy for the diagnosis. High dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the initial treatment for 84% of the patients though 25% of these patients were later switched to pentamidine due to poor response or hypersensitivity reactions. Despite prompt diagnosis and therapy, overall survival was poor, with only 37% of patients surviving pneumonitis. Patients developing PCP less than 6 months post-BMT had greater mortality (89%) versus only 40% in later onset PCP (p less than 0.0001). Despite this better survival in the late-onset PCP cohort, the development of pneumonitis in these patients underscores the necessity for continued PCP prophylaxis beyond 1 year in some patients. Ongoing immunocompromise and need for prophylaxis should be appreciated in patients with graft-versus-host disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Tuan, I Z', 'Dennison, D', 'Weisdorf, D J']","['Tuan IZ', 'Dennison D', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '25W8454H16 (Sulfamethizole)', '79735-35-6 (trimethoprim sulfamethizole)', 'AN164J8Y0X (Trimethoprim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Sulfamethizole/therapeutic use', 'Trimethoprim/therapeutic use']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Sep;10(3):267-72.,,,,,,,['CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

To ascertain the association between myeloid antigens on the BC and the L-CFC from the same patient, we compared the expression of CD14, CD15, CD33, p124 and HLA class I from 17 cases of AML. These particular myeloid antigens were studied because they are suitable targets in purging bone marrow for autotransplantation. We found no significant difference in the expression of CD14, CD15, CD33, and HLA class I on the BC and L-CFC from the same patient, although we observed considerable heterogeneity among different AML cases. Analysis of the progenitor cell antigen p124 revealed significant within-patient differences on the BC and L-CFC (p = 0.007), with a greater tendency for expression on the L-CFC. This heterogeneity may be due to differences in maturation stage of the L-CFC and BC.

We found that the relative percentage of 'total' (gamma/delta+ T lymphocytes) (V delta 2 + V delta 1 positive cells), and particularly of G1+ (V delta 2+) cells, in CD3+ lymphocytes was higher in transplanted patients, and especially in those presenting with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), than in normal controls.

Similarly, the absolute number of 'total' gamma/delta+ and V delta 2+ cells was also significantly increased in patients with aGVHD. TCR gamma/delta+ T cells increased as a function of time after BMT reaching a plateau value at about day 60 post-BMT. When patients were stratified for the presence or absence of aGVHD this correlation was maintained only for patients with aGVHD.

DESIGN: Follow up of 29 consecutive children starting maintenance chemotherapy, with parental interview and count of all melanocytic naevi > or = 2 mm on the child's skin. Assessment repeated three years later after completion of maintenance chemotherapy. Other dermatological problems identified at either visit were also recorded. SETTING: Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow. RESULTS: At the start of maintenance chemotherapy all children had total body counts of melanocytic naevi within the normal range established for age matched children in the local population. Three years later total body naevus counts were significantly increased, the median increase being 66 naevi per child (95% confidence interval 57 to 94). The only other problem noted in these children was relatively poor regrowth of scalp hair. CONCLUSION: Children on maintenance chemotherapy for haematological malignancies develop an excessive number of melanocytic naevi. Excessive numbers of melanocytic naevi are the most important risk factor for melanoma in the general population. These children should have periodic skin examinations at their follow up visits, and both child and parent should be educated about clinical features of early melanoma.","['Baird, E A', 'McHenry, P M', 'MacKie, R M']","['Baird EA', 'McHenry PM', 'MacKie RM']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Glasgow, Royal Hospital for Sick Children.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Nevus, Pigmented/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*chemically induced/pathology']",1992/10/03 00:00,1992/10/03 00:01,['1992/10/03 00:00'],"['1992/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1992 Oct 3;305(6857):799-801. doi: 10.1136/bmj.305.6857.799.,,['10.1136/bmj.305.6857.799 [doi]'],,,,PMC1883498,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first report describing the use of alkylating agents in clinical practice the problem of drug resistance was recognised. In spite of this there is still comparatively little known about the mechanisms underlying the development of resistance as it occurs in patients. Studies using animal models and cell lines have suggested that both cellular and extracellular factors may be involved, but the precise relevance of these to the clinical setting is unclear.

The requirements of these cells for proliferation have been studied both in clonogenic assays in semi-solid media and in liquid suspension culture. These have demonstrated that AML clonogenic cells from the majority of patients, can be stimulated to proliferate by colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL-3) as well as other cytokines including interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, all of which are known to stimulate normal haemopoietic progenitors. Unlike normal haemopoietic cells, leukaemic blasts from many patients with AML express transcripts for haemopoietic growth factors including GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL-1 but not IL-3, and secrete growth factor protein. When leukaemic cells are cultured at sufficiently high density to permit cell-cell interactions, autonomous growth of clonogenic cells can be seen. Autonomous growth is related to the autocrine secretion of haemopoietic growth factors including GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL-6. The degree of autonomous colony growth is variable but approximately 70% of AML samples exhibit either partial or totally autonomous growth; the remaining cells being absolutely dependent on exogenous CSF or fail to grow in the culture systems employed.

For a more precise definition of the location of Odc-rs8 relative to Igh-V, DNAs from 17 Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed pre-B cell lines cultured from mice heterozygous at Igh and Odc-rs8 were analyzed for the presence of DNA restriction fragments (RFs) derived from each parental Odc-rs8 allele. These cell lines, each of which has rearranged one or both Igh genes, previously were employed in mapping members of nine VH gene families by deletion analysis (Brodeur et al. 1988). Comparing the deletion profiles of the cell lines for Odc-rs8 with those for the VH gene families has located Odc-rs8b within the VHJ558/VH3609 gene cluster and Odc-rs8c either within or upstream of the 5'-most 9% of VHJ558, identifying Odc-rs8 as a potentially useful marker for the 5' end of the Igh complex.","['Richards-Smith, B A', 'Brodeur, P H', 'Elliott, R W']","['Richards-Smith BA', 'Brodeur PH', 'Elliott RW']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mamm Genome,Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society,9100916,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*genetics', '*Pseudogenes']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mamm Genome. 1992;3(10):568-74. doi: 10.1007/BF00350623.,,['10.1007/BF00350623 [doi]'],,"['Igh-V', 'Odc-rs8']",,,"['GM28464/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HG00342/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we report our identification of the site of attachment of the O-linked oligosaccharides in the receptor. A 70 kDa fragment from the external domain of the TfR was generated by trypsin treatment of the [3H]glucosamine-labelled receptor purified from human K562 cells. The beta-elimination of the intact TfR, but not the 70 kDa fragment, released Gal-[3H]Gal-NAcitol, indicating that the 70 kDa fragment lacks O-linked oligosaccharides. In the remaining 20 kDa fragment there are three potential sites (Thr96, Thr104 and Ser106) for O-glycosylation in the extracellular domain. To identify which of these residues are O-glycosylated, both the [3H]Thr- and [3H]Ser-labelled TfR were directly treated with mild base to effect beta-elimination, and the radiolabelled amino acids and their derivatives were analysed. Approximately 2% of the total radiolabelled Thr, but no radiolabelled Ser, was converted to expected beta-elimination products by this treatment. These and other results demonstrate that only one O-linked oligosaccharide is present in the TfR and that it occurs on either Thr96 or Thr104. From human serum we purified the cleaved, soluble form of the TfR (s-TfR), which contains Thr104, but lacks Thr96. The s-TfR was sensitive to O-glycanase and bound to Jacalin lectin, indicating that the s-TfR contains an O-linked oligosaccharide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Do, S I', 'Cummings, R D']","['Do SI', 'Cummings RD']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Georgia, Athens 30602.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Binding Sites', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligosaccharides/*analysis', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*analysis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Threonine/*analysis', 'Trypsin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 1992 Aug;2(4):345-53. doi: 10.1093/glycob/2.4.345.,,['10.1093/glycob/2.4.345 [doi]'],,,,,['CA37626/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

It decomposes spontaneously to the active metabolite of DTIC (MTIC). Temozolomide is more cytotoxic against L1210 than against a subline L1210/BCNU, resistant to chloroethylnitrosoureas. Using [methyl-3H] temozolomide we found that after 1 h exposure the amount of O6-methylguanine (O6mGua) was twice as high in L1210 than in L1210/BCNU whereas the amount of N7 mGua was approximately the same in the two cell lines. O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AT) levels were higher in L1210/BCNU than in L1210, supporting the view that the resistance to methyltriazenes is probably related to the efficient repair of O6mGua in L1210/BCNU. Exposure of L1210/BCNU cells to 0.4 mM O6mGua for 24 h resulted in a depletion of AT and in a higher temozolomide-induced cytotoxicity. In the sensitive cell line L1210, temozolomide activity was not potentiated by O6mGua pretreatment. Moreover, in L1210/BCNU, O6mGua increased DNA single-strand breaks caused by temozolomide, suggesting that O6-guanine alkylation induces an excision repair mechanism in cells depleted in AT.","['Taverna, P', 'Catapano, C V', 'Citti, L', 'Bonfanti, M', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Taverna P', 'Catapano CV', 'Citti L', 'Bonfanti M', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Alkalies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '9B710FV2AE (O-(6)-methylguanine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Alkalies', 'Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/pharmacology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1992 Aug;3(4):401-5. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199208000-00014.,,['10.1097/00001813-199208000-00014 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lower incidence of BU-associated toxicities and lower therapeutic effectiveness in young children given BU doses based on body weight (ie, 16 mg/kg) is associated with altered pharmacokinetics of BU; the area under the curve (AUC) of BU concentration versus time is significantly less in these patients than those observed in older children and adults. To optimize BU dosage in young BMT recipients, we developed a dosage regimen based on body surface area (BSA) and determined BU pharmacokinetics and BU-associated toxicities. Seven children (median age, 3.9 years, range, 1.1 to 5.7) undergoing allogeneic or autologous BMT for leukemia received 40 mg/m2/dose BU every 6 hours for 16 doses; BU concentrations were measured in the plasma, and AUCs were determined for each patient after the first and 13th doses. Expressed as a function of body weight, the median BU dosage was 26.4 mg/kg (range, 24.3 to 28.2), a 60% increase over the BU dosage based on body weight. Four patients developed mucositis, and one of them also developed nonfatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). No patients receiving 40 mg/m2 BU developed neurotoxicity (eg, seizures) or interstitial pneumonitis. Prompt and sustained engraftment was observed in the allogeneic BMT recipients, and late graft failure was not seen. The mean BU AUCs were 1,105 mumol/L.min (range, 790 to 2,080) after the first dose and 1,022 mumol/L.min (range, 632 to 1,860) after the 13th dose of BU, comparable to the AUCs in adults given 16 mg/kg of BU. These studies suggest that, in young children, BSA-based dosing of BU (40 mg/m2) provides drug exposures (AUCs) closer to adult values with acceptable toxicities and may improve therapeutic effects.","['Yeager, A M', 'Wagner, J E Jr', 'Graham, M L', 'Jones, R J', 'Santos, G W', 'Grochow, L B']","['Yeager AM', 'Wagner JE Jr', 'Graham ML', 'Jones RJ', 'Santos GW', 'Grochow LB']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male']",1992/11/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/11/11 19:15'],"['1992/11/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/11/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2425-8.,,['S0006-4971(20)79340-7 [pii]'],,,,,"['CM07302/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA54203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Most mature T lymphocytes specifically recognize antigens through the alpha/beta T-cell receptor (TCR). Each alpha/beta TCR chain includes a constant region and a variable region, the latter being encoded by V-J alpha or V-D-J beta rearranged gene segments. To better characterize T cells involved in GVHD, V alpha and V beta gene segment usage was analyzed, after cDNA amplification, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and skin samples from three patients with grade II cutaneous GVHD. At time of GVHD diagnosis (days 11, 22, and 25), when first signs of engraftment were detectable, virtually all V alpha and V beta subfamilies were represented in PBMC RNAs of the three recipients. These results suggest that diversified TCR gene segment expression is observed early after allogenic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT). Lymphocytes infiltrating GVHD skin also expressed a large series of V alpha and V beta subfamily specificities. However, analysis of the V alpha and V beta amplified products showed substantial differences between PBMC and the skin lymphocyte RNAs. These observations indicate that a large variety of T lymphocytes are present at the disease site, while some of them may be specifically amplified or decreased in response to minor histocompatibility antigens (miHA). Further characterization of the latter T-cell subpopulations should lead to a better understanding of human in vivo responses directed at miHA.","['Dietrich, P Y', 'Caignard, A', 'Diu, A', 'Genevee, C', 'Pico, J L', 'Henry-Amar, M', 'Bosq, J', 'Angevin, E', 'Triebel, F', 'Hercend, T']","['Dietrich PY', 'Caignard A', 'Diu A', 'Genevee C', 'Pico JL', 'Henry-Amar M', 'Bosq J', 'Angevin E', 'Triebel F', 'Hercend T']","['Hemato-Immunology Unit, INSERM U333, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genetic Variation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Skin/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2419-24.,,['S0006-4971(20)79339-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While phase I through III clinical trials showed the enhancing activity of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) on neutrophil recovery after ABMT with unpurged marrow, controversial results have been reported when purged marrow was used. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to evaluate the efficacy of rhGM-CSF administration in a group of patients (n = 15) with lymphoid malignancies transplanted in complete remission with mafosfamide-purged (n = 10) or unpurged (n = 5) marrow. Mafosfamide concentrations used for marrow purging were evaluated on an individual basis by means of a recently described technique that destroys the granulocyte-macrophage (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units [CFU-GM]) compartment, but spares 50% of the more primitive stroma adherent colony-forming cells (CFU-Blast). rhGM-CSF (10 micrograms/kg/d) was started within 24 hours of ABMT and administered in a 4-hour infusion daily until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reached 500 x 10(6)/L and then for 7 more days. Patients receiving mafosfamide-purged or unpurged marrow failed to show any difference in terms of median number of days required to achieve an ANC > or = 500 x 10(6) (13 v 14.0, P > .4) cells/L.

Recently, we and others showed that almost 20% of cALL cases are characterized by further recombination of V delta 2(D)D delta 3 segments to J alpha elements, thereby deleting the TCR delta locus in analogy to the delta Rec/psi J alpha pathway in differentiating alpha/beta-positive T cells. We report here that two human cALL-derived cell lines, REH and Nalm-6, are competent to recombine the TCR delta/alpha locus under standard tissue culture conditions. Analysis of different REH subclones obtained by limiting dilution of the initial culture showed a biased recombination of V delta 2D delta 3 to distinct J alpha elements. During prolonged tissue culture, a subclone acquired growth advantage and displaced parental cells as well as other subclones. Frequently, the DJ junctions of REH subclones contained extended stretches of palindromic sequences derived from modified D delta 3 coding elements. The other cell line, Nalm-6, started the TCR delta/alpha recombination with an unusual signal joint of a cryptic recombinase signal sequence (RSS) upstream of D delta 3 to the 3' RSS of D delta 3. The RSS dimer was subsequently rearranged in all investigated subclones to an identical J alpha element. Both cell lines might become valuable tools to unravel the complex regulation of TCR delta/alpha recombination pathways in malignant and normal lymphopoiesis.","['Hansen-Hagge, T E', 'Yokota, S', 'Reuter, H J', 'Schwarz, K', 'Bartram, C R']","['Hansen-Hagge TE', 'Yokota S', 'Reuter HJ', 'Schwarz K', 'Bartram CR']","['Department of Pediatrics II, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2353-62.,,['S0006-4971(20)79330-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that two of these single-chain recombinant immunotoxins, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL and DT388-anti-Tac(Fv), are cytotoxic toward peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL, anti-Tac(Fv) is genetically fused to the amino terminus of PE40KDEL, a recombinant form of PE which contains amino acids 253-608 of PE and the -KDEL mutation at the carboxyl terminus. In DT388-anti-Tac(Fv), anti-Tac(Fv) is fused to the carboxyl terminus of the first 388 amino acids of DT. PBMCs from 14 patients were incubated with the recombinant toxins for 60 hours, and [3H]-leucine incorporation was measured. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL was cytotoxic to 7 of the 14 patient samples, with half-maximal inhibition of protein synthesis (IC50) achieved at 1.2 to 9 ng/mL (1.8 to 13 x 10(-11) mol/L). DT388-anti-Tac(Fv) was cytotoxic to 11 of the 14 samples, with IC50s ranging from less than 1 to 250 ng/mL. DT388-IL-2, in which the first 388 amino acids of DT are attached to IL-2, was marginally cytotoxic toward only 4 of 13 CLL samples tested with IC50s ranging from 100 to 550 ng/mL. Trypan blue staining of cells from several patients indicated that inhibition of protein synthesis correlated with cell death. Binding assays using [3H]-anti-Tac indicated that the CLL cells from nine of the patients contained between 400 and 2,500 sites per cell. Cells from another patient, which were resistant to both anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL and DT388-anti-Tac(Fv), had less than 100 sites per cell. We conclude that anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL and DT388-anti-Tac(Fv) can kill CLL cells which have low numbers of IL-2 receptors, and should be investigated further for therapy of this disease.","['Kreitman, R J', 'Chaudhary, V K', 'Kozak, R W', 'FitzGerald, D J', 'Waldman, T A', 'Pastan, I']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Chaudhary VK', 'Kozak RW', 'FitzGerald DJ', 'Waldman TA', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Exotoxins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virulence Factors']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2344-52.,,['S0006-4971(20)79329-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PAM from Patient 1, a patient in chronic phase studied before bone marrow transplantation (BMT), contained the Ph by Southern blot analysis. Patient 2, an accelerated phase patient, was studied after post-BMT relapse. PAM from this patient not only contained the Ph, but also expressed the BCR/ABL message documented by a new splice junction in situ hybridization technique. This new technique allows detection of BCR/ABL mRNA and determination of splice useage in individual cells.

To study isotype-switched B-CLL as a potentially more differentiated variant, we performed genetic and functional immunoglobulin (Ig) gene analysis in two cases of CD5+ B-CLL in which the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) secreted predominantly IgA (CLL-249) or IgG (CLL-412) when stimulated with pokeweed mitogen in vitro. By cDNA sequencing and by studies of CLL-heterohybridomas, CLL-249 expresses the heavy chain constant region C alpha as anticipated, while CLL-412 expresses C mu, not C gamma. In CLL-249, the expressed VH gene is 98% homologous to VH26, a germline VH3 gene that occurs frequently in the fetal repertoire, and which has been associated with anti-DNA specificity. The VL gene of CLL-249 is a lambda VL gene for which the germline sequence is not known. In CLL-412, the VH gene is 100% homologous to the VH1 gene of a published anti-DNA antibody (21/28), and is probably a germline gene sequence; the VL gene is 100% homologous to 15AVKI, also a germline gene. The supernatant antibody of the CLL-412 heterohybridoma is an IgM-kappa, which reacts with ssDNA and cardiolipin. The CLL-249 heterohybridoma secreted IgA-lambda, which bound none of the antigens tested, a finding that may be related to amino acid differences from the probable germline V genes. The demonstration of an in vivo isotype-switched variant, such as CLL-249, suggests that B-CLL may be a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders, of which less common variants may have features of more differentiated B-cell stages, such as isotype switching.","['Friedman, D F', 'Moore, J S', 'Erikson, J', 'Manz, J', 'Goldman, J', 'Nowell, P C', 'Silberstein, L E']","['Friedman DF', 'Moore JS', 'Erikson J', 'Manz J', 'Goldman J', 'Nowell PC', 'Silberstein LE']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cardiolipins/immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin A/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2287-97.,,['S0006-4971(20)79322-5 [pii]'],"['GENBANK/L01276', 'GENBANK/L01277', 'GENBANK/L01278', 'GENBANK/L01279', 'GENBANK/S72766', 'GENBANK/S72767', 'GENBANK/S72768', 'GENBANK/S72769', 'GENBANK/S72771', 'GENBANK/X63098']",,,,['R29DK39065-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Since recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhuGM-CSF) has proved to accelerate bone marrow recovery after cytostatic chemotherapy, we studied its effects on hematopoietic regeneration and on infectious complications after total body irradiation (TBI) and high-dose chemotherapy followed by ABMT. Eighty-one patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete remission (CR) or with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in CR or partial remission were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They received either rhuGM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2 (Escherichia coli-derived) daily by continuous infusion after ABMT, or placebo. Treatment was continued until the neutrophil counts reached greater than 500/microL for 1 week. The maximum treatment duration was 30 days. Thirty-nine patients in the rhuGM-CSF group and 40 patients in the placebo group were evaluable. The median time needed to reach a neutrophil count of 500/microL was 15 days with rhuGM-CSF and 28 days with placebo (P = .0001). Bacterial infections occurred in 14 (35.9%) of the patients with rhuGM-CSF and in 25 (62.5%) of the patients given the placebo (P = .024). Nine of the 14 bacterial infections in the rhuGM-CSF group and 20 of the 25 infections in the placebo group were diagnosed within the first 10 days after ABMT. Capillary leakage and a reversible fluid retention were seen in five of the rhuGM-CSF-treated patients. Patients treated with rhuGM-CSF had lower serum protein and albumin levels than patients in the placebo group. There was no statistically relevant difference in overall survival between the two groups (P = .47). Relapse occurred in 14 (34%) patients with rhuGM-CSF and in 18 (45%) patients with placebo.

Median age was 46 (range 25 to 63). No patient presented with leukocytes > 10 x 10(9)/L or had the microgranular APL variant. Cytogenetic analysis (25 patients) found a t(15;17) in 24 cases. Patients were scheduled to receive ATRA (45 mg/m2/d) until complete remission, followed by an intensive daunorubicin (DNR) + Ara C course (""4 + 7"" course), then three ""2 + 5"" DNR + Ara C courses and maintenance chemotheapy. However, the ""4 + 7"" course was administered in emergency if hyperleukocytosis rapidly developed to prevent leukostasis. Twenty-five patients (96%) achieved CR, 14 with ATRA alone and 11 after the addition of the ""4 + 7"" course on day 2 to 30 of treatment, because leukocytes rapidly increased (9 cases), because of resistance to ATRA (1 case), and development of organomegaly (1 case). The remaining patient died on day 6, from CNS bleeding. Apart from hyperleukocytosis, side effects were usually moderate. In the 11 patients who could be studied in vitro, a very good correlation was found between in vivo and vitro differentiation and proliferation of APL blasts with ATRA. Three patients were allografted after the ""4 + 7"" course. Four patients did not receive this course but received the subsequent ""2 + 5"" courses and maintenance. The remaining patients followed the scheduled protocol. Three patients relapsed after 8, 11, and 15 months (including one allografted patient). Two patients died in CR, after 6 and 17 months. The other 20 patients remained in CR after 18+ to 34+ months (median 21). Actuarial disease free interval (DFI) and event free survival (EFS) were 87% and 77%, respectively, after 18 months. These results were compared to those obtained in our previous APL 84 trial with chemotherapy alone in newly diagnosed APL (after excluding patients included in this trial who presented with hyperleukocytosis). In APL 84 trial, the CR rate was 76%, the actuarial DFI and EFS were 59% and 48% after 18 months, respectively. Differences with the pilot study of ATRA followed by chemotherapy were significant for DFI (P = .02), EFS (P = .006), but not for CR rate (P = .08). Although this is a historical comparison, these results suggest that ATRA followed by chemotherapy may prove superior to chemotherapy alone in newly diagnosed APL, by slightly increasing the CR rate, but perhaps more importantly by reducing the relapse rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Fenaux, P', 'Castaigne, S', 'Dombret, H', 'Archimbaud, E', 'Duarte, M', 'Morel, P', 'Lamy, T', 'Tilly, H', 'Guerci, A', 'Maloisel, F']","['Fenaux P', 'Castaigne S', 'Dombret H', 'Archimbaud E', 'Duarte M', 'Morel P', 'Lamy T', 'Tilly H', 'Guerci A', 'Maloisel F', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology Centre Hospitalier Univeriteire (CHU), Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoguazone/administration & dosage', 'Pilot Projects', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2176-81.,,['S0006-4971(20)79306-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-five patients (23%) developed acute GVHD and univariate analysis identified four features that significantly increased the risk for this reaction: chronic myeloid leukemia as the underlying disease, as compared with all other disease categories (P < .0001); female marrow donors for male recipients, as compared with other gender combinations (P < .005); ineffective, as compared with sustained growth suppression of intestinal anaerobic bacteria (P < .006); and methotrexate as the sole immunoprophylactic compound, as compared with cyclosporine containing regimens (P < .05). Using the duration of anaerobic growth suppression as a time-dependent explanatory variable, proportional hazards regression analysis confirmed these features as independent predictors for acute GVHD with relative risk estimates of 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.7) for the immunoprophylactic regimen (P < .0004), of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.5) for the underlying disease (P < .0005), of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.5) for anaerobic decontamination (P < .002), and of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6) for the donor/recipient gender combination (P < .008), respectively. Best subset selection modeling also identified the quality of anaerobic decontamination as the third most important predictor for acute GVHD, when all four significant features were included. Estimates of acute GVHD stratified by the quality of anaerobic bacterial growth suppression showed a strong influence of anaerobic decontamination in patients burdened by at least one of the other unfavorable factors (P < .009). In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence that sustained growth suppression of intestinal anaerobic bacteria after clinical sibling marrow transplantation can independently modulate the occurrence of grades II to IV acute GVHD, which is in concordance with previous results from animal transplantation models. Antimicrobial chemotherapy specifically targeted to the intestinal anaerobic bacterial microflora may be complementarily useful in preventing acute GVHD and should be investigated in a prospective trial.","['Beelen, D W', 'Haralambie, E', 'Brandt, H', 'Linzenmeier, G', 'Muller, K D', 'Quabeck, K', 'Sayer, H G', 'Graeven, U', 'Mahmoud, H K', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Beelen DW', 'Haralambie E', 'Brandt H', 'Linzenmeier G', 'Muller KD', 'Quabeck K', 'Sayer HG', 'Graeven U', 'Mahmoud HK', 'Schaefer UW']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital of Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacteria, Anaerobic/*drug effects/*growth & development', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Family', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Intestines/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Tissue Donors']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 15;80(10):2668-76.,,['S0006-4971(20)76681-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here show that synthesis of IL-6 by human mononuclear phagocytes exposed to recombinant human (rh) LIF is preceded by an increase of IL-6 transcript levels as a result of transcriptional activation of the IL-6 gene. Analysis of deleted fragments of the IL-6 promoter indicated that transcriptional activation of the IL-6 promoter was associated with enhanced binding activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. Binding of activation protein (AP)-1 and NF-IL-6, also known to transcriptionally activate the IL-6 promoter, was not inducible by LIF. Furthermore, introduction of the NF-kappa B sequence into a heterologous promoter construct, but not of AP-1- and NF-IL-6-binding sequences, conferred inducibility by LIF to this promoter. Deletion of the NF-kappa B binding site in the IL-6 promoter was associated with loss of inducibility by LIF, lending further support for the notion that the NF-kappa B binding site is crucial for LIF-mediated induction of the IL-6 promoter. Taken together, our results show that rhLIF induces IL-6 gene expression in mononuclear phagocytes through transcriptional gene activation involving NF-kappa B.","['Gruss, H J', 'Brach, M A', 'Herrmann, F']","['Gruss HJ', 'Brach MA', 'Herrmann F']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Growth Hormone/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phagocytes/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 15;80(10):2563-70.,,['S0006-4971(20)76666-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Blood. 1999 May 15;93(10):3573.

A cytoreductive prephase (prednisone/cyclophosphamide) was followed by eight 5-day courses of chemotherapy. Fractionated cyclophosphamide, methotrexate (MTX) 0.5 g/m2 (24-hour infusion), and MTX intrathecally were administered at each course and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C)/teniposide (VM-26) was given alternately with doxorubicin. In study ALL-BFM-83, central nervous system (CNS) chemotherapy was intensified by adding dexamethasone, while MTX/ARA-C was administered intraventricularly. Therapy duration was reduced to six courses. In study ALL-BFM-86, MTX 0.5 g/m2 was replaced by high-dose (HD) MTX, 5 g/m2 (24-hour infusion), and MTX/ARA-C/prednisolone intrathecal therapy was introduced. Doses of ARA-C and VM-26 were increased and fractionated, cyclophosphamide was partially replaced by ifosfamide, and vincristine was added. CNS irradiation was 24 Gy for prevention and 30 Gy for overt disease in studies ALL-BFM-81 and -83, but was omitted in ALL-BFM-86. In all, 87 patients were enrolled, 22 (8 CNS-positive) in study All-BFM-81, 24 (7 CNS-positive) in study ALL-BFM-83, and 41 (0 CNS-positive) in study ALL-BFM-86. The estimated 5-year duration of event-free survival (EFS) was 43% in study ALL-BFM 81, 50% in study ALL-BFM-83, and 78% in study ALL-BFM-86 (minimal follow-up, 25 months). Nineteen of 24 relapses occurred while on therapy or shortly thereafter. In study ALL-BFM 81, the CNS was the most frequent site of failure. In ALL-BFM-83, there were no isolated CNS relapses, but more bone marrow (BM) relapses occurred. In ALL-BFM-86, localized manifestations were the predominant site of failure, no isolated BM relapses occurred, and only one CNS relapse was diagnosed. No single parameter exerted a consistent influence on outcome with one exception. The presence of residual disease after the first two courses was correlated with an increased risk of therapy failure. We conclude that an intensive, short-pulse therapy delivered within a 4-month period is highly effective in the treatment of B-ALL. In addition to fractionated cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide, a 24-hour infusion of HD MTX 5 g/m2 in conjunction with an i.th. therapy is an important component for prevention of both systemic and CNS relapses. CNS irradiation is not needed for CNS-negative patients.","['Reiter, A', 'Schrappe, M', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Lampert, F', 'Harbott, J', 'Henze, G', 'Niemeyer, C M', 'Gadner, H', 'Muller-Weihrich, S', 'Ritter, J']","['Reiter A', 'Schrappe M', 'Ludwig WD', 'Lampert F', 'Harbott J', 'Henze G', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Gadner H', 'Muller-Weihrich S', 'Ritter J', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Remission Induction', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 15;80(10):2471-8.,,['S0006-4971(20)76655-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The values for patients with untreated acute myelocytic leukemia (AML, n = 18) and untreated acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n = 14) were 398 +/- 175 ng/ml and 479 +/- 176 ng/ml, respectively, both of which were significantly higher than those for the normal subjects (AML, p < 0.02; ALL, p < 0.05). When complete remission was achieved with initial remission induction therapy, s-TR decreased to 262 +/- 47 ng/ml (n = 22, 12 AML and 10 ALL), returning to normal levels. There was a good correlation between s-TR levels and the number of leukemic cells in peripheral blood (r = 0.743, n = 32, p < 0.01). In two patients with AML, serial changes of s-TR values and numbers of blast cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow occurred in a parallel manner. If, therefore, this assay for s-TR can be made more sensitive, it may become useful for assessing acute leukemia activity and for monitoring the effects of therapy.","['Kato, J', 'Kohgo, Y', 'Kondo, H', 'Nishisato, T', 'Sasaki, K', 'Tsushima, N', 'Hirayama, M', 'Fujikawa, K', 'Sintani, N', 'Miyazaki, E']","['Kato J', 'Kohgo Y', 'Kondo H', 'Nishisato T', 'Sasaki K', 'Tsushima N', 'Hirayama M', 'Fujikawa K', 'Sintani N', 'Miyazaki E', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*analysis', 'Reference Values']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Oct;56(2):161-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the expression of PKC in both highly purified leukemic T cells freshly isolated from adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients and control T lymphocytes obtained from healthy volunteers. PKC activity was decreased in the ATL cells as compared with the control T cells. Cytosolic PKC activity in the ATL cells was remarkably decreased, whereas particulate membrane PKC activity was similar to the control level. The percentage of PKC activity in the particulate fraction was 34% in the ATL cells and 19% in the control cells. Regarding the altered subcellular localization of PKC activity, phorbol ester-induced translocation of cytosolic PKC was inhibited in some ATL cases. Similarly to the decrease in PKC activity, there was a decrease in the expression of the major PKC isozymes II(beta) and III(alpha) in ATL cells. These results suggest impaired regulation of PKC expression in ATL as well as in many experimental cancers.","['Hidaka, M', 'Nakakuma, H', 'Kawaguchi, T', 'Nagakura, S', 'Horikawa, K', 'Okuno, Y', 'Kagimoto, T', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Hidaka M', 'Nakakuma H', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Nagakura S', 'Horikawa K', 'Okuno Y', 'Kagimoto T', 'Takatsuki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoenzymes/blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase C/*blood', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Oct;56(2):135-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of the N-RAS oncogene were identified in two of three patients investigated by in vivo selection assay and in five of ten patients investigated by PCR analysis of DNA from myeloma cells. In the two former patients, mutation of the N-RAS oncogene was observed at the 61st codon. Of the five N-RAS mutant-positive patients investigated by the PCR analysis, one had a mutation at codon 12, two had mutations at codon 13, and two had mutations at codon 61. None of the patients had mutations of the K-RAS oncogene. These results suggest that the frequency of RAS gene mutation in multiple myeloma is higher than in other lymphoid malignancies such as acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and malignant lymphoma. As the mutation was observed only at the N-RAS oncogene level, it is speculated that N-RAS oncogene activation might play an important role in the progression of multiple myeloma.","['Tanaka, K', 'Takechi, M', 'Asaoku, H', 'Dohy, H', 'Kamada, N']","['Tanaka K', 'Takechi M', 'Asaoku H', 'Dohy H', 'Kamada N']","['Department of Hematology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Oct;56(2):119-27.,,,,"['K-RAS', 'N-RAS']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For unexplained reasons, K-ras mutations are predominantly found in pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and adeno-carcinoma of the lung, N-ras is predominantly found in a subset of acute leukemias and in myelodysplastic syndromes, while H-ras mutations are rare. In most tumors, ras mutations are not clearly associated with specific clinical or biological features, but in lung cancer, childhood lymphoblastic leukemia and possibly in myelodysplastic syndromes ras mutations may predict a poor prognosis.

To determine whether OM, like CDF/LIF and CNTF, possesses trophic or differentiative functions for neurons we examined the effects of recombinant human OM on ciliary neuron survival and neurotransmitter expression in sympathetic neurons. Like CDF/LIF, but in contrast to CNTF, OM had no effect on ciliary neuronal survival at any concentration tested. OM produced small but reproducible increases in choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels in rat sympathetic neuron cultures, but this effect was significantly less than that of CNTF or CDF/LIF. To determine if human OM would elicit a more robust response from human cells, we utilized a human neuroblastoma cell line, NBFL, that responds to CNTF and CDF/LIF by altering vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels. OM specifically elevated VIP and c-fos mRNA levels in NBFL cells and was as potent as CDF/LIF in this assay. Our data provides evidence that OM acts on neurons and identifies a neural cell line responsive to OM, CNTF, CDF/LIF.","['Rao, M S', 'Symes, A', 'Malik, N', 'Shoyab, M', 'Fink, J S', 'Landis, S C']","['Rao MS', 'Symes A', 'Malik N', 'Shoyab M', 'Fink JS', 'Landis SC']","['Division of Biology, Caltech, Pasadena.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Neuroreport,Neuroreport,9100935,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chick Embryo', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Indicators and Reagents', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/*metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*biosynthesis']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuroreport. 1992 Oct;3(10):865-8. doi: 10.1097/00001756-199210000-00011.,,['10.1097/00001756-199210000-00011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
