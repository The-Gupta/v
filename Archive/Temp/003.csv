Monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ), a member of the MYST (MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, Tip60) family, is a histone acetyltransferase. MOZ is involved in various cellular functions: generation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, development of erythroid cells, B-lineage progenitors and myeloid cells, and regulation of cellular senescence. Studies have shown that MOZ is susceptible to translocation in chromosomal rearrangements to form fusion genes, leading to the fusion of MOZ with other cellular regulators to form MOZ fusion proteins. Different MOZ fusion proteins have different roles, such as in the development and progression of hematological malignancies and inhibition of cellular senescence. Thus, MOZ is an attractive target, and targeting MOZ to design small-molecule drugs can help to treat hematological malignancies. This review summarizes recent progress in biology and medicinal chemistry for the histone acetyltransferase MOZ. In the biology section, MOZ and cofactors, structures of MOZ and related HATs, MOZ and fusion proteins, and roles of MOZ in cancer are discussed. In medicinal chemistry, recent developments in MOZ inhibitors are summarized.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

By combining and analyzing genetic and phenotypic data with bioinformatics analysis, we greatly expanded this pathway and identified many key regulators, including low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). We demonstrated that LRP1 mediates the ubiquitination chain linkage switching of Delta ligands, which further affects ligand recycling, membrane localization, and stability. LRP1 inhibition led to Notch signaling inhibition and decreased tumorigenesis in leukemia models.

Recently, several studies indicated the anti-tumor potential of antipsychotic medicine. Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder since 1997. However, whether quetiapine may show potential to suppress HCC progression and its underlying mechanism is persisting unclear. Quetiapine has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit invasion ability in HCC in vitro. Here, we established two different HCC (Hep3B, SK-Hep1) bearing animals to identify the treatment efficacy of quetiapine. Tumor growth, signaling transduction, and normal tissue pathology after quetiapine treatment were validated by caliper, bioluminescence image, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and hematoxylin and eosin staining, respectively. Quetiapine suppressed HCC progression in a dose-dependent manner. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) mediated downstream proteins, such as myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL-1), cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (C-FLIP), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), Cyclin-D1, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which involved in proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and anti-tumor immunity were all decreased by quetiapine. In addition, extrinsic/intrinsic caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways, including cleaved caspase-3, -8, and - 9 were increased by quetiapine. In sum, the tumor inhibition that results from quetiapine may associate with ERK and NF-kappaB inactivation.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Isolated skin involvement is termed cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and the term systemic mastocytosis (SM) refers to multi-organ involvement, most commonly of the bone marrow, skin, liver, and spleen. A subset of patients with SM have an associated clonal hematologic neoplasm which is most commonly myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or acute myelogenous leukemia and this entity is termed SM with associated hematological neoplasm (AHN). Bone marrow involvement is present in all patients regardless of the subtype of SM. The genetic hallmark of SM is a somatic gain-of-function point mutation within the KIT gene. Other molecular aberrations that have been reported include somatic mutations in TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, CBL, RUNX1, and RAS and these are common in SM-AHN. The clinical presentation of SM can range from indolent to advanced depending on extent of mast cell burden and genetic profile. In the case of indolent SM, the goal of treatment is to control mediator release-related effects as well as to reduce mast cell burden.

The treatment of patients with CML has changed dramatically since the approval of imatinib and other TKIs. Before the TKI era, newly diagnosed patients would undergo HLA typing to try to identify a well-matched donor, and then proceed quickly to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With the introduction of imatinib followed a few years later by dasatinib, nilotinib, then bosutinib, treatment approaches changed in a dramatic way. Transplantation is no longer an upfront treatment option for newly diagnosed CML patients, and in fact, it is very rarely used in the management of a patient with CML currently. The management of CML patients has been a model of personalized medicine or targeted therapy that is being emulated in the treatment of many other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors such as lung cancer [Soverini et al. in Mol Cancer 17:49, 2018]. The Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) which leads to the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene and its product the BCR-ABL protein is the cause of CML. With effective targeting of this protein with the available TKIs, the disease is completely controllable if not curable for most patients. Life expectancy for patients with CML is essentially normal. Quality of life becomes an important goal including the potential for pregnancy, and ultimately the chance to discontinue all TKI therapy permanently. The three cases outlined below serve to highlight some of the important issues in the management of patients with CML in the post-TKI era.",['(c) 2021.

Nonetheless, there is limited information on the effect of pooling on test performance, and research is required to determine the appropriate number of samples which can be pooled. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the use of pooled serum samples as a herd-level surveillance tool for infectious production-limiting diseases: bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) and Neospora caninum (NC), by investigating the maximum number of samples one can pool to identify one positive animal, using commercial antibody-detection ELISAs. Four positive field standards (PFS), one for each disease, were prepared by pooling highly positive herd-level samples diagnosed using commercially available ELISA tests. These PFS were used to simulate 18 pooled samples ranging from undiluted PFS to a dilution representing 1 positive in 1,000 animals using phosphate-buffered saline as diluent. A 1:10 dilution of the PFS resulted in positive results for IBR, BVD and EBL. Moreover, for IBR and BVD, results were still positive at 1:100 and 1:30 dilutions, respectively. However, for NC, a lower dilution (8:10) was required for a seropositive result. This study indicates that, at herd-level, the use of pooled serum is a useful strategy for monitoring infectious diseases (BVD, IBR and EBL) but not NC, using readily available diagnostic assays.",['(c) 2021.

Patients with this cancer predisposition syndrome may have multiple organ dysfunctions including pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and bone marrow failure. Not all mutations in telomerase or telomere genes have been identified, and STS may pose a diagnostic and management challenge. METHODS: A retrospective chart review and literature search were done for this report. RESULTS: Here, we report a case of atypical DC with a heterozygous germline missense mutation in the postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2) gene, exon 5, (c.466A>G (p. Thr156Ala)). The PMS2 (a mismatch repair protein) gene is known to be an important mediator of telomere-induced aging. The patient was transfusion dependent and underwent successful umbilical cord blood transplant using a non-myeloablative regimen with alemtuzumab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation.

It typically occurs in elderly patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that interfere with the regulation of proliferation and of apoptosis in clonal B-cells. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen as well as typical B-cell markers. PROGNOSIS AND STAGING: The clinical staging systems provide prognostic information by using the results of physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers provide additional prognostic information. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del[17p]) and/or mutations of the TP53 gene predict resistance to chemoimmunotherapy and a shorter time to progression with most targeted therapies. The CLL international prognostic index integrates genetic, biological, and clinical variables to identify distinct risk groups of patients with CLL. THERAPY: Only patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. When treatment is indicated, several therapeutic options exist: a combination of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax with obinutuzumab, monotherapy with inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, or chemoimmunotherapy. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated, if the treatment-free interval exceeds 3 years. If the disease relapses earlier, therapy should be changed using an alternative regimen. Patients with a del(17p) or TP53 mutation are usually resistant to chemotherapy and should, therefore, be treated with targeted agents. FUTURE CHALLENGES: Combinations of targeted agents are now being investigated to create efficient, potentially curative therapies of CLL with fixed duration. One of the most relevant questions currently addressed in clinical trials is the comparison of monotherapies with BTK inhibitors with fixed duration combination therapies. Moreover, the optimal sequencing of targeted therapies remains to be determined. Alternative therapies are needed for patients with BTK and BCL2 inhibitor double-refractory disease.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: The clinical data of 44 newly diagnosed AL patients with TP53 variant detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) were analyzed retrospectively. Targeted sequencing technique containing 108 leukemia-related genes was used for variant analysis, and conventional R-banding technique was used for karyotype analysis. The clinical features, cytogenetics, gene variant, curative effect and survival of AL patients with TP53 gene variant were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of AML patients with TP53 gene variant (46 years) was higher than that of ALL patients (17.5 years), and the median number of bone marrow blasts (40.5%) was lower than the latter (89.2%), the differences were statistically significant (P< 0.01). A total of 28 cases of abnormal karyotype were detected, of which 25 cases were complex karyotype, 16 cases were monomeric karyotype, 14 cases had -17/17p-. The detection rates of TP53 in complex karyotype, monomeric karyotype and -17/17p- were 59.5%, 38.1% and 33.3%, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that the detection rate of TP53 gene abnormalities in AML and ALL complex karyotypes was 73.1% and 40% respectively, the difference was statistically significant. A total of 41 TP53 gene variant types were found, and the median variant frequency was 43.58%. 75.6% variant was located in the DNA binding domain. The concomitant variant genes were mainly TET2 and IKZF1. Among 18 AML and 17 ALL patients who could be evaluated the curative effect, the CR rate of one course of treatment was 22.2% and 94.12% respectively, and the difference was statistically significant. The median RFS of 4 cases of AML with CR and 16 cases of ALL with CR were 174 and 246 days respectively, the difference was statistically insignificant. The median OS of AML and ALL was 20 and 375 days respectively, the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The TP53 gene variant is associated with the complex karyotype of AML, but has no significant effect on ALL. The variant site of TP53 gene was mainly distributed in the DNA binding domain. The remission rate of AML with TP53 gene variant was lower than that of ALL. The prognosis of AL patients with TP53 gene variant is poor, so allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be performed as soon as possible to prolong the survival of the patients.",,"['Mi, Ruihua', 'Guo, Zhen', 'Liu, Wen', 'Hu, Jieying', 'Fan, Ruihua', 'Chen, Lin', 'Liu, Jia', 'Wei, Xudong']","['Mi R', 'Guo Z', 'Liu W', 'Hu J', 'Fan R', 'Chen L', 'Liu J', 'Wei X']","['Department of Hematopathy, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450008, China. weixudong63 @126.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,IM,,,2021/10/10 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/10/09 06:29'],"['2021/10/09 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['940638200 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20200414-00262 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Oct 10;38(10):955-960. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20200414-00262.,20211012,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']","['Acute Disease', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSCT is required for restoration of hematopoiesis in patients with inherited BM failure syndromes (iBMFSs). Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare iBMFS associated with mutations in SBDS. Previous studies have demonstrated that SBDS deficiency in osteolineage niche cells causes BM dysfunction that promotes leukemia development. However, it is unknown whether BM niche defects caused by SBDS deficiency also impair efficient engraftment of healthy donor HSC after HSCT, a hypothesis that could explain morbidity noted after clinical HSCT for patients with SDS. Here, we report a mouse model with inducible Sbds deletion in hematopoietic and osteolineage cells. Primary and secondary BM transplantation (BMT) studies demonstrated that SBDS deficiency within BM niches caused poor donor hematopoietic recovery and specifically poor HSC engraftment after myeloablative BMT. We have also identified multiple molecular and cellular defects within niche populations that are driven by SBDS deficiency and are accentuated by or develop specifically after myeloablative conditioning. These abnormalities include altered frequencies of multiple niche cell subsets, including mesenchymal lineage cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells; disruption of growth factor signaling, chemokine pathway activation, and adhesion molecule expression; and p53 pathway activation and signals involved in cell cycle arrest. Taken together, this study demonstrates that SBDS deficiency profoundly impacts recipient hematopoietic niche function in the setting of HSCT, suggesting that novel therapeutic strategies targeting host niches could improve clinical HSCT outcomes for patients with SDS.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, such resistance-conferring mutations are rare and do not explain most disease recurrence seen in the clinic. We have generated stable ATO-resistant promyelocytic cell lines that are also less sensitive to ATRA and the combination of ATO and ATRA compared to the sensitive cell line. Characterization of these in-house generated resistant cell lines showed significant differences in immunophenotype, drug transporter expression, anti-apoptotic protein dependence, and PML-RARA mutation. Gene expression profiling revealed prominent dysregulation of the cellular metabolic pathways in these ATO resistant APL cell lines. Glycolytic inhibition by 2-DG was sufficient and comparable to the standard of care (ATO) in targeting the sensitive APL cell line. 2-DG was also effective in the in vivo transplantable APL mouse model; however, it did not affect the ATO resistant cell lines. In contrast, the resistant cell lines were significantly affected by compounds targeting the mitochondrial respiration when combined with ATO, irrespective of the ATO resistance-conferring genetic mutations or the pattern of their anti-apoptotic protein dependency.

We investigated the association between risk of asparaginase-associated toxicities (AspTox) and asparaginase enzyme activity (AEA) levels in 1155 children aged 1.0 to 17.9 years, diagnosed with ALL between July 2008 and March 2016, and treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol. Patients with >/=2 blood samples for AEA measurement drawn 14 +/- 2 days after asparaginase administration were included (6944 trough values). AEA was measurable (or >0 IU/L) in 955 patients, whereas 200 patients (17.3%) had asparaginase inactivation and few AspTox recorded. A time-dependent multiple Cox model of time to any first asparaginase-associated toxicity adjusted for sex and age was used. For patients with measurable AEA, we found a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.17 per 100 IU/L increase in median AEA (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.41; P = .09). For pancreatitis, thromboembolism, and osteonecrosis, the HRs were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12-1.75; P = .002), 0.99 (95% CI, 0.70-1.40; P = .96), and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.04-1.77; P = .02) per 100 IU/L increase in median AEA, respectively. No significant decrease in the risk of leukemic relapse was found: HR 0.88 per 100 IU/L increase in AEA (95% CI, 0.66-1.16; P = .35). In conclusion, these results emphasize that overall AspTox and relapse are not associated with AEA levels, yet the risk of pancreatitis and osteonecrosis increases with increasing AEA levels.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

We evaluated the use of postinduction WT1 MRD level as a prognostic factor, as well as the interaction between postinduction WT1 MRD response and the effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in the first complete remission (CR). In the ALFA-0702 trial, patients with AML, aged 18 to 59, had a prospective quantification of WT1 MRD. The occurrence of a WT1 MRD ratio >2.5% in bone marrow or >0.5% in peripheral blood was defined as MRDhigh, and ratios below these thresholds were defined as MRDlow. The prognostic value of MRD after induction chemotherapy was assessed in 314 patients in first CR by comparing the risk of relapse, the relapse-free survival (RFS), and the overall survival (OS). Interaction between MRD response and the allo-SCT effect was evaluated in patients by comparing the influence of allo-SCT on the outcomes of patients with MRDhigh with those with MRDlow. The results showed that patients with MRDhigh after induction had a higher risk of relapse and a shorter RFS and OS. The MRD response remained of strong prognostic value in the subset of 225 patients with intermediate-/unfavorable-risk AML who were eligible for allo-SCT, because patients with MRDhigh had a significantly higher risk of relapse resulting in worse RFS and OS. The effect of allo-SCT was higher in patients with MRDlow than in those with MRDhigh, but not significantly different. The early WT1 MRD response highlights a population of high-risk patients in need of additional therapy.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Still, the clinical course of CLL patients is highly variable and most previously recognized prognostic features lack the capacity to predict response to modern treatments indicating the need for new prognostic markers. In this study, we identified four epigenetically distinct proteomic signatures of a large cohort of CLL and related diseases derived samples (n = 871) using reverse phase protein array technology. These signatures are associated with clinical features including age, cytogenetic abnormalities [trisomy 12, del(13q) and del(17p)], immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (IGHV) mutational load, ZAP-70 status, Binet and Rai staging as well as with the outcome measures of time to treatment and overall survival. Protein signature membership was identified as predictive marker for overall survival regardless of other clinical features. Among the analyzed epigenetic proteins, EZH2, HDAC6, and loss of H3K27me3 levels were the most independently associated with poor survival. These findings demonstrate that proteomic based epigenetic biomarkers can be used to better classify CLL patients and provide therapeutic guidance.","['(c) 2021.

In this study, we investigated the expression, biological function, molecular mechanism, and clinical implication of PCID2 in CRC. PCID2 mRNA and protein expression were higher in CRC cells and tumor tissues compared to healthy colonic tissues. The copy number of PCID2 was positively correlated with its mRNA expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that PCID2 is an independent prognostic factor for CRC recurrence. Functional studies showed that PCID2 promoted cell growth, cell cycle progression, and cell migration/invasion, while apoptosis was suppressed. Moreover, PCID2 promoted xenograft growth and lung metastasis in nude mice. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy, we showed that PCID2 binds to promyelocytic leukemia (PML), a tumor suppressor involved in non-canonical beta-catenin signaling. PCID2 promoted the degradation of PML via poly-ubiquitination, which in turn, induced Wnt/beta-catenin signaling while simultaneously repressing ARF-p53 pathway. Thus, these results demonstrated that PCID2 functions as an oncogene in CRC by enhancing canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and inhibition of CTNNB1-ARF-p53 axis.

In a subset of patients, durable remissions can be achieved with a second allo-HSCT (allo-HSCT2). However, many patients experience relapse after allo-HSCT2 and they may be considered for a third allo-HSCT (allo-HSCT3). Nevertheless, the benefit of allo-HSCT3 remains unconfirmed. Thus, herein a retrospective analysis of 253 allo-HSCT3s in patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia was carried out. In total, 29 (11.5%) survived at a median follow-up of 794 days (range: 87-4 619). The 3-year leukemia-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were 9.7% and 10.9%, respectively. Patients who maintained remission for >/=2 years after allo-HSCT2 had a significantly better 3-year OS (35.8%) than those who experienced early relapse (<1 year, 7.8%; 1-2 years, 14.0%; P = 0.004). Complete remission at allo-HSCT3, performance status score of 0-1 at allo-HSCT3, grade I acute graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT2, and relapse >/=2 years after allo-HSCT2 were associated with better survival in patients who received allo-HSCT3. The prognosis after allo-HSCT3 in patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia is generally unfavorable. However, given the lack of alternative treatment options, allo-HSCT3 may be considered in a group of patients.","['(c) 2021.

It can present before, concurrent with, or after the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia or other myeloproliferative diseases, and a proportion of patients never develop bone marrow infiltration. Only a few isolated cases of pediatric orbital myeloid sarcoma have been reported, and they are often associated with a high misdiagnosis rate. CASE REPORT: We report a rare case of pediatric orbital myeloid sarcoma associated with blunt trauma in a 3-year-old Caucasian male patient, which was clinically and radiologically misdiagnosed for orbital subperiostal hematoma. The patient underwent a surgical intervention to drain the hematoma when an orbital mass was found. The microscopic, immunologic, and genetic features of the tumor and the myelogram were in favor of LAM2, and the patient was started with chemotherapy with a favorable evolution within 18 months follow-up. CONCLUSION: Orbital myeloid sarcoma usually exhibits clinical and radiological features that can be easily misleading, especially if it happens de novo or as the first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. Only a few isolated cases have reported and proposed trauma as a trigger event of the onset of this type of tumor proliferation, but further investigations and evidence are needed to support this hypothesis.",['(c) 2021.

The Philadelphia chromosome is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia. However, it may also be associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia. The common BCR-ABL1 transcripts seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia are e1a2, e13a2, and e14a2, while other transcripts such as e1a3, e13a3, and e6a2 occur rarely. This report describes the presentation, management, and outcome of the occurrence of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the rare e1a3 BCR-ABL1 transcript in a patient with sickle cell anemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old male Nigerian, a known sickle cell anemia patient was admitted on account of severe vaso-occlusive crisis. Examination revealed fever, palor, and jaundice. Full blood count showed anemia and leukocytosis. Peripheral blood and bone marrow smears revealed numerous large and small lymphoblasts in keeping with the L2 subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on the French-American-British classification. Further evaluation was in keeping with a diagnosis of BCR-ABL1-positive mature B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with the rare e1a3 transcript. He was commenced simultaneously on induction chemotherapy and Imatinib while being prepared for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

In contrast, decreased cytotoxic effects against non-neoplastic blood cells, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts were observed. However, the actual FX-9 molecular mode of action is currently not fully understood. METHODS: In this study, microarray gene expression analysis comparing FX-9 exposed and unexposed prostate cancer cells (PC-3 representing castration-resistant prostate cancer), followed by pathway analysis and gene annotation to functional processes were performed. Immunocytochemistry staining was performed with selected targets. RESULTS: Expression analysis revealed 0.83% of 21,448 differential expressed genes (DEGs) after 6-h exposure of FX-9 and 0.68% DEGs after 12-h exposure thereof. Functional annotation showed that FX-9 primarily caused an activation of inflammatory response by non-canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling. The 6-h samples showed activation of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A which might be involved in the secondary response in 12-h samples. This secondary response predominantly consisted of cell cycle-related changes, with further activation of CDKN1A and inhibition of the transcription factor E2F1, including downstream target genes, resulting in G1-phase arrest. Matching our previous observations on cellular level senescence signaling pathways were also found enriched. To verify these results immunocytochemical staining of p21 Waf1/Cip1 (CDKN1A), E2F1 (E2F1), PAI-1 (SERPNE1), and NFkB2/NFkB p 100 (NFKB2) was performed. Increased expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and NFkB2/NFkB p 100 after 24-h exposure to FX-9 was shown. E2F1 and PAI-1 showed no increased expression. CONCLUSIONS: FX-9 induced G1-phase arrest of PC-3 cells through activation of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A, which was initiated by an inflammatory response of noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling.",['(c) 2021.

Recently, the co-infection of CIAV and ALV-J frequently occurred in the domestic chicken flocks in China. However, the synergistic pathogenesis of CIAV and ALV-J has not been fully investigated. Here, a co-infection study was performed to further understand the potential synergistic pathogenesis of CIAV and ALV-J. In vitro study showed that CIAV could promote the replication of ALV-J in HD11 cells, but ALV-J could not increase the replication of CIAV. Chicken infection study showed both CIAV and ALV-J with synergistic effects caused significant body weight loss to the infected chickens. Although ALV-J had no effect on CIAV viral shedding and tissue load, CIAV did significantly increase ALV-J viremia, viral shedding and tissue load in the co-infection group. Moreover, both CIAV and ALV-J could significantly inhibit the humoral immunity to H9N2 influenza virus and serotype 4 fowl adenovirus (FAdV-4). All these data demonstrate the synergistic pathogenesis for the co-infection of CIAV and ALV-J, and highlight the positive effect of CIAV on the pathogenesis of ALV-J.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Overall survival for patients aged 75 years and older with haematological malignancies is generally poor, particularly for acute leukaemias. Understanding the heterogeneity in outcomes for haematological malignancies, treatment challenges, and management of frailty and comorbidities among older patients could help physicians to better address the haematological cancer burden and mortality in ageing populations. The aim of this Series paper is to provide an updated overview of the knowledge accumulated over the past decade regarding treatment options and broader management considerations in older adults with haematological malignancies, focusing on the most common entities encountered across lymphoma, acute leukaemia, chronic leukaemia, and multiple myeloma disease categories. Future strategies, such as increasing enrolment rates of older adults in clinical trials and incorporating patient-reported outcome measurements in daily clinical practice, will assist in providing more individualised health care.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The pathogenesis is largely unknown, and the treatment is challenging. We previously reported the specific association of the recurrent t(8;12)(q13;p13) chromosomal translocation, creating ETV6-NCOA2 fusion, with T/myeloid leukemias. Here we report that ETV6-NCOA2 initiates T/myeloid leukemia in preclinical models; ectopic expression of ETV6-NCOA2 in mouse bone-marrow hematopoietic progenitors induced T/myeloid lymphoma accompanied by spontaneous Notch1 activating mutations. Similarly, co-transduction of human cord-blood CD34+ progenitors with ETV6-NCOA2 and a non-transforming NOTCH1 mutant induced T/myeloid leukemia in immunodeficient mice; the immunophenotype and gene expression pattern was similar to that of patient-derived ETV6-NCOA2 leukemias. Mechanistically, we show that ETV6-NCOA2 forms a transcriptional complex with ETV6 and the histone acetyltransferase p300, leading to de-repression of ETV6 target genes. The expression of ETV6-NCOA2 in human and mouse non-thymic hematopoietic progenitor cells induces transcriptional dysregulation, which activates a lymphoid program while failing to repress the expression of myeloid genes such as CSF1 and MEF2C. The ETV6-NCOA2 induced arrest at early-immature T-cell developmental stage. The additional acquisition of activating NOTCH1 mutations transforms the early-immature ETV6-NCOA2 cells into T/myeloid leukemias. Here, we describe the first preclinical model to depict the initiation of T/myeloid leukemia by a specific somatic genetic aberration.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Fishman, Hila', 'Madiwale, Shreyas', 'Geron, Ifat', 'Bari, Vase', 'Van Loocke, Wouter', 'Kirschenbaum, Yael', 'Ganmore, Itamar', 'Kugler, Eitan', 'Rein-Gil, Avigail', 'Friedlander, Gilgi', 'Schiby, Ginette', 'Birger, Yehudit', 'Strehl, Sabine', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Knoechel, Birgit', 'Ferrando, Adolfo', 'Noy Lotan, Sharon', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Fishman H', 'Madiwale S', 'Geron I', 'Bari V', 'Van Loocke W', 'Kirschenbaum Y', 'Ganmore I', 'Kugler E', 'Rein-Gil A', 'Friedlander G', 'Schiby G', 'Birger Y', 'Strehl S', 'Soulier J', 'Knoechel B', 'Ferrando A', 'Noy Lotan S', 'Nagler A', 'Mulloy JC', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Izraeli S']","['Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's hospital, United States."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University.', 'Cancer Research Center, Chaim Sheba Medical Centre, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, Chaim Sheba Medical Centre, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, Chaim Sheba Medical Centre, Israel.', 'WEizmann Institute of Science.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Yehud, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Hospital Saint-Louis and University of Paris, Saint-Louis, France.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States.', ""Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tiqva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States."", 'Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '1Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211008,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/10/09 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2021/10/08 17:17'],"['2021/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/08 17:17 [entrez]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01711-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020010405 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Oct 8. pii: S0006-4971(21)01711-0. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020010405.,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4392-3430', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7385-0546', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9399-2656', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0179-0628', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8040-0535', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6938-2540']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the increasing incidence and prevalence of this condition, it is highly relevant to better characterise these patients in Portugal, where data is still scarce. METHODS: To determine incidence, clinical presentation, survival and second malignancies, a population-based historical cohort study was conducted. Cases of interest were identified through the South Region Cancer Registry database and additional data sources. Patients aged >/=18 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma between January 1st, 2013 and December 31st, 2014 were included. Patients were followed-up until death or cut-off date (December 31st, 2019). RESULTS: A total of 496 patients were included and median follow-up time was 5.46 years. Crude incidence rates were 5.03 and 5.22 per 100,000 inhabitants for 2013 and 2014, respectively, and age-adjusted incidence rates were 3.18:100,000 European population for 2013 and 3.35:100,000 European population for 2014. Median age at diagnosis was 71 years and the male/female ratio was 1.40. The majority of patients had leukemic presentation of the disease (86.09%), was diagnosed in Binet stage A (75.58%) and did not present B symptoms (84.01%), anaemia (haemoglobin </=10g/dL; 90.63%) nor thrombocytopenia (platelet count </=100 000/muL; 91.73%). Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 70.53% (95%CI 66.31-74.34) and age, lactate dehydrogenase, Binet stage and a >/=5 Charlson comorbidity index score were independently associated with OS. Standardised-incidence ratios for any second malignancy and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma were 1.59 (95%CI 1.19-2.08) and 10.15 (95%CI 6.28-15.51), respectively. CONCLUSION: Incidence, clinical presentation and survival of CLL Portuguese patients are similar to those reported for other western countries.

As such, it is a promising target in cancer therapy, although only a limited number of Taspase1 inhibitors lacking general applicability are currently available. Here we present a bivalent guanidiniocarbonyl-pyrrole (GCP)-containing supramolecular ligand that is capable of disrupting the essential interaction between Taspase1 and its cognate import receptor Importin alpha in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro with an IC50 of 35 muM. Here, size of the bivalent vs the monovalent construct as well as its derivation with an aromatic cbz-group arose as critical determinants for efficient interference of 2GC. This was also evident when we investigated the effects in different tumor cell lines, resulting in comparable EC50 values ( approximately 40-70 muM). Of note, in higher concentrations, 2GC also interfered with Taspase1's proteolytic activity.

Currently, cause-specific survival (CSS) analyses exclude these cancers because the cause of death (COD) classification algorithm was available only for first cancers. The authors added rules for later cancers to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cause-specific death classification algorithm and evaluated CSS to include individuals with prior tumors. METHODS: The authors constructed 2 cohorts: 1) the first ever primary cohort, including patients whose first cancer was diagnosed during 2000 through 2016) and 2) the earliest matching primary cohort, including patients with any cancer who matched the selection criteria irrespective of whether it was the first or a later cancer diagnosed during 2000 through 2016. The cohorts' CSS estimates were compared using follow-up through December 31, 2017. The new rules were used in the second cohort for patients whose first cancers during 2000 through 2016 were their second or later cancers. RESULTS: Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in CSS estimates between the 2 cohorts. Estimates were similar by age, stage, race, and time since diagnosis, except for patients with leukemia and those aged 65 to 74 years (3.4 percentage point absolute difference). CONCLUSIONS: The absolute difference in CSS estimates for the first cancer ever cohort versus earliest of any cancers cohort in the study period was small for most cancer types. As the number of newly diagnosed patients with prior cancers increases, the algorithm will make CSS more inclusive and enable estimating survival for a group of patients with cancer for whom life tables are not available or life tables are available but do not capture other-cause mortality appropriately.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['Forjaz, Goncalo', 'Howlader, Nadia', 'Scoppa, Steve', 'Johnson, Christopher J', 'Mariotto, Angela B']","['Forjaz G', 'Howlader N', 'Scoppa S', 'Johnson CJ', 'Mariotto AB']","['Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Azores Cancer Registry, Azores Oncological Center, Angra do Heroismo, Portugal.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Information Management Services, Inc, Calverton, Maryland.', 'Cancer Data Registry of Idaho, Boise, Idaho.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211008,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program', '*algorithms', '*cause of death', '*frailty', '*life tables', '*multiple primary', '*neoplasms', '*survival analysis']",2021/10/09 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2021/10/08 12:29'],"['2021/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/08 12:29 [entrez]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.33940 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Cancer. 2021 Oct 8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33940.,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8855-2042'],"['CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education', 'US Department of Energy', 'NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

There are few studies in the literature about outcome, survival, and difficulties of treating patients with DS and acute leukemia in a developing country. This study aimed to analyze the outcome, response to treatment, survival, treatment complications, and causes of death in patients with DS and acute leukemia compared with those in patients with acute leukemia without DS diagnosed in the same period of time.We conducted a retrospective observational analysis including a cohort of 21 patients with DS and acute leukemia diagnosed between 2009 and 2018 in 3 hemato-oncology centers (2 pediatric centers and 1 adult hematology center). A group of patients with DS-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (DS-ALL) was analyzed and compared with a group of 165 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia without DS, and a group of patients with DS-acute myeloid leukemia (DS-AML) was analyzed and compared with a group of 50 patients with acute myeloid leukemia without DS, which was diagnosed during the same period of time (2009-2018) and treated under similar conditions in terms of both treatment protocols and economic resources.The overall survival rates in children with DS-ALL and DS-AML were 35.7% and 57.1%, respectively (P = .438). The overall survival rate was significantly worse in children with DS-ALL than in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia without DS (35.71% vs 75.80%, P = .001). We noted that treatment-related mortality in the patients with DS-ALL was high (50%) (infections and toxicities related to chemotherapy); this result was significantly different from that for patients with leukemia without DS (P < .0001). The relapse rate was higher in patients with DS-ALL but not significantly higher than that in patients without DS (P = .13).In contrast, the overall survival rate was better for patients with DS-AML than for those with acute myeloid leukemia without DS (57.1% vs 45.1%, P = .47).Because of the particularities of the host, we suggest that DS-ALL and DS-AML should be considered as independent diseases and treated according to specific protocols with therapy optimization per the minimal residual disease.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

The estimated incidence is approximately 3%. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old man was unable to stand up because of spastic paraparesis 1 month after the onset. He developed lymphadenopathy in the left supraclavicular fossa 5 months after the onset. The spastic paraplegia and sensory symptoms below the thoracic spinal cord level worsened. DIAGNOSES: Both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests were positive for anti-HTLV-1 antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with rapidly progressive HAM/TSP. He was also diagnosed with lymphoma-type ATL by the biopsy specimen of the lymph node. CSF examination at the time of symptom exacerbation showed abnormal lymphocytes, suggesting central infiltration of the ATL in the central nervous system. INTERVENTIONS: Methylprednisolone pulse therapy and oral prednisolone maintenance therapy were administered for rapidly progressive HAM/TSP. Intrathecal injection of methotrexate was administered for the suggested central infiltration of the ATL. OUTCOMES: Methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intrathecal injection of methotrexate did not improve the patient's exacerbated symptoms. Five months later, clumsiness and mild muscle weakness of the fingers appeared, and magnetic resonance imaging showed swelling of the cervical spinal cord. Clonality analysis showed monoclonal proliferation only in the DNA of a lymph node lesion, but not in the CSF and peripheral blood cells. LESSONS: This was a case of rapidly progressive HAM/TSP associated with lymphoma-type ATL that was refractory to steroids and chemotherapy. The pathogenesis was presumed to involve ATL cells in the brain and spinal cord because of the presence of abnormal lymphocytes in the CSF, but DNA analysis could not prove direct invasion. This case suggests that when we encounter cases with refractory HAM/TSP, it should be needed to suspect the presence of ATL in the background.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Epigenetic regulators are recurrently mutated in MDS, directly implicating epigenetic dysregulation in MDS pathogenesis. Here, we identified a tumor suppressor role of the acetyltransferase p300 in clinically relevant MDS models driven by mutations in the epigenetic regulators TET2, ASXL1, and SRSF2. The loss of p300 enhanced the proliferation and self-renewal capacity of Tet2-deficient HSPCs, resulting in an increased HSPC pool and leukemogenicity in primary and transplantation mouse models. Mechanistically, the loss of p300 in Tet2-deficient HSPCs altered enhancer accessibility and the expression of genes associated with differentiation, proliferation, and leukemia development. Particularly, p300 loss led to an increased expression of Myb, and the depletion of Myb attenuated the proliferation of HSPCs and improved the survival of leukemia-bearing mice. Additionally, we show that chemical inhibition of p300 acetyltransferase activity phenocopied Ep300 deletion in Tet2-deficient HSPCs, whereas activation of p300 activity with a small molecule impaired the self-renewal and leukemogenicity of Tet2-deficient cells. This suggests a potential therapeutic application of p300 activators in the treatment of MDS with TET2 inactivating mutations.",,"['Man, Na', 'Mas, Gloria', 'Karl, Daniel L', 'Sun, Jun', 'Liu, Fan', 'Yang, Qin', 'Torres-Martin, Miguel', 'Itonaga, Hidehiro', 'Martinez, Concepcion', 'Chen, Shi', 'Xu, Ye', 'Duffort, Stephanie', 'Hamard, Pierre-Jacques', 'Chen, Chuan', 'Zucconi, Beth E', 'Cimmino, Luisa', 'Yang, Feng-Chun', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Cole, Philip A', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Man N', 'Mas G', 'Karl DL', 'Sun J', 'Liu F', 'Yang Q', 'Torres-Martin M', 'Itonaga H', 'Martinez C', 'Chen S', 'Xu Y', 'Duffort S', 'Hamard PJ', 'Chen C', 'Zucconi BE', 'Cimmino L', 'Yang FC', 'Xu M', 'Cole PA', 'Figueroa ME', 'Nimer SD']","['Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', ""Division of Genetics, Departments of Medicine and Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', ""Division of Genetics, Departments of Medicine and Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211008,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Epigenetics', 'Hematology', 'Leukemias']",2021/10/09 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2021/10/08 08:43'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/08 08:43 [entrez]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['138478 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.138478 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2021 Oct 8;6(19). pii: 138478. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.138478.,,,,19,,,"['R01 CA166835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM062437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 GM124357/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA240139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM062437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8525640,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to clarify recent causes of death in patients with Down syndrome in Japan. We calculated proportionate mortality and standardized mortality odds ratios (SMORs) among all deaths registered with Down syndrome as the cause of death (ICD-10 code, Q90) in the Japanese National Death Registry Database in 2014-2016. In the study period, 762 in patients with Down syndrome died. The main causes of death were pneumonia/respiratory infections (20.5%), congenital malformations of the circulatory system (11.2%), other diseases of the circulatory system (9.2%), and aspiration pneumonia (8.4%). The SMORs (95% confidence intervals) were higher for natural death, defined as death of an elderly person with no other cause of death to be mentioned (55.73 [36.92-84.12]), early-onset Alzheimer's disease, defined as Alzheimer's disease with onset <65 years of age (29.36 [16.44-52.44]), aspiration pneumonia (18.33 [14.03-23.96]), pneumonia/respiratory infections (8.11 [6.76-9.73]), congenital malformations of the circulatory system (8.07 [5.98-10.88]), and leukemia/lymphoma (2.16 [1.55-2.99]) but lower for malignant solid tumors (0.04 [0.02-0.06]) in patients with Down syndrome. Patients with Down syndrome had the greatest relative risk of dying from natural death, early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and respiratory illnesses, highlighting the need for appropriate medical, health, and welfare services.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Among these, the P3 protein of rabies virus localizes to the nucleus through the activity of several specific nuclear localization and nuclear export signals. The major defined functions of P3 are in evasion of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses, including through inhibition of DNA-binding by IFN-activated STAT1. P3 also localizes to nucleoli and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, and interacts with nucleolin and PML protein, indicative of several intranuclear roles. The relationship of P3 nuclear localization with pathogenicity, however, is unresolved. We report that nucleocytoplasmic localization of P3 proteins from a pathogenic RABV strain, Nishigahara (Ni) and a non-pathogenic Ni-derived strain, Ni-CE, differs significantly, with nuclear accumulation defective for Ni-CE-P3. Molecular mapping indicates that altered localization derives from a coordinated effect, including two residue substitutions that independently disable nuclear localization and augment nuclear export signals, collectively promoting nuclear exclusion. Intriguingly, this appears to relate to effects on protein conformation or regulatory mechanisms, rather than direct modification of defined trafficking signal sequences. These data provide new insights into the role of regulated nuclear trafficking of a viral protein in the pathogenicity of a virus that replicates in the cytoplasm.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S .

This may indicate that the presence of an F-MBL in the relative of a F-CLL patient is due to genetic susceptibility. In this study, we hypothesized that progressive changes in gene expression result in malignant transformation of B lymphocytes to F-MBL, and subsequent alterations in gene expression occur before overt F-CLL develops. The aim of this study of affected and unaffected individuals from a family with multiple CLL cases was to compare mRNA expression levels in control B-lymphocytes, pre-malignant F-MBL and malignant F-CLL cells. METHODS: To identify inherited changes in gene expression, a high-resolution DNA microarray was used to identify differentially abundant mRNAs in age-matched cases of F-MBL (n = 4), F-CLL (n = 2) and unaffected family relatives (F-Controls, n = 3) within one family. These were then compared to non-kindred controls (NK-Controls, n = 3) and sporadic CLL (S-CLL) cases (n = 6). RESULTS: Seven differentially abundant mRNAs were identified against similar genetic backgrounds of the family: GRASP and AC016745.3 were decreased in F-MBL and further decreased in F-CLL compared to F-Controls, whereas C11orf80 and METTL8 were progressively increased. PARP3 was increased in F-MBL compared to F-Controls but was decreased in F-CLL compared to F-MBL. Compared to F-Controls, levels of ROR1 and LEF1 were similarly increased in F-MBL and F-CLL. For six of the genes, there were no differences in mRNA levels between S-CLL and F-CLL; however PARP3 was higher in S-CLL.

Runs of homozygosity (ROH), defined based on long, continuous segments of homozygous SNPs, can be used to estimate both measured and unmeasured recessive genetic variation. We sought to examine genome-wide homozygosity and NHL risk. Methods: We used data from eight genome-wide association studies of four common NHL subtypes: 3061 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 3814 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 2784 follicular lymphoma (FL), and 808 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) cases, as well as 9374 controls. We examined the effect of homozygous variation on risk by: (1) estimating the fraction of the autosome containing runs of homozygosity (FROH); (2) calculating an inbreeding coefficient derived from the correlation among uniting gametes (F3); and (3) examining specific autosomal regions containing ROH. For each, we calculated beta coefficients and standard errors using logistic regression and combined estimates across studies using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: We discovered positive associations between FROH and CLL (beta = 21.1, SE = 4.41, P = 1.6 x 10(-6)) and FL (beta = 11.4, SE = 5.82, P = 0.02) but not DLBCL (P = 1.0) or MZL (P = 0.91). For F3, we observed an association with CLL (beta = 27.5, SE = 6.51, P = 2.4 x 10(-5)). We did not find evidence of associations with specific ROH, suggesting that the associations observed with FROH and F3 for CLL and FL risk were not driven by a single region of homozygosity. Conclusion: Our findings support the role of recessive genetic variation in the etiology of CLL and FL; additional research is needed to identify the specific loci associated with NHL risk.",,"['Moore, Amy', 'Machiela, Mitchell J', 'Machado, Moara', 'Wang, Sophia S', 'Kane, Eleanor', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Zhou, Weiyin', 'Carrington, Mary', 'Lan, Qing', 'Milne, Roger L', 'Birmann, Brenda M', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Albanes, Demetrius', 'Arslan, Alan A', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Bisanzi, Simonetta', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Bracci, Paige M', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Brooks-Wilson, Angela R', 'Canzian, Federico', 'Caporaso, Neil', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Conde, Lucia', 'Cox, David G', 'Cozen, Wendy', 'Curtin, Karen', 'De Vivo, Immaculata', 'de Sanjose, Silvia', 'Foretova, Lenka', 'Gapstur, Susan M', 'Ghesquieres, Herve', 'Giles, Graham G', 'Glenn, Martha', 'Glimelius, Bengt', 'Gao, Chi', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Jackson, Rebecca D', 'Liebow, Mark', 'Link, Brian K', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'McKay, James', 'Melbye, Mads', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Molina, Thierry J', 'Monnereau, Alain', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'North, Kari E', 'Offit, Kenneth', 'Patel, Alpa V', 'Piro, Sara', 'Ravichandran, Vignesh', 'Riboli, Elio', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Severson, Richard K', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Smedby, Karin E', 'Southey, Melissa C', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Staines, Anthony', 'Stewart, Carolyn', 'Teras, Lauren R', 'Tinker, Lesley F', 'Travis, Ruth C', 'Vajdic, Claire M', 'Vermeulen, Roel C H', 'Vijai, Joseph', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete', 'Weinstein, Stephanie', 'Doo, Nicole Wong', 'Zhang, Yawei', 'Zheng, Tongzhang', 'Chanock, Stephen J', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Dean, Michael', 'Camp, Nicola J', 'Yeager, Meredith', 'Berndt, Sonja I']","['Moore A', 'Machiela MJ', 'Machado M', 'Wang SS', 'Kane E', 'Slager SL', 'Zhou W', 'Carrington M', 'Lan Q', 'Milne RL', 'Birmann BM', 'Adami HO', 'Albanes D', 'Arslan AA', 'Becker N', 'Benavente Y', 'Bisanzi S', 'Boffetta P', 'Bracci PM', 'Brennan P', 'Brooks-Wilson AR', 'Canzian F', 'Caporaso N', 'Clavel J', 'Cocco P', 'Conde L', 'Cox DG', 'Cozen W', 'Curtin K', 'De Vivo I', 'de Sanjose S', 'Foretova L', 'Gapstur SM', 'Ghesquieres H', 'Giles GG', 'Glenn M', 'Glimelius B', 'Gao C', 'Habermann TM', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Jackson RD', 'Liebow M', 'Link BK', 'Maynadie M', 'McKay J', 'Melbye M', 'Miligi L', 'Molina TJ', 'Monnereau A', 'Nieters A', 'North KE', 'Offit K', 'Patel AV', 'Piro S', 'Ravichandran V', 'Riboli E', 'Salles G', 'Severson RK', 'Skibola CF', 'Smedby KE', 'Southey MC', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Staines A', 'Stewart C', 'Teras LR', 'Tinker LF', 'Travis RC', 'Vajdic CM', 'Vermeulen RCH', 'Vijai J', 'Weiderpass E', 'Weinstein S', 'Doo NW', 'Zhang Y', 'Zheng T', 'Chanock SJ', 'Rothman N', 'Cerhan JR', 'Dean M', 'Camp NJ', 'Yeager M', 'Berndt SI']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Departamento de Biologia Geral, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 31270-901, Brazil.', 'Division of Health Analytics, City of Hope Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, USA.', 'Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research in the Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Ragon Institute of MGH, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia.', ""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm 17176, Sweden.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

The relationship between HL and PTCL needs further exploration to understand the pathogenesis of metachronous lymphoma (ML) and find effective treatment options. We report a patient with ML, whose biopsy of a right cervical lymph node initially confirmed classical HL (CHL). CASE SUMMARY: We report a patient with ML, whose biopsy of a right cervical lymph node initially confirmed CHL, with typical reed-sternberg cells expressing CD30 and PAX-5. T-cell leukemia/lymphoma occurred 3 years after treatment, and a lymph node biopsy at the onset confirmed PTCL, nonspecific type, expressing CD3, CD4 and CD8. The patient was treated with standard doses of chemotherapy, programmed cell death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody, and chidamide, all of which failed to achieve complete remission.

Concomitant diseases are often present at the first manifestation. We describe the treatment of a patient with CD57-negative gammadeltaT-LGLL with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old woman with a 20-year history of anemia visited our hospital owing to severe dizziness and was admitted. Her condition was diagnosed as CD57-negative gammadeltaT-LGLL with PRCA through bone marrow cytology, bone marrow pathology, bone marrow flow cytometry, bone marrow multiplex polymerase chain reaction combined with fluorescent fragment analysis, and other tests. Treatment with prednisone, methotrexate, and subcutaneous erythropoietin did not significantly change her hemoglobin level. After treatment with oral cyclophosphamide for 3 mo, her hemoglobin level increased to approximately 100 g/L. After 5 mo of treatment, the patient could perform activities of daily living independently. CONCLUSION: The treatment of CD57-negative gammadeltaT-LGLL with PRCA with cyclophosphamide helps to improve prognosis.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Here we reported a case of sudden lymphoid blast crisis after 67 months of TKI discontinuation and depicted the patient by DNA and RNA sequencing to investigate intrinsic molecular features. The mutations of TGFBR2 and PCNT and the dysregulations of TGF-beta and other pathways might accelerate the B cell transformation, which may serve as a blast crisis risk indicator of CML. Single-cell transcriptome data revealed that several clusters of immature B cells and late pro-B cells presented clone evolution during the treatment. After failing multiple lines of TKIs, conditioning chemotherapies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) targeting CD19 and CD22 were performed to achieve remission. In conclusion, we report the first case of a CML patient with sudden lymphoid blast crisis after a long treatment-free remission and additional gene abnormalities other than BCR-ABL1 might participate in the progression, which need to be closely monitored, and CAR-T could be a solution to the chemoresistant progression.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Miao, Liu, Zhong, You, Tang, Li, Zhu and Guo.']","['Miao, Ya-Ru', 'Liu, Wen', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'You, Yong', 'Tang, Yutong', 'Li, Weiming', 'Zhu, Xiaojian', 'Guo, An-Yuan']","['Miao YR', 'Liu W', 'Zhong Z', 'You Y', 'Tang Y', 'Li W', 'Zhu X', 'Guo AY']","['Center for Artificial Intelligence Biology, Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Artificial Intelligence Biology, Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210921,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T', 'TGF-beta', 'blast crisis', 'discontinuation', 'single-cell sequencing']",2021/10/09 06:00,2021/10/09 06:01,['2021/10/08 07:11'],"['2021/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/08 07:11 [entrez]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.739871 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 21;11:739871. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.739871. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8490701,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of our study is to determine the association of AF with different cancer subtypes and its impact on in-hospital outcomes. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample database between 2005 and 2015. Patients with various cancers and AF were studied. ICD-9-CM codes were utilized to verify variables. Patients were divided into three age groups: Group 1 (age < 65 years), Group 2 (age 65-80 years), and Group 3 (age > 80 years). Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson chi-square and binary logistic regression analysis to determine the association of individual cancers with AF. Results: The prevalence of AF was 14.6% among total study patients (n = 46 030 380). After adjusting for confounding variables through multivariate regression analysis, AF showed significant association in Group 1 with lung cancer (odds ratio, OR = 1.92), multiple myeloma (OR = 1.59), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.55), respiratory cancer (OR = 1.55), prostate cancer (OR = 1.20), leukemia (OR = 1.12), and Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR = 1.03). In Group 2, the association of AF with multiple myeloma (1.21), lung cancer (OR = 1.15), Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.15), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.12), respiratory cancer (OR = 1.08), prostate cancer (OR = 1.06), leukemia (OR = 1.14), and colon cancer (OR = 1.01) were significant. In Group 3, AF showed significant association with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.06), prostate (OR = 1.03), leukemia (OR = 1.03), Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR = 1.02), multiple myeloma (OR = 1.01), colon cancer (OR = 1.01), and breast cancer (OR = 1.01). The highest mortality was found in lung cancer in age <80 and prostate cancer in age >80. Conclusion: In patients age <80 years, AF has significant association with lung cancer and multiple myeloma, whereas in patients age >80 years, it has significant association with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate cancer. In patients age <80 years, increased mortality was seen in AF with lung cancer and in patients age >80 years, increased mortality was seen in those with AF and prostate cancer. Twitter Abstract: In age <80, lung cancer and multiple myeloma have a strong association with AF while thyroid and pancreatic cancers have no association with AF at any age. In age greater than 80, NHL and prostate cancer have a significant association with AF.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The synthesis of twelve new compounds was performed in three steps and assisted by microwave irradiation in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to obtain 1,2,3-triazole derivatives substituted on carbon C-4 of the triazole nucleus. All compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562) that expresses the enzyme tyrosine kinase BCR-Abl-1 and against healthy cells (WSS-1) to observe their selectivity. Three compounds showed promising results, with IC50 values between 1.0 and 7.3 muM, and were subjected to molecular docking studies.

Cohesin core subunit genes are mutated across a wide cross-section of cancers, but not in germinal center (GC) derived lymphomas. In spite of this, haploinsufficiency of cohesin ATPase subunit Smc3 was shown to contribute to malignant transformation of GC B-cells in mice. Herein we explored potential mechanisms and clinical relevance of Smc3 deficiency in GC lymphomagenesis. Transcriptional profiling of Smc3 haploinsufficient murine lymphomas revealed downregulation of genes repressed by loss of epigenetic tumor suppressors Tet2 and Kmt2d. Profiling 3D chromosomal interactions in lymphomas revealed impaired enhancer-promoter interactions affecting genes like Tet2, which was aberrantly downregulated in Smc3 deficient lymphomas. Tet2 plays important roles in B-cell exit from the GC reaction, and single cell RNA-seq profiles and phenotypic trajectory analysis in Smc3 mutant mice revealed a specific defect in commitment to the final steps of plasma cell differentiation. Although Smc3 deficiency resulted in structural abnormalities in GC B-cells, there was no increase of somatic mutations or structural variants in Smc3 haploinsufficient lymphomas, suggesting that cohesin deficiency largely induces lymphomas through disruption of enhancer-promoter interactions of terminal differentiation and tumor suppressor genes. Strikingly, the presence of the Smc3 haploinsufficient GC B-cell transcriptional signature in human patients with GC-derived diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was linked to inferior clinical outcome and low expression of cohesin core subunits. Reciprocally, reduced expression of cohesin subunits was an independent risk factor for worse survival int DLBCL patient cohorts. Collectively, the data suggest that Smc3 functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor for lymphomas through non-genetic mechanisms, and drives disease by disrupting the commitment of GC B-cells to the plasma cell fate.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Rivas, Durmaz, Kloetgen, Chin, Chen, Bhinder, Koren, Viny,', 'Scharer, Boss, Elemento, Mason and Melnick.']","['Rivas, Martin A', 'Durmaz, Ceyda', 'Kloetgen,

Engraftment of HPSCs mainly depends on some factors such as adhesion molecules, including VLAs. This study tried to delineate the relationship between HPSCs engraftment and expression level of PSGL1 and VLA4, 5, and 6 genes in candidate MM patients for autologous bone marrow transplantation. Firstly, the CD 34+ HPSCs were collected from multiple myeloma (MM) patients after five days of G-CSF therapy through apheresis processes. Then, the patients were categorized into two groups of good and bad prognosis depending on engraftment time (Less or more than 18 days). Followingly, the expression of PSGL1 and VLA4, VLA5, and VLA6 genes were assessed by the qRT-PCR technique in each patient. Finally, the correlation between the genes and engraftment time was investigated to determine the prognostic role of each gene on HPSCs transplantation. Our findings demonstrated that there is a significant correlation between VLA4 (P=< 0.0001) and 5 (P = 0.005) levels and HPSCs engraftment time. As the higher levels of VLA4 and 5, the shorter time HPSCs engraftment occurs. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between VLA6 (P = 0.2) and PSGL1 (P = 0.3) genes levels and engraftment time. So that, the patients with a good prognosis had a higher level of VLA4 and VLA5, but no relation was found between VLA6 and PSGL1. It is concluded that VLA4 and VLA5 expression could be considered a significant prognostic factor for HPSC transplantation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this type of therapy has faced serious hindrances in combating T-cell neoplasms. R/R T-cell malignancies are generally associated with poor clinical outcomes, and the available effective treatment approaches are very limited. CAR-T therapy of T-cell malignancies has unique impediments in comparison with that of B-cell malignancies. Fratricide, T-cell aplasia, and product contamination with malignant T cells when producing autologous CAR-Ts are the most important challenges of CAR-T therapy in T-cell malignancies necessitating in-depth investigations. Herein, we highlight the preclinical and clinical efforts made for addressing these drawbacks and also review additional potent stratagems that could improve CAR-T therapy in T-cell malignancies.",['(c) 2021.

We aimed to examine the expression of the markers immune receptor translocation -associated protein 1 (IRTA1), myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF1) and stathmin1 in SBCL cases involving different sites which may have plasma cell differentiation. Materials and Methods: We studied 154 involved tissue samples, from 116 patients and evaluated the staining distribution of the markers. The expressions were evaluated on 21 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ lymphoma (CLL/SLL), 7 follicular lymphoma (FL), 14 nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), 17 extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (ENMZL), 55 splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), 22 marginal zone lymphoma -not otherwise specified (MZL-NOS) and 18 lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (LPL/WS) cases by immunohistochemistry. Results: The results confirmed that LEF1 was the most sensitive and specific markers for CLL/SLL and Stathmin for FL (p <0.001). MNDA and IRTA1 were useful markers to distinguish marginal zone lymphomas. Conclusion: Our results suggest LEF 1 for CLL/SLL and Stathmin for FL are reliable markers.

Methods: Eight-three donor specific anti-HLA antibody (DSA, 2000 </=MFI<10 000) positive patients who underwent haploidentical allograft were prospectively enrolled. Rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) was used for desensitization day-3 of conditioning regimen. Incidence and factors associated with PHR, including primary poor graft function and prolonged thrombocytopenia, were investigated. Results: There were 22 males and 61 females with a median age of 39(range: 1-65) years. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 100 day cumulative incidences of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 93.0% and 90.7%, respectively. The incidences of PHR were 14.7%.

These studies have helped improve risk classification and treatment options. Detailed molecular characterization of longitudinal AML samples is sparse, however; meanwhile, relapse and therapy resistance represent the main challenges in AML care. To this end, we performed transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing of longitudinal diagnosis, relapse, and/or primary resistant samples from 47 adult and 23 pediatric AML patients with known mutational background. Gene expression analysis revealed the association of short event-free survival with overexpression of GLI2 and IL1R1, as well as downregulation of ST18. Moreover, CR1 downregulation and DPEP1 upregulation were associated with AML relapse both in adults and children. Finally, machine learning-based and network-based analysis identified overexpressed CD6 and downregulated INSR as highly copredictive genes depicting important relapse-associated characteristics among adult patients with AML. Our findings highlight the importance of a tumor-promoting inflammatory environment in leukemia progression, as indicated by several of the herein identified differentially expressed genes.

As CAR T-cell therapy continues to evolve, infection risks and management thereof will become increasingly important to optimize outcomes across the spectrum of antigens and disease targeted. We retrospectively characterized infectious complications occurring in 162 children and adults treated among 5 phase 1 CAR T-cell clinical trials. Trials included targeting of CD19, CD22, disialoganglioside (GD2) or B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). Fifty-three patients (32.7%) had 76 infections between lymphocyte depleting (LD) chemotherapy and day 30 (D30); with the majority of infections (61, 80.3%) occurring between day 0 (D0) and D30. By trial, the highest proportion of infections was seen with CD22 CAR T cells (n = 23/53; 43.4%), followed by BCMA CAR T cells (n = 9/24; 37.5%). By disease, patients with multiple myeloma had the highest proportion of infections (9/24; 37.5%) followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36/102; 35.3%). Grade 4 infections were rare (n = 4; 2.5%). Between D0 and D30, bacteremia and bacterial site infections were the most common infection type. In univariate analysis, increasing prior lines of therapy, recent infection within 100 days of LD chemotherapy, corticosteroid or tocilizumab use, and fever and neutropenia were associated with a higher risk of infection. In a multivariable analysis, only prior lines of therapy and recent infection were associated with higher risk of infection.

Steroid-nonresponsive aGVHD is a significant problem for patients undergoing allo-HSCT, with <15% of these patients alive 1 year after diagnosis. Previously, we found that the infusion of donor innate lymphoid type 2 (ILC2) cells could prevent and treat aGVHD of the lower gastrointestinal tract with no effect on the graft-versus-leukemia response. This approach for clinical translation is cumbersome, as it would require the generation of donor-derived ILC2 cells for each recipient. Thus, the ability to use third-party ILC2 cells would provide an ""off-the-shelf"" reagent that could be used to treat and/or prevent aGVHD. Here, we show that third-party ILC2 cells enhance the survival of allo-HSCT recipients. Treatment required at least 4 weekly infusions of ILC2 cells. Mechanistically, we show that ILC2 cell function was completely lost if the cells could not express both interleukin-13 (IL-13) and amphiregulin. Finally, we show that the activity of IL-13 has a greater dependence on the expression of the IL-13R on host rather than donor bone marrow cells. The ability to generate third-party ILC2 cells offers a new avenue for the prevention of aGVHD.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

We retrospectively analyzed 687 HCT recipients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ciclosporin-based immunosuppression to better understand the differential impact of CMV on transplant outcomes depending on AML disease stage and in vivo T cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Without ATG, CMV reactivation associated with significantly reduced relapse, yet its effect was more pronounced for advanced disease AML (P = .0002) than for patients in first complete remission (CR1, P = .0169). Depending on the disease stage, ATG exposure abrogated relapse protection following CMV reactivation in advanced stages (P = .796), while it inverted its effect into increased relapse for CR1 patients (P = .0428). CMV reactivation was associated with significantly increased nonrelapse mortality in CR1 patients without ATG (P = .0187) but not in those with advanced disease and ATG. Following CMV reactivation, only patients with advanced disease had significantly higher event-free survival rates as compared with patients without CMV. Overall, our data suggest that both ATG and disease stage modulate the impact of post-HCT CMV reactivation in opposite directions, revealing a level of complexity that warrants future studies regarding the interplay between antivirus and antitumor immunity.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Several cancer treatments are recognized as risk factors for CVD, but specific therapies are unavailable. Many cancer treatments activate shared signaling events, which reprogram myeloid cells (MCs) towards persistent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and consequently CVD, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to provide mechanistic insights and potential treatments by investigating how chemo-radiation can induce persistent SASP. We generated ERK5 S496A knock-in mice and determined SASP in myeloid cells (MCs) by evaluating their efferocytotic ability, antioxidation-related molecule expression, telomere length, and inflammatory gene expression. Candidate SASP inducers were identified by high-throughput screening, using the ERK5 transcriptional activity reporter cell system. Various chemotherapy agents and ionizing radiation (IR) up-regulated p90RSK-mediated ERK5 S496 phosphorylation. Doxorubicin and IR caused metabolic changes with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion and ensuing mitochondrial stunning (reversible mitochondria dysfunction without showing any cell death under ATP depletion) via p90RSK-ERK5 modulation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation, which formed a nucleus-mitochondria positive feedback loop. This feedback loop reprogramed MCs to induce a sustained SASP state, and ultimately primed MCs to be more sensitive to reactive oxygen species. This priming was also detected in circulating monocytes from cancer patients after IR. When PARP activity was transiently inhibited at the time of IR, mitochondrial stunning, priming, macrophage infiltration, and coronary atherosclerosis were all eradicated. The p90RSK-ERK5 module plays a crucial role in SASP-mediated mitochondrial stunning via regulating PARP activation.

Dociparstat sodium (DSTAT, CX-01) is a low anticoagulant heparin with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis, blocking HMGB1, and binding platelet factor 4 (PF-4). We conducted a pilot study adding DSTAT to azacitidine for patients with AML or MDS unresponsive to or relapsed after prior hypomethylating agent therapy, hypothesizing that DSTAT may improve response rates. Twenty patients were enrolled, with a median of 2 prior lines of therapy and 6 cycles of prior hypomethylating agents. Among fifteen patients evaluable for response, there was 1 complete remission, and 3 marrow complete remissions, for a response rate of 27 % among evaluable patients (20 % overall). Hematologic improvement was observed in 5 additional patients. The median overall survival for all enrolled patients was 205 days (95 % CI 119-302). While cytopenias and infections were common, these were not out of proportion to what would be expected in this population of patients undergoing treatment with azacitidine alone.

METHODS: Previously untreated CLL patients age < 70 years received three cycles of ibrutinib and then 12 cycles of combined ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Patients in the MRD cohort who met the stringent random assignment criteria for confirmed undetectable MRD (Confirmed uMRD) were randomly assigned 1:1 to double-blind placebo or ibrutinib; patients without Confirmed uMRD (uMRD Not Confirmed) were randomly assigned 1:1 to open-label ibrutinib or ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Primary end point was 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate with placebo versus ibrutinib in the Confirmed uMRD population. Secondary end points included response rates, uMRD, and safety. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four patients initiated three cycles of ibrutinib lead-in. After 12 cycles of ibrutinib plus venetoclax, best uMRD response rates were 75% (peripheral blood) and 68% (bone marrow). Patients with Confirmed uMRD were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 43) or ibrutinib (n = 43); patients with uMRD Not Confirmed were randomly assigned to ibrutinib (n = 31) or ibrutinib plus venetoclax (n = 32). Median follow-up was 31.3 months. One-year DFS rate was not significantly different between placebo (95%) and ibrutinib (100%; arm difference: 4.7% [95% CI, -1.6 to 10.9]; P = .15) in the Confirmed uMRD population. After ibrutinib lead-in tumor debulking, 36 of 40 patients (90%) with high tumor lysis syndrome risk at baseline shifted to medium or low tumor lysis syndrome risk categories. Adverse events were most frequent during the first 6 months of ibrutinib plus venetoclax and generally decreased over time. CONCLUSION: The 1-year DFS rate of 95% in placebo-randomly assigned patients with Confirmed uMRD suggests the potential for fixed-duration treatment with this all-oral, once-daily, chemotherapy-free regimen in first-line CLL.",,"['Wierda, William G', 'Allan, John N', 'Siddiqi, Tanya', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Opat, Stephen', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Badoux, Xavier C', 'Kuss, Bryone J', 'Jackson, Sharon', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Jacobs, Ryan', 'Pagel, John M', 'Flinn, Ian', 'Pak, Yvonne', 'Zhou, Cathy', 'Szafer-Glusman, Edith', 'Ninomoto, Joi', 'Dean, James P', 'James, Danelle F', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Tam, Constantine S']","['Wierda WG', 'Allan JN', 'Siddiqi T', 'Kipps TJ', 'Opat S', 'Tedeschi A', 'Badoux XC', 'Kuss BJ', 'Jackson S', 'Moreno C', 'Jacobs R', 'Pagel JM', 'Flinn I', 'Pak Y', 'Zhou C', 'Szafer-Glusman E', 'Ninomoto J', 'Dean JP', 'James DF', 'Ghia P', 'Tam CS']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.', 'City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'UCSD Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, CA.', 'Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy.', 'Ministry of Health, Kogarah, NSW, Australia.', 'Flinders University and Medical Centre, Bedford Park, SA, Australia.', 'Middlemore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, NC.', 'Swedish Cancer Institute Center for Blood Disorders and Stem Cell Transplantation, Seattle, WA.', 'Sarah Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, TN.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', ""Peter MacCallum Cancer Center and St Vincent's Hospital and the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211007,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2021/10/08 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/10/07 17:16'],"['2022/12/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/07 17:16 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.21.00807 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Dec 1;39(34):3853-3865. doi: 10.1200/JCO.21.00807.

The aims of this study were to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of REC-2282 (AR-42) from the first-in-human (NCT01129193) and phase I acute myeloid leukemia trials (NCT01798901) and to evaluate potential sources of variability. Additionally, we sought to understand alternate body size descriptors as sources of inter-individual variability (IIV), which was significant for dose-normalized maximum observed concentration and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). METHODS: Datasets from two clinical trials were combined, and population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM and R softwares; patient demographics were tested as covariates. RESULTS: A successful population pharmacokinetic model was constructed. The pharmacokinetics of REC-2282 were best described by a two-compartment model with one transit compartment for absorption, first-order elimination and a proportional error model. Fat-free mass (FFM) was retained as a single covariate on clearance (CL), though it explained < 3% of the observed variability on CL. Tumor type and formulation were retained as covariates on lag time, and a majority of variability, attributed to absorption, remained unexplained. Computed tomography (CT)-derived lean body weight estimates were lower than estimated lean body weight and fat-free mass measures in most patients. Analysis of dose-normalized AUC vs. body size descriptors suggests flat dosing is most appropriate for REC-2282. CONCLUSIONS: FFM was identified as a significant covariate on CL; however, it explained only a very small portion of the IIV; major factors contributing significantly to REC-2282 pharmacokinetic variability remain unidentified.",['(c) 2021.

Our goal in this paper is to review the current data on TFR, and discuss future directions. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple studies have demonstrated that attempting a treatment-free remission is safe and effective in a select group of patients. More recent data suggested that undetectable BCR-ABL1 by digital PCR prior to discontinuation is highly predictive of successful TFR. However, some patients have a successful TFR with no evidence of clinical disease despite persistent detectable BCR-ABL1. Some recent studies have shed some more light on possible mechanisms for this phenomena. Some possible mechanisms include immune mechanism, BCR-ABL1 detected in the lymphoid component only, or stem cell exhaustion. TFR should be discussed with patients with CML. Patients who achieve a sustained deep molecular response may be eligible to attempt TFR, however, setting expectations that overall only 20% of patients with newly diagnosed CML will achieve a successful TFR. The importance of compliance to treatment early on cannot be overemphasized. Further studies using other drugs to get patients to a deeper remission in order to be eligible for TFR attempt, or attempting a second TFR in patients who had disease recurrence after first TFR attempt, are currently underway.","['(c) 2021.

While certainly there are benefits to taking a medication at home, this change in treatment modality also came with unique challenges, including patient adherence, medication acquisition and cost, and toxicity management. RECENT FINDINGS: Pharmacists are uniquely equipped to assist with educating patients, safe prescribing, and access to medications. Several studies have described the benefits of an integrated oral anticancer medication management program in the ambulatory setting, including improvements in patient adherence, side effect management, patient comprehension, and drug-interaction detection. Pharmacists are also specially trained to assist with medication dose adjustments, relative lab monitoring, and co-pay assistance. Here, we describe the multidisciplinary workflows established to manage oral therapies in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in a malignant hematology clinic at a large academic medical center. By using the unique talents of the clinic pharmacist, clinic nurse, and specialty retail pharmacy group, patients can be triaged to help ensure the correct skill set is used to optimally care for patients. An acuity-based monitoring structure can improve the ability to reach and safely monitor a large volume of patients.","['(c) 2021.

METHODS: We report the case of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with an NDM-5 producing Escherichia coli intra-abdominal infection where resistance to cefiderocol evolved approximately 2 weeks after initiating cefiderocol therapy. Through WGS investigations, mRNA expression studies, and EDTA inhibition analysis, we investigate the role of increased NDM-5 production and genetic mutations contributing to the development of cefiderocol resistance using 5 sequential clinical E. coli isolates obtained from the patient. RESULTS: blaNDM-5 genes were identified in all 5 isolates. Cefiderocol MICs were 2, 4, and >32 mcg/mL for isolates 1-2, 3, 4-5, respectively. WGS showed that isolates 1-3 contained a single copy of the blaNDM-5 gene, whereas isolates 4 and 5 had 5 copies and 10 copies of the blaNDM-5 gene on an IncFIA/FIB/IncFII plasmid, respectively. These findings correlated with NDM-5 mRNA expression analysis in which isolates 4 and 5 expressed NDM 1.7x and 2.8x greater than isolate 1. Synergy testing with the combination of ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam demonstrated expansion of the zone of inhibition between the disks for all isolates. The patient was eventually successfully treated with this combination and remained infection free 10 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient's case suggests that increased copy numbers of bla NDM genes through translocation events is used by Enterobacterales to evade cefiderocol-mediated cell death. The frequency of increased NDM expression in contributing to cefiderocol resistance needs investigation.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The results indicated low circCRKL expression in AML cell lines and samples. Moreover, the overexpression of circCRKL inhibited the proliferation and colony-forming ability of AML cells, while its silencing promoted them. In addition, bioinformatics tools and luciferase assays revealed that circCRKL could sponge miR-196a-5p and miR-196b-5p to promote the expression of p27.

Methods: Totally, 76 adult Ph(-) ALL patients and 30 healthy donors (HDs) were included. Bone marrow (BM) samples before therapy (baseline), after 4-week therapy of Ph(-) ALL patients and the BM samples of HDs were collected. Then, EIF3B expression in BM was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: EIF3B expression was increased in Ph(-) ALL patients compared with HDs, which distinguished Ph(-) ALL patients from HDs (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.928; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.882-0.974) by receiver operating characteristic curve. Furthermore, higher baseline EIF3B expression was associated with elevated white blood cell and bone marrow blasts, while it was associated with lower complete remission (CR) within 4 weeks and less allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant achievements in Ph(-) ALL patients. Additionally, higher baseline EIF3B expression was associated with decreased disease-free survival but not overall survival. However, it was associated with raised 1-year mortality and 3-year mortality in Ph(-) ALL patients. After 4-week therapy, EIF3B expression was reduced in total Ph(-) ALL patients.

B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) cases show various genetic/molecular abnormalities and varying frequencies of chimeric fusion transcripts in BCP-ALL cases are reported from different parts of the world. We studied the immunophenotypic aberrancy profiles of a large number of BCP-ALL cases with respect to various common chimeric fusion transcripts. Materials and Methods: Flowcytometric Immunophenotyping and Multiplex RT-PCR assay were performed in 986 BCP-ALL cases. Results: Among 986 BCP-ALL cases, the incidence of various fusion transcripts was 38.36% in adult cases and 20.68% in pediatric cases. Adult BCP-ALL cases harbouring t(9;22)(BCR-ABL1) fusion transcripts and having expression of aberrant myeloid markers, were significantly older at presentation (age, p=0.0218) and had male preponderance (male, p=0.0246), as compared to those without aberrant myeloid expression. In pediatric cases expressing t(12;21)(ETV6-RUNX1) chimeric fusion transcript, aberrant expression of CD13 was observed in 39.13%, CD33 in 36.95% and CD117 in 8.69% patients respectively. Pediatric BCP-ALL cases harbouring ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript and having expression of aberrant myeloid markers were not significantly different as compared to those without, with respect to their demographic and clinico-hematological characteristics (p=0.5955). Aberrant myeloid markers were rarely/never expressed in pediatric and adult BCP-ALL patients harbouring t(4;11)(KTM2A-AF4) and t(1;19)(TCF3-PBX1) fusion transcripts. Conclusion: Aberrant myeloid markers were frequently expressed among BCP-ALL patients harbouring t(9;22)(BCR-ABL1) and t(12;21)(ETV6-RUNX1) fusion transcripts. However BCP-ALL patients harbouring t(4;11)(KTM2A-AF4) and t(1;19)(TCF3-PBX1) fusion transcripts rarely/ never expressed aberrant myeloid markers. Aberrant myeloid CD markers can be used in predicting chimeric fusion transcripts at baseline, so as to plan desirable TKI therapy in BCP-ALL cases with specific chimeric fusion transcripts.

The advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed the identification of many mutated genes important in the pathogenesis of AML. AIMS: In this study, we aimed to assess the mutation types and frequency in a Chinese cohort presenting with de novo AML cohort using a targeted NGS strategy. METHODS: In total, we studied samples from 87 adult patients with de novo AML who had no prior history of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Samples were evaluated using a 120-gene targeted NGS panel to assess the mutation profile. RESULTS: Of the 87 AML patients, there were 60 (69%) with a normal karyotype. 89.7% of patients had variants, with an average of 1.9 mutations per patient (range: 0-5 mutations per patient). DNMT3A variants were the most common, being detected in 33 patients (37.9%). NPM1 (34.5%), IDH1/2 (24.1%) and FLT3-ITD (20.7%) mutations was the next most common. Of the patients with DNMT3A mutations, 24.2% also had mutations NPM1 and FLT3-ITD and 6.1% NPM1, FLT3-ITD and IDH mutations. CONCLUSION: Both DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations were more common than in other Chinese and Western AML cohorts that have been studied. DNMT3A mutations tended to co-occur with NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations and were most commonly seen with a normal karyotype.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

An in vitro study showed that enasidenib at clinically relevant concentrations has effects on multiple drug metabolic enzymes and transporters, including inhibition of P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion transporter (OAT) P1B1, and OATP1B3 transporters. Therefore, a drug-drug interaction study was conducted to assess the impact of enasidenib at steady state on the pharmacokinetics of several probe compounds in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, including the probes herein described in this article, digoxin and rosuvastatin. Results from 8 patients (all Asian) with a mean age of 67.1 years showed that following coadministration of enasidenib (100 mg, 28-day once-daily schedule) for 28 days (at steady state), digoxin's (0.25 mg) area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 30 days was 1.2-fold (90% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6), compared with digoxin alone. Following coadministration of enasidenib (100 mg, 28-day once-daily schedule) for 28 days (at steady state), rosuvastatin's (10 mg) area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity was 3.4-fold (90% confidence interval, 2.6-4.5) compared with rosuvastatin alone. These results should serve as the basis for dose recommendations for drugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 transporters, when used concomitantly with enasidenib.","['(c) 2021, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.']","['Cheng, Yiming', 'Wang, Xiaomin', 'Tong, Zeen', 'Reyes, Josephine', 'Carayannopoulos, Leon', 'Zhou, Simon', 'Li, Yan']","['Cheng Y', 'Wang X', 'Tong Z', 'Reyes J', 'Carayannopoulos L', 'Zhou S', 'Li Y']","['Clinical Pharmacology & Pharmacometrics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Summit, New Jersey, USA.', 'Nonclinical Research & Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Summit, New Jersey, USA.', 'Nonclinical Research & Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Summit, New Jersey, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology & Pharmacometrics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Summit, New Jersey, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology & Pharmacometrics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Summit, New Jersey, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology & Pharmacometrics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Summit, New Jersey, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology & Pharmacometrics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Summit, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211006,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BCRP', 'MDS', 'OATP1B1 and OATP1B3', 'P-gp', 'digoxin and rosuvastatin cocktail', 'drug-drug interactions', 'enasidenib']",2021/10/08 06:00,2021/10/08 06:00,['2021/10/07 07:10'],"['2021/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/07 07:10 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.1979 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Clin Pharmacol. 2021 Oct 6. doi: 10.1002/jcph.1979.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date most molecular data have been obtained from lymphomas arising in the young. Recently, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive and negative BL in young patients was shown to differ in molecular features. In the present study, we present a large age-overarching cohort of sporadic BL (n = 162) analysed by immunohistochemistry, translocations of MYC proto-oncogene, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (MYC), B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and by targeted sequencing. We illustrate an age-associated inter-tumoral molecular heterogeneity in this disease. Mutations affecting inhibitor of DNA binding 3, HLH protein (ID3), transcription factor 3 (TCF3) and cyclin D3 (CCND3), which are highly recurrent in paediatric BL, and expression of sex determining region Y-box transcription factor 11 (SOX11) declined with patient age at diagnosis (P = 0.0204 and P = 0.0197 respectively). In contrast, EBV was more frequently detected in adult patients (P = 0.0262). Irrespective of age, EBV-positive sporadic BL showed significantly less frequent mutations in ID3/TCF3/CCND3 (P = 0.0088) but more often mutations of G protein subunit alpha 13 (GNA13; P = 0.0368) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1; P = 0.0044) compared to EBV-negative tumours. Our findings suggest that among sporadic BL an EBV-positive subgroup of lymphomas increases with patient age that shows distinct pathogenic features reminiscent of EBV-positive endemic BL.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We analyzed treatment outcomes of blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) as first- or second-line salvage therapy in nine patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor ALL presenting with isolated EMR after previous allo-HCT. In seven patients receiving blinatumomab as first-line salvage therapy, 4 (57.1%) achieved complete remission (CR). Among the three patients without remission after blinatumomab, two switched to INO and subsequently showed responses {one CR and one partial response [PR]}, and one switched to multiagent chemotherapy that led to CR. In the two patients receiving first-line salvage therapy with INO, one showed PR and the other achieved CR. Overall, 6 (66.7%) of nine patients achieved CR, and five of them proceeded to allo-HCT in CR. The median overall survival after relapse was 27.8 months. In conclusion, both blinatumomab and INO showed good response rates and a safe bridging role to second allo-HCT in patients with isolated EMR.

Tris(1,10-phenanthroline)tris(thiocyanato-kappaN)lanthanum(III) (KP772) is an experimental antineoplastic agent to which multidrug-resistant cell models have shown hypersensitivity. Antiproliferative and apoptotic activities of KP772 were tested in leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumor cell lines as well as primary leukemia cells (isolated from the bone marrow of a child with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The ability to overcome drug resistances was investigated in doxorubicin- and vincristine-resistant cell lines. Real-time PCR was used to gain insight into the mechanism of apoptosis induction. KP772 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in various leukemia and lymphoma cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner (LC50 = 1-2.5 microM). Primary AML cells were also sensitive to KP772, whereas daunorubicin showed no significant effect. KP772 induces apoptosis independently of Bcl-2, Smac, and the CD95 receptor and is also effective in caspase 3-deficient MCF7 cells, indicating that apoptosis is partly triggered independently of caspase 3. mRNA expression profiling revealed an upregulation of the BH3-only Bcl-2 protein Harakiri in the course of KP772-induced apoptosis. Remarkably, KP772 overcame drug resistance to doxorubicin and vincristine in vitro, and the apoptotic effect in resistant cells was even superior to that in non-resistant parental cells. In combination with vincristine, doxorubicin and cytarabine, synergistic effects were observed in BJAB cells. The cytotoxic potency in vitro/ex vivo and the remarkable ability to overcome multidrug resistance propose KP772 as a promising candidate drug for antileukemic therapy, especially of drug-refractory malignancies.Graphic abstract.",['(c) 2021.

While most of the mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 can be successfully managed, the recurrent somatic mutations in other genes may be therapeutically challenging. Despite the major clinical relevance of mutation-associated resistance in CML, the mechanisms underlying mutation acquisition in TKI-treated leukemic cells are not well understood. This work demonstrated de novo acquisition of mutations on isolated single-cell sorted CML clones growing in the presence of imatinib. The acquisition of mutations was associated with the significantly increased expression of the LIG1 and PARP1 genes involved in the error-prone alternative nonhomologous end-joining pathway, leading to genomic instability, and increased expression of the UNG, FEN and POLD3 genes involved in the base-excision repair (long patch) pathway, allowing point mutagenesis. This work showed in vitro and in vivo that de novo acquisition of resistance-associated mutations in oncogenes is the prevalent method of somatic mutation development in CML under TKIs treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Curik, Polivkova, Burda, Koblihova, Laznicka, Kalina,', 'Kanderova, Brezinova, Ransdorfova, Karasova, Rejlova, Bakardjieva, Kuzilkova,', 'Kundrat, Linhartova, Klamova, Salek, Klener, Hrusak and Machova Polakova.']","['Curik, Nikola', 'Polivkova, Vaclava', 'Burda, Pavel', 'Koblihova, Jitka', 'Laznicka, Adam', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Kanderova, Veronika', 'Brezinova, Jana', 'Ransdorfova, Sarka', 'Karasova, Dominika', 'Rejlova, Katerina', 'Bakardjieva, Marina', 'Kuzilkova, Daniela', 'Kundrat, David', 'Linhartova, Jana', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Machova Polakova, Katerina']","['Curik N', 'Polivkova V', 'Burda P', 'Koblihova J', 'Laznicka A', 'Kalina T', 'Kanderova V', 'Brezinova J', 'Ransdorfova S', 'Karasova D', 'Rejlova K', 'Bakardjieva M', 'Kuzilkova D', 'Kundrat D', 'Linhartova J', 'Klamova H', 'Salek C', 'Klener P', 'Hrusak O', 'Machova Polakova K']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine-Department of Hematology, Charles University General Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechia.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210920,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['TKI resistance', 'alt-nonhomologous end joining (alt-NHEJ)', 'base excision repair (BER)', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)', 'oncogene']",2021/10/08 06:00,2021/10/08 06:01,['2021/10/07 06:59'],"['2021/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/07 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.744373 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 20;11:744373. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.744373. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['HK was a consultant for and received honoraria from Novartis.

We apply a machine learning framework to dissect the relative contribution of centrally reviewed dysplastic features and oncogenetics in 190 patients with de novo AML treated in ALFA clinical trials. One hundred and thirty-five (71%) patients achieved complete response after the first induction course (CR). Dysgranulopoiesis, dyserythropoiesis and dysmegakaryopoiesis were assessable in 84%, 83% and 63% patients, respectively. Multi-lineage dysplasia was present in 27% of assessable patients. Micromegakaryocytes (q = 0.01), hypolobulated megakaryocytes (q = 0.08) and hyposegmented granulocytes (q = 0.08) were associated with higher ELN-2017 risk. Using a supervised learning algorithm, the relative importance of morphological variables (34%) for the prediction of CR was higher than demographic (5%), clinical (2%), cytogenetic (25%), molecular (29%), and treatment (5%) variables. Though dysplasias had limited predictive impact on survival, a multivariate logistic regression identified the presence of hypolobulated megakaryocytes (p = 0.014) and micromegakaryocytes (p = 0.035) as predicting lower CR rates, independently of monosomy 7 (p = 0.013), TP53 (p = 0.004), and NPM1 mutations (p = 0.025). Assessment of these specific dysmegakarypoiesis traits, for which we identify a transcriptomic signature, may thus guide treatment allocation in AML.","['(c) 2021.

At this time, he had left pleural effusion. He received two courses of inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) and achieved second hematological CR, but the left pleural effusion worsened over time, suggesting poor disease control. After changing the regimen to blinatumomab, aspiration biopsy cytology showed that the blasts in the pleural fluid disappeared and respiratory distress improved after one course of treatment. Flow cytometry results showed increased populations of CD3-positive T-cells, suggesting that blinatumomab may have migrated into the pleural fluid and exerted an antitumor effect.

BPDCN occurs at least three times more frequently in men than in women, but the reasons for this sex bias are unknown. Here, studying genomics of primary BPDCN and modeling disease-associated mutations, we link acquired alterations in RNA splicing to abnormal pDC development and inflammatory response through Toll-like receptors. Loss-of-function mutations in ZRSR2, an X chromosome gene encoding a splicing factor, are enriched in BPDCN, and nearly all mutations occur in males. ZRSR2 mutation impairs pDC activation and apoptosis after inflammatory stimuli, associated with intron retention and inability to upregulate the transcription factor IRF7. In vivo, BPDCN-associated mutations promote pDC expansion and signatures of decreased activation. These data support a model in which male-biased mutations in hematopoietic progenitors alter pDC function and confer protection from apoptosis, which may impair immunity and predispose to leukemic transformation. SIGNIFICANCE: Sex bias in cancer is well recognized, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely defined. We connect X chromosome mutations in ZRSR2 to an extremely male-predominant leukemia. Aberrant RNA splicing induced by ZRSR2 mutation impairs dendritic cell inflammatory signaling, interferon production, and apoptosis, revealing a sex- and lineage-related tumor suppressor

However, the biological roles of key lncRNAs in the development of NPM1-mutated AML are currently unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the functional and mechanistic roles of the lncRNA HOTAIRM1 in NPM1-mutated AML. METHODS: The expression of HOTAIRM1 was analyzed with a public database and further determined by qRT-PCR in NPM1-mutated AML samples and cell lines. The cause of upregulated HOTAIRM1 expression was investigated by luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays. The functional role of HOTAIRM1 in autophagy and proliferation was evaluated using western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, a 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, flow cytometric analyses and animal studies. The action mechanism of HOTAIRM1 was explored through RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: HOTAIRM1 was highly expressed in NPM1-mutated AML. High HOTAIRM1 expression was induced in part by mutant NPM1 via KLF5-dependent transcriptional regulation. Importantly, HOTAIRM1 promoted autophagy and proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that nuclear HOTAIRM1 promoted EGR1 degradation by serving as a scaffold to facilitate MDM2-EGR1 complex formation, while cytoplasmic HOTAIRM1 acted as a sponge for miR-152-3p to increase ULK3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings identify two oncogenic regulatory axes in NPM1-mutated AML centered on HOTAIRM1: one involving EGR1 and MDM2 in the nucleus and the other involving the miR-152-3p/ULK3 axis in the cytoplasm. Our study indicates that HOTAIRM1 may be a promising therapeutic target for this distinct leukemia subtype.",['(c) 2021.

In certain solid cancers, including breast and lung, tumor genome profiling has been incorporated into therapeutic decision-making. For chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), while tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is the standard treatment, current clinical scoring systems cannot accurately predict the heterogeneous treatment outcomes observed in patients. Biomarkers capable of segregating patients according to outcome at diagnosis are needed to improve management, and facilitate enrolment in clinical trials seeking to prevent blast crisis transformation and improve the depth of molecular responses. To this end, gene expression (GE) profiling studies have evaluated whether GE signatures at diagnosis are clinically informative. Patient material from a variety of sources have been profiled using microarrays, RNA sequencing, and, more recently, single-cell RNA sequencing. However, differences in the cell types profiled, the technologies used, and the inherent complexities associated with the interpretation of genomic data, pose challenges in distilling GE datasets into biomarkers with clinical utility. The goal of this paper is to review previous studies evaluating GE profiling in CML, and explore their potential as risk assessment tools for individualized CML treatment. We also review the contribution that acquired mutations, including those seen in clonal hematopoiesis, make to GE profiles, and how a model integrating contributions of genetic and epigenetic factors in TKI resistance and BC transformation can define a route to GE-based biomarkers. Finally, we outline a four-stage approach for the development of GE-based biomarkers in CML.",,"['Krishnan, Vaidehi', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Branford, Susan', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Krishnan V', 'Kim DDH', 'Hughes TP', 'Branford S', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore; International Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Foundation.', 'International Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Foundation; Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto.', 'International Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Foundation; School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia; Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide.', 'International Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Foundation; School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia; School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore; International Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Foundation; Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore; Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore; Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. sintiong.ong@duke-nus.edu.sg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211007,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2021/10/08 06:00,2021/10/08 06:00,['2021/10/07 02:27'],"['2021/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/07 02:27 [entrez]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2021.279317 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Oct 7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2021.279317.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor gilteritinib is approved for the treatment of relapse/refractory AML with FLT3 mutations, yet resistance to gilteritinib remains a clinical concern, and the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Using transcriptomic analyses and functional validation studies, we identified the calcium-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9 (S100A8/A9) as contributors to gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-ITD+ AML. Exposure of FLT3-ITD+ AML cells to gilteritinib increased S100A8/A9 expression in vivo and in vitro and decreased free calcium levels, and genetic manipulation of S100A9 was associated with altered sensitivity to gilteritinib. Using a transcription factor screen, we identified the transcriptional corepressor BCL6, as a regulator of S100A9 expression and found that gilteritinib decreased BCL6 binding to the S100A9 promoter, thereby increasing S100A9 expression. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of BCL6 accelerated the growth rate of gilteritinib-resistant FLT3-ITD+ AML cells, suggesting that S100A9 is a functional target of BCL6. These findings shed light on mechanisms of resistance to gilteritinib through regulation of a target that can be therapeutically exploited to enhance the antileukemic effects of gilteritinib.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, the prognostic implications of various immune cells in patients with MDS remain unclear. We adopted CIBERSORTx to estimate the relative fractions of 22 subtypes of immune cells in the BM of 316 patients with MDS and correlated the results with clinical outcomes. A lower fraction of unpolarized M0 macrophages and higher fractions of M2 macrophages and eosinophils were significantly associated with inferior survival. An immune cell scoring system (ICSS) was constructed based on the proportion of these 3 immune cells in the BM. The ICSS high-risk patients had higher BM blast counts, higher frequencies of poor-risk cytogenetics, and more NPM1, TP53, and WT1 mutations than intermediate- and low-risk patients. The ICSS could stratify patients with MDS into 3 risk groups with distinct leukemia-free survival and overall survival among the total cohort and in the subgroups of patients with lower and higher disease risk based on the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). The prognostic significance of ICSS was also validated in another independent cohort. Multivariable analysis revealed that ICSS independently predicted prognosis, regardless of age, IPSS-R, and mutation status. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between high-risk ICSS and nuclear factor kappaB signaling, oxidative stress, and leukemic stem cell signature pathways. Further studies investigating the mechanistic insight into the crosstalk between stem cells and immune cells are warranted.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

This phase 1 study investigated the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of venetoclax, a BCL-2 selective inhibitor, when added to FluBu2 in adult patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) undergoing transplant. Patients received dose-escalated venetoclax (200-400 mg daily starting day -8 for 6-7 doses) in combination with fludarabine 30 mg/m2 per day for 4 doses and busulfan 0.8 mg/kg twice daily for 8 doses on day -5 to day -2 (FluBu2). Transplant related-toxicity was evaluated from the first venetoclax dose on day -8 to day 28. Twenty-two patients were treated. At study entry, 5 patients with MDS and MDS/MPN had 5% to 10% marrow blasts, and 18 (82%) of 22 had a persistent detectable mutation. Grade 3 adverse events included mucositis, diarrhea, and liver transaminitis (n = 3 each). Neutrophil/platelet recovery and acute/chronic graft-versus-host-disease rates were similar to those of standard FluBu2. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The RP2D of venetoclax was 400 mg daily for 7 doses. With a median follow-up of 14.7 months (range, 8.6-24.8 months), median overall survival was not reached, and progression-free survival was 12.2 months (95% confidence interval, 6.0-not estimable). In patients with high-risk AML, MDS, and MDS/MPN, adding venetoclax to FluBu2 was feasible and safe. To further address relapse risk, assessment of maintenance therapy after venetoclax plus FluBu2 transplant is ongoing.

Here we demonstrate that human primary bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) successfully adapt to l-asparaginase and markedly protect leukemic blasts from the enzyme-dependent cytotoxicity through an amino acid trade-off. ALL blasts synthesize and secrete glutamine, thus increasing extracellular glutamine availability for stromal cells. In turn, MSCs use glutamine, either synthesized through glutamine synthetase (GS) or imported, to produce asparagine, which is then extruded to sustain asparagine-auxotroph leukemic cells. GS inhibition prevents mesenchymal cells adaptation to l-asparaginase, lowers glutamine secretion by ALL blasts, and markedly hinders the protection exerted by MSCs on leukemic cells. The pro-survival amino acid exchange is hindered by the inhibition or silencing of the asparagine efflux transporter SNAT5, which is induced in mesenchymal cells by ALL blasts. Consistently, primary MSCs from ALL patients express higher levels of SNAT5 (P < .05), secrete more asparagine (P < .05), and protect leukemic blasts (P < .05) better than MSCs isolated from healthy donors. In conclusion, ALL blasts arrange a pro-leukemic amino acid trade-off with bone marrow mesenchymal cells, which depends on GS and SNAT5 and promotes leukemic cell survival during l-asparaginase treatment.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, IMiDs are known to be inherently unstable, readily undergoing hydrolysis in body fluids. Here we show that IMiDs and IMiD-based PROTACs rapidly hydrolyze in commonly utilized cell media, which significantly affects their cell efficacy. We designed novel CRBN binders, phenyl glutarimide (PG) analogues, and showed that they retained affinity for CRBN with high ligand efficiency (LE >0.48) and displayed improved chemical stability. Our efforts led to the discovery of PG PROTAC 4 c (SJ995973), a uniquely potent degrader of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins that inhibited the viability of human acute myeloid leukemia MV4-11 cells at low picomolar concentrations (IC50 =3 pM; BRD4 DC50 =0.87 nM).

Since the authors' review of the topic in Cancer in 2018, numerous discoveries have been made that have improved the therapy and outcomes of several leukemia subsets. Hairy cell leukemia is potentially curable with a single course of cladribine followed by rituximab (10-year survival, >/=90%). Acute promyelocytic leukemia is curable at a rate of 80% to 90% with a nonchemotherapy regimen of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide. The cure rate for core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is >/=75% with fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Survival for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia is close to that for an age-matched normal population with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a previously incurable disease, may now be potentially curable with a finite duration of therapy with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and venetoclax. The estimated 5-year survival rate for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeds 70% with intensive chemotherapy and ponatinib, a third-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI, and more recent nonchemotherapy regimens using dasatinib or ponatinib with blinatumomab are producing outstanding results. Survival in both younger and older patients with ALL has improved with the addition of antibodies targeting CD20, CD19 (blinatumomab), and CD22 (inotuzumab) to chemotherapy. Several recent drug discoveries (venetoclax, FLT3 and IDH inhibitors, and oral hypomethylating agents) are also improving outcomes for younger and older patients with AML and for those with higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Welch, Mary Alma', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Wierda, William G', 'Jabbour, Elias J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Jain N', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Welch MA', 'Ravandi F', 'Wierda WG', 'Jabbour EJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211006,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['leukemia', 'prognosis', 'progress', 'therapy', 'updates']",2021/10/07 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2021/10/06 17:34'],"['2021/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/01/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/06 17:34 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33933 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2022 Jan 15;128(2):240-259. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33933.

The collectivist cultural norms of Asian societies may lead Chinese parents to have unique concerns regarding infertility. This qualitative study explored the perceptions of infertility risk and parenthood among parents of childhood cancer survivors in Hong Kong. Methods: Thirteen parents were recruited via a snowball sampling approach from a nongovernmental organization in Hong Kong, representing nine survivors of childhood cancer (leukemia n = 5, solid tumors n = 4). The in-depth semistructured interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was performed using ATLAS.ti 8. Results: Parents mostly perceived their children's fertility status as a distant concern (n = 11, 85%) but emphasized the need for timely information from clinicians when their children reach young adulthood (n = 8, 62%). They reported receiving inconsistent fertility information from different oncology practitioners (n = 9, 69%). A few parents acknowledged that under the influence of the Chinese culture, their children, especially sons, have an important duty to continue the family lineage. However, even if the cancer treatment were associated with infertility risk, almost all parents (n = 12, 92%) stated that it would still not affect their willingness to let their child undergo treatment because survival and cure were still their highest priority. Conclusion: Our findings suggest the need to proactively provide fertility information to parents both during active treatment and when survivors reach reproductive age. Future studies should evaluate the benefits of developing culturally relevant decision-making aids to address parents' informational needs regarding fertility issues.",,"['Cheng, Ho Yu', 'Chau, Ho Cheung', 'Cheung, Cedric Ka Chun', 'Yang, Lok Sum', 'Lee, Samantha Lai-Ka', 'Leung, Alex Wing Kwan', 'Li, Chi Kong', 'Lam, Teddy Tai Ning', 'Yeung, Nelson Chun Yiu', 'Cheung, Yin Ting']","['Cheng HY', 'Chau HC', 'Cheung CKC', 'Yang LS', 'Lee SL', 'Leung AWK', 'Li CK', 'Lam TTN', 'Yeung NCY', 'Cheung YT']","['The Nethersole School of Nursing, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', ""Department of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Hong Kong Hub of Paediatric Excellence, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', ""Department of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Hong Kong Hub of Paediatric Excellence, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Little Life Warriors Society Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211005,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chinese childbearing perception', 'Chinese parents', 'cancer treatment-related infertility', 'childhood cancer survivors', 'fertility preservation']",2021/10/07 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2021/10/06 17:18'],"['2021/10/06 17:18 [entrez]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jayao.2021.0106 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Oct 5. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2021.0106.,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5842-9390', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9874-8938']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes have broad temporal and spatial expression in many organs, resulting in complex phenotypes observed in KS patients. Hypotonia is one of the clinical presentations associated with KS, yet detailed examination of skeletal muscle samples from KS patients has not been reported. We studied the consequences of loss of KMT2D function in both mouse and human muscles. In mice, heterozygous loss of Kmt2d resulted in reduced neuromuscular junction (NMJ) perimeter, decreased muscle cell differentiation in vitro and impaired myofiber regeneration in vivo. Muscle samples from KS patients of different ages showed presence of increased fibrotic tissue interspersed between myofiber fascicles, which was not seen in mouse muscles. Importantly, when Kmt2d-deficient muscle stem cells were transplanted in vivo in a physiologic non-Kabuki environment, their differentiation potential is restored to levels undistinguishable from control cells. Thus, the epigenetic changes due to loss of function of KMT2D appear reversible through a change in milieu, opening a potential therapeutic avenue.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The application of NGS-guided disease prognostication and clinical decision making requires a basic understanding of sequencing advantages, pitfalls, and areas where clinical care might be enhanced by the knowledge generated. This article identifies avenues within the landscape of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) where mutational data hold the opportunity to enhance understanding of disease biology and patient care. RECENT FINDINGS: NGS-based assessment of measurable residual disease (MRD) after ALL treatment allows for a sensitive and specific molecular survey that is at least comparable, if not superior, to existing techniques. Mutational assessment by NGS has unraveled complex signaling networks that drive pathogenesis of T-cell ALL. Sequencing of patients with familial clustering of ALL has also identified novel germline mutations whose inheritance predisposes to disease development in successive generations. While NGS-based assessment of hematopoietic malignancies often provides actionable information to clinicians, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are left underserved due to a lack of disease classification and prognostication schema that integrate molecular data. Ongoing research is positioned to enrich the molecular toolbox available to clinicians caring for adult ALL patients and deliver new insights to guide therapeutic selection, monitor clinical response, and detect relapse.","['(c) 2021.

It is of great importance to identify novel and effective molecular markers to predict prognosis for the treatment of HCC. The Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) gene is well known to fuse with various partner genes and involved in promoting the development of multiple sarcomas, especially the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors. Nevertheless, seldom studies have focused on the role of EWSR1 in cancers of epithelial origin, let alone in HCC. In the current study, the transcriptional and clinical data of EWSR1 in HCC patients were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases, as well as 124 cases from the department of Pathology of Sichuan Jianyang People's Hospital. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were used to assess patient prognosis. EWSR1 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues (P < 0.001). The TCGA database analysis showed upregulation of EWSR1 was associated with histological grade, pathologic T stage and death, in addition to that, the T staging, N staging, TNM staging, Ki67, AFP expression were extremely higher in the EWSR1 over-expression group in our cohort. Univariate and multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis results revealed that EWSR1 was an independent prognostic factor for OS in HCC, and bioinformatics analysis showed RNA splicing process represented the major function and pathway. In conclusion, our data showed EWSR1 could serve as a novel promising prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.Abbreviations: AFP, Alpha-fetoprotein; CCL14, C-C motif chemokine ligand 14; CK19, Cytokeratin 19; CI, coefficient interval; COL1A1, Collagen 1A1; DFS, Disease-free Survival; EWSR1, Ewing Sarcoma breakpoint region 1/EWS RNA binding protein 1; FLI1, Friend leukemia virus integration 1; GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus; GO, Gene Ontology; HCC, Hepatocellular carcinoma; HR, Hazard ratio; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; mRNA, messenger Ribonucleic Acid; N, nodule; OS, Overall survival; PPI, Protein-Protein Interaction analysis; RNA, Ribonucleic Acid; SD, Standard Deviation; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; T, tumor; TNM, tumor-nodule-metastasis.",,"['Jiang, Weijie', 'Wu, Tao', 'Shi, Xuan', 'Xu, Jiawen']","['Jiang W', 'Wu T', 'Shi X', 'Xu J']","[""Department of Pathology, The People's Hospital of Jianyang City, Jianyang, Sichuan, 641499, China."", ""Department of Pathology, The People's Hospital of Jianyang City, Jianyang, Sichuan, 641499, China."", ""Department of Pathology, The People's Hospital of Jianyang City, Jianyang, Sichuan, 641499, China."", 'Department of Pathology, Shandong Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shandong Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*EWSR1', '*Hepatocellular carcinoma', '*bioinformatics analysis', '*prognostic marker']",2021/10/07 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2021/10/06 12:19'],"['2021/10/06 12:19 [entrez]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21655979.2021.1982844 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2021 Dec;12(1):7941-7949. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2021.1982844.,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urothelial cancer-associated 1 (UCA1) functions as an oncogene in the development of acute myeloid leukemia. However, the association between DNMT1 and UCA1 with benzene or HQ exposure has not been explored. We characterized UCA1 expression in cells briefly exposed to HQ (HQ-ST cells) and HQ-induced malignantly transformed (TK6-HT cells) treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzaC) or trichostatin A (TSA). Compared to that in control cells, UCA1 expression was increased, whereas DNMT1 was decreased in HQ-ST cells and TK6-HT cells treated with 5-AzaC or TSA. Moreover, UCA1 expression was also upregulated and positively correlated with benzene exposure time in benzene-exposed workers. Furthermore, the expression of UCA1 was negatively associated with the DNA methylation level of its promoter in benzene-exposed workers. DNMT1 rather than DNMT3b knockout in TK6-HT cells activated the expression of UCA1 by inducing its promoter hypomethylation. These results suggest that benzene or HQ exposure leads to UCA1 upregulation via DNA hypomethylation in the UCA1 promoter, which is mediated by DNMT1.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Pan, Zhijie', 'Zhong, Bohuan', 'Ling, Xiaoxuan', 'Zhang, Haiqiao', 'Tan, Qiang', 'Huang, Dongsheng', 'Chen, Jialong', 'Zhang, He', 'Zheng, Dongyan', 'Li, Huifang', 'Chen, Xiaobing', 'Liu, Linhua']","['Pan Z', 'Zhong B', 'Ling X', 'Zhang H', 'Tan Q', 'Huang D', 'Chen J', 'Zhang H', 'Zheng D', 'Li H', 'Chen X', 'Liu L']","['Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Hospital Infection Management, Dongguan Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, Dongguan, China.', 'Integrated Services Division, Foshan Institute of Occupational Disease Prevention and Control, Foshan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shenzhen Longhua District Central Hospital, Shenzhen, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211006,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'DNMT1', 'UCA1', 'benzene', 'hydroquinone']",2021/10/07 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2021/10/06 08:56'],"['2021/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/06 08:56 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.22920 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2021 Dec;35(12):e22920. doi: 10.1002/jbt.22920.

They are used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphomas and in food industries. Increasing demand for L-ASNases is therefore needed. In the current study, the recombinant L-ASNase from Dickeya chrysanthemi (DcL-ASNase) was cloned into pET28a (+) expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli as a 6His-tagged fusion protein and purified using Ni(2+) chelated Sepharose chromatography resin, yielding a highly purified enzyme. Kinetics analysis allowed the determination of its substrate specificity and the physicochemical parameters that affect enzyme activity. The enzyme showed operational stability at 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C. The immunogenicity of the purified DcL-ASNase was evaluated by measuring the IgG and IgM levels in rats after injection. The cytotoxicity DcL-ASNase in selected cancer cell lines and peripheral blood monocytes was determined. The results showed that the enzyme induces pleiotropic effects, including significant morphological changes and the formation of apoptotic bodies. No cytotoxic effects were observed in peripheral blood monocytes at the same concentrations. In addition, gene expression analysis by RT-PCR of apoptotic biomarkers (Bax, survivin, and Ki-67) allowed the study of the apoptotic mechanism induced by DcL-ASNase on THP-1 cells.",,"['Saeed, Hesham', 'Elsawy, Eman', 'Shalaby, Manal', 'Abdel-Fattah, Manal', 'Hemida, Asmaa', 'Eldoksh, Ahmad', 'Ataya, Farid Shokry', 'Nematalla, Hesham', 'Elkewedi, Mohamed', 'Labrou, Nikolaos N', 'El-Nikhely, Nefertiti']","['Saeed H', 'Elsawy E', 'Shalaby M', 'Abdel-Fattah M', 'Hemida A', 'Eldoksh A', 'Ataya FS', 'Nematalla H', 'Elkewedi M', 'Labrou NN', 'El-Nikhely N']","['Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Graduate Studies and Research, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'City of Scientific Research and Technological Applications, New Borg El-Arab, Egypt.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Graduate Studies and Research, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Graduate Studies and Research, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Graduate Studies and Research, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Damanhour University, Damanhour, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Health Sciences Technology, Pharos University in Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Graduate Studies and Research, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211006,England,Prep Biochem Biotechnol,Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,9607037,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'L. asparaginase', 'cloning', 'expression', 'hepatotoxicity', 'pancreatitis']",2021/10/07 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2021/10/06 08:46'],"['2021/10/06 08:46 [entrez]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10826068.2021.1983831 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Prep Biochem Biotechnol. 2021 Oct 6:1-13. doi: 10.1080/10826068.2021.1983831.,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1925-9867'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Translation of these advances to the patient's bedside for AI assisted interventions is not yet the norm. With specific emphasis on CLL, here, we review the progress of prognostic models in hematology and highlight sources of stagnation that may be limiting significant improvements in prognostication in the near future. We discuss issues related to performance, trust, modeling simplicity, and prognostic marker robustness and find that the major limiting factor in progressing toward state-of-the-art prognostication within the hematological community, is not the lack of able AI algorithms but rather, the lack of their adoption. Current models in CLL still deal with the 'average' patient while the use of patient-centric approaches remains absent.

This prospective phase II, open-label, multicenter study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of two hematologic growth factors, recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in combination with decitabine, cytarabine, and aclarubicin (D-CTAG regimen) to treat older adults with newly diagnosed AML (Identifier: NCT04168138). The above agents were administered as follows: decitabine (15 mg/m(2) daily, days 1-5); low-dose cytarabine (10 mg/m(2) q12 h, days 3-9); rhTPO (15,000 U daily, days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10-24 or until >50x10(9)/L platelets); aclarubicin (14 mg/m(2) daily, days 3-6); and G-CSF (300 mug daily, days 2-9). We concurrently monitored historic controls treated with decitabine followed by cytarabine, aclarubicin, and G-CSF (D-CAG) only. After the first D-CTAG cycle, the overall response rate (ORR) was 84.2% (16/19), including 13 (73.7%) complete remissions (CRs) and three (15.8%) partial remissions. This CR rate surpassed that of the D-CAG treatment (p < 0.05). Median overall survival (OS) time in the D-CTAG group was 20.2 months (range, 4-31 months), compared with 14 months in the D-CAG group, and 1-year OS was 78%. The proportion of those experiencing grade III-IV thrombocytopenia was significantly lower for D-CTAG (57.9%) than for D-CAG (88.4%; p < 0.05). Ultimately, the curative effect of adding rhTPO was not inferior to that of D-CAG, and D-CTAG proved safer for elderly patients, especially in terms of hematologic toxicity. A prospective phase III randomized study is warranted to confirm these observations.",['(c) 2021 Liu et al.'],"['Liu, Xiaoyu', 'Shi, Hua', 'Shen, Jing', 'Li, Yang', 'Yan, Wei', 'Sun, Ying', 'Liao, Aijun', 'Tan, Yehui', 'Yang, Wei', 'Wang, Huihan']","['Liu X', 'Shi H', 'Shen J', 'Li Y', 'Yan W', 'Sun Y', 'Liao A', 'Tan Y', 'Yang W', 'Wang H']","[""Haematology Department of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110004, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University Shen Shan Central Hospital, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110004, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110004, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110004, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110004, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110004, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110004, People's Republic of China."", ""Haematology Department of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110004, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial']",20210927,New Zealand,Int J Gen Med,International journal of general medicine,101515487,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAG', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*decitabine', '*elderly', '*rhTPO']",2021/10/07 06:00,2021/10/07 06:01,['2021/10/06 06:52'],"['2021/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/06 06:52 [entrez]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJGM.S323699 [doi]', '323699 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Gen Med. 2021 Sep 27;14:6093-6099. doi: 10.2147/IJGM.S323699. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-6305-1011'],,PMC8485918,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients will not achieve a molecular response and may progress to blast crisis, and the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. In this study, next-generation sequencing was used to explore endogenous miRNAs in CML patients versus healthy volunteers, and miR-342-5p was identified as the primary target. We found that miR-342-5p was downregulated in CML patients and had a significant inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in CML. Through a luciferase reporter system, miR-342-5p was reported to target the 3'-UTR domain of CCND1 and downregulated its expression. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-342-5p enhanced imatinib-induced DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis. Finally, by analyzing clinical databases, we further confirmed that miR-342-5p was associated with predicted molecular responses in CML patients. In conclusion, we found that both in vivo and in vitro experiments and database cohorts showed that miR-342-5p plays a key role in CML patients, indicating that miR-342-5p may be a potential target for future CML treatment or prognostic evaluation.",['(c) 2021.

Additionally, these derivatives can induce apoptosis via mitogen-activated protein kinase and caspase-3 activation, inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptosis. However, vitamin K1 exhibits only weak inhibition of phosphatase activity, while the ability of VK3 to cause oxidative DNA damage has raised concerns about carcinogenicity. Hence, in the current study, we designed, synthesized, and screened a number of VK3 analogs for their ability to enhance phosphorylation activity, without inducing off-target effects, such as DNA damage. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay revealed that each analog produced a different level of cytotoxicity in the Jurkat human leukemia cell line; however, none elicited a cytotoxic effect that differed significantly from that of the control. Of the VK3 analogs, CPD5 exhibited the lowest EC50, and flow cytometry results showed that apoptosis was induced at final concentrations of >/=10 muM; hence, only 0.1, 1, and 10 muM were evaluated in subsequent assays. Furthermore, CPD5 did not cause vitamin K-attributed ROS generation and was found to be associated with a significant increase in caspase 3 expression, indicating that, of the synthesized thioether VK3 analogs, CPD5 was a more potent inducer of apoptosis than VK3. Hence, further elucidation of the apoptosis-inducing effect of CPD5 may reveal its efficacy in other neoplastic cells and its potential as a medication.",,"['Asami, Satoru', 'Suzuki, Mikana', 'Nakayama, Toshimitsu', 'Shimoda, Yasuyo', 'Miura, Motofumi', 'Kato, Koichi', 'Tokuda, Eiichi', 'Ono, Shinichi', 'Kawakubo, Takashi', 'Nishizawa, Kenji', 'Yamanaka, Kenzo', 'Suzuki, Takashi']","['Asami S', 'Suzuki M', 'Nakayama T', 'Shimoda Y', 'Miura M', 'Kato K', 'Tokuda E', 'Ono S', 'Kawakubo T', 'Nishizawa K', 'Yamanaka K', 'Suzuki T']","['Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, 12976Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, 12976Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Toho University Medical Center Omori Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hospital Pharmacy, 38113Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, 539261Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Chemistry, Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, 539261Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, 12976Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, 12976Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, 157437Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Toho University Medical Center Omori Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, 539261Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, 12976Nihon University School of Pharmacy, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211006,United States,Int J Toxicol,International journal of toxicology,9708436,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*lymphocytic leukemia', '*programmed cell death', '*vitamin K3 analogs']",2021/10/07 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2021/10/06 05:29'],"['2021/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/06 05:29 [entrez]']",['10.1177/10915818211047992 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Toxicol. 2021 Dec;40(6):517-529. doi: 10.1177/10915818211047992.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for low lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS BMD Z-score </= -2.0) at diagnosis, as an important indicator for fracture risk and further treatment-related BMD aggravation. Children with ALL (4-18 years), treated according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group protocol (DCOG-ALL9; model development; n = 249) and children from the Canadian Steroid-Associated Osteoporosis in the Pediatric Population cohort (STOPP; validation; n = 99) were included in this study. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to develop the prediction model and to confirm the association of low LS BMD at diagnosis with symptomatic fractures during and shortly after cessation of ALL treatment. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess model performance. The prediction model for low LS BMD at diagnosis using weight (beta = -0.70) and age (beta = -0.10) at diagnosis revealed an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.63-0.78) in DCOG-ALL9 and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.63-0.84) in STOPP, and resulted in correct identification of 71% of the patients with low LS BMD. We confirmed that low LS BMD at diagnosis is associated with LS BMD at treatment cessation (OR 5.9; 95% CI, 3.2-10.9) and with symptomatic fractures (OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4) that occurred between diagnosis and 12 months following treatment cessation. In meta-analysis, LS BMD at diagnosis (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4) and the 6-month cumulative glucocorticoid dose (OR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2) were associated with fractures that occurred in the first year of treatment. In summary, a prediction model for identifying pediatric ALL patients with low LS BMD at diagnosis, as an important indicator for bone fragility, was successfully developed and validated. This can facilitate identification of future bone fragility in individual pediatric ALL patients.

We aimed to develop an immune-related prognostic signature for improving prognosis prediction in DLBCL. Samples from the GSE31312 dataset were randomly allocated to discovery and internal validation cohorts. Univariate Cox, random forest, LASSO regression and multivariate Cox analyses were utilized to develop a prognostic signature, which was verified in the internal validation cohort, entire validation cohort and external validation cohort (GSE10846). The tumor microenvironment was investigated using the CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE tools. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was further applied to analyze the entire GSE31312 cohort. We identified four immune-related genes (CD48, IL1RL, PSDM3, RXFP3) significantly associated with overall survival. Based on discovery and validation cohort analyses, this four-gene signature could classify patients into high- and low-risk groups, with significantly different prognoses. Activated memory CD4 T cells and activated dendritic cells were significantly decreased in the high-risk group, and these patients had lower immune scores. GSEA revealed enrichment of signaling pathways, such as T cell receptor, antigen receptor-mediated, antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I, in the low-risk group.

Here, we describe a new imaging flow cytometry method whereby fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is integrated with cell phenotyping. The method, called ""immuno-flowFISH,"" provides an exciting new dimension for the analysis of genomic changes in cytological samples (e.g., blood, bone marrow). Cells are analyzed in suspension without any requirement for prior cell isolation or separation. Multiple antibodies and FISH probes, each with a unique fluorophore, can be added and many thousands of cells analyzed. Specific cell populations are identified by their antigenic profile and then analyzed for the presence of chromosomal defects. Immuno-flowFISH was applied to the assessment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a mature B-cell neoplasm where chromosomal abnormalities predict prognosis and treatment requirements. This integrated immunophenotyping and multi-probe FISH strategy could detect both structural and numerical chromosomal changes involving chromosomes 12 and 17 in CLL cells. Given that many thousands of cells were analyzed and the leukemic cells were positively identified by their immunophenotype, this multi-probe method adds precision to the cytogenomic analysis of CLL.

Some patients who are IC candidates instead receive ven/aza. We retrospectively analyzed patients with newly diagnosed AML who received ven/aza (n = 143) or IC (n = 149) to compare outcomes, seek variables that could predict response to 1 therapy or the other, and ascertain whether treatment recommendations could be refined. The response rates were 76.9% for ven/aza and 70.5% for IC. The median overall survival (OS) was 884 days for IC compared with 483 days for ven/aza (P = .0020). A propensity-matched cohort was used to compare outcomes in the setting of equivalent baseline variables, and when matched for age, biological risk, and transplantation, the median OS was 705 days for IC compared with not reached for ven/aza (P = .0667). Variables that favored response to ven/aza over IC included older age, secondary AML, and RUNX1 mutations. AML M5 favored response to IC over ven/aza. In the propensity-matched cohort analyzing OS, older age, adverse risk, and RUNX1 mutations favored ven/aza over IC, whereas intermediate risk favored IC over ven/aza. In conclusion, patients receiving IC have improved OS compared with those receiving ven/aza. However, in a propensity-matched cohort of patients with equivalent baseline factors, there was a trend toward favorable OS for ven/aza. Specific variables, such as RUNX1 mutations, reported here for the first time, can be identified that favor ven/aza or IC, helping to guide treatment decisions for patients who may be eligible candidates for either therapy.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

The intestinal bacterial composition also influences treatment-related side effects and even the efficacy of oncological therapies. Acute leukemia (AL) is the most common cancer among children and the most frequent cause of cancer-related death during childhood. Outcomes have improved considerably over the past 4 decades, with the current long-term survival for acute lymphoblastic leukemia being approximately 90%. However, several acute toxicities and long-term sequelae are associated with the multimodal therapy protocols applied in these patients. Specific GM configurations could contribute to the multistep developmental hypothesis for leukemogenesis. Moreover, GM alterations occur during the AL therapeutic course and are associated with treatment-related complications, especially during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The GM perturbation could last even after the removal of microbiome-modifying factors, like antibiotics, chemotherapeutic drugs, or alloimmune reactions, contributing to several health-related issues in AL survivors. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the chronological changes of GM in children with AL, from predisposition to cure. The underpinning biological processes and the potential interventions to modulate the GM toward a potentially health-promoting configuration are also highlighted.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

It is necessary for membrane biogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. In addition to maintaining cell integrity and permeability, increasing evidence indicates a strict link between cholesterol homeostasis, inflammation, and hematological tumors. This makes cholesterol homeostasis an optimal therapeutic target for hematopoietic malignancies. Manipulating cholesterol homeostasis by either interfering with its synthesis or activating the reverse cholesterol transport via the engagement of liver X receptors affects the integrity of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cholesterol homeostasis has also been manipulated to restore antitumor immune responses in preclinical models. These observations have prompted clinical trials involving acute myeloid leukemia to test the combination of chemotherapy with drugs interfering with cholesterol synthesis (ie, statins).

We performed a systematic review to investigate the published literature on efficacy and toxicity of CAR-T therapy in adults with r/r B-ALL. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library for prospective, interventional studies and included published studies of >/=5 patients with median age at enrollment of >/= 18 years. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Institute of Health Economics tool. A total of 2566 records were assessed; 16 studies involving 489 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean CR rate was 81% and MRD negative remission rate was 81% at 4 weeks post CAR-T infusion. With median follow-up across studies of 24 months the cumulative 12-month probability of PFS and OS were 37% (95% CI 26-48%) and 57% (95% CI 49-65%), respectively. Relapse occurred in 40.3%; target antigen was retained in 73.2% of relapses. Across studies, any grade of CRS occurred in 82% (95% CI 61-95%) and grade 3 or higher CRS in 27% (95% CI 18-36%).

Pediatric ALL regimens rely heavily on corticosteroids and asparaginase and are known to increase the risk of osteonecrosis (ON) and fractures in children, particularly adolescents. Orthopedic toxicity among young adults treated on pediatric-inspired regimens is not well described. Here, we report the symptomatic orthopedic toxicities of patients aged 15 to 50 years treated on sequential Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium protocols. Among 367 patients with a median age of 23 years (range, 15-50 years; 68% aged <30 years), 60 patients were diagnosed with ON (5-year cumulative incidence, 17%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13-22), and 40 patients experienced fracture (5-year cumulative incidence, 12%; 95% CI, 8-15). Patients aged <30 years were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with ON (5-year cumulative incidence, 21% vs 8%; P = .004). Patients treated more recently on pegaspargase-based protocols were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with ON compared with those treated on earlier trials with native Escherichia coli asparaginase (5-year cumulative incidence, 24% vs 5%; P < .001). Of the 54 ON events for which adequate information was available, surgery was performed in 25 (46%). Patients with ON had superior overall survival (OS) compared with those without (multivariable OS hazard ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.46; P = .001; ON included as a time-varying exposure). Increased rates of orthopedic toxicity in late-generation protocols may be driven by the pharmacokinetic drug interaction between pegaspargase and dexamethasone, leading to higher dexamethasone exposure.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Here we report a novel mechanism by which lactate/H+ export is sufficient to induce cell growth. Increased lactate/proton export induces intracellular alkalization that selectively activates catalysis by key metabolic gatekeeper enzymes, HK1/PKM2/G6PDH, thereby enhancing glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway carbon flux. The result is increased nucleotide levels, NADPH/NADP+ ratio and cell proliferation. Simply increasing the lactate/proton symporter, MCT4, or sodium-proton antiporter, NHE1 was sufficient to increase intracellular-pH (pHi) and give normal hematopoietic cells a significant competitive growth advantage in vivo. This process does not require additional cytokine triggers and is exploited in malignancy where leukemogenic mutations epigenetically increase MCT4. Inhibiting MCT4 decreased intracellular pH, carbon flux and eliminated acute myeloid leukemia-initiating-cells without cytotoxic chemotherapy. Intracellular alkalization is a primitive mechanism by which proton partitioning can directly reprogram carbon metabolism for cell growth.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Man, Cheuk Him', 'Mercier, Francois Emile', 'Liu, Nian', 'Dong, Wentao', 'Stephanopoulos, Gregory', 'Jiang, Li', 'Jung, Yookyung', 'Lin, Charles', 'Leung, Anskar Yh', 'Scadden, David T']","['Man CH', 'Mercier FE', 'Liu N', 'Dong W', 'Stephanopoulos G', 'Jiang L', 'Jung Y', 'Lin C', 'Leung AY', 'Scadden DT']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, United States.', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Massachussets Institute of Technology, United States.', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Harvard Medical School.', 'Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211005,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/10/06 06:00,2021/10/06 06:00,['2021/10/05 17:23'],"['2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/05 17:23 [entrez]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01704-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011563 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Oct 5. pii: S0006-4971(21)01704-3. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011563.,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5490-4265', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2790-6016', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7450-627X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9821-7133']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term infections in immunocompromised hosts are potential drivers of viral evolution and development of infectious variants. We showed that intrahost evolution in chronic human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) infection in immunocompromised individuals elicited mutations that favored viral entry and persistence, suggesting that similar processes may operate across enveloped respiratory viruses. We profiled longitudinal HPIV3 infections from 2 immunocompromised individuals that persisted for 278 and 98 days. Mutations accrued in the HPIV3 attachment protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), including the first in vivo mutation in HN's receptor binding site responsible for activating the viral fusion process. Fixation of this mutation was associated with exposure to a drug that cleaves host-cell sialic acid moieties. Longitudinal adaptation of HN was associated with features that promote viral entry and persistence in cells, including greater avidity for sialic acid and more active fusion activity in vitro, but not with antibody escape. Long-term infection thus led to mutations promoting viral persistence, suggesting that host-directed therapeutics may support the evolution of viruses that alter their biophysical characteristics to persist in the face of these agents in vivo.",,"['Greninger, Alexander L', 'Rybkina, Ksenia', 'Lin, Michelle J', 'Drew-Bear, Jennifer', 'Marcink, Tara C', 'Shean, Ryan C', 'Makhsous, Negar', 'Boeckh, Michael', 'Harder, Olivia', 'Bovier, Francesca', 'Burstein, Shana R', 'Niewiesk, Stefan', 'Rima, Bert K', 'Porotto, Matteo', 'Moscona, Anne']","['Greninger AL', 'Rybkina K', 'Lin MJ', 'Drew-Bear J', 'Marcink TC', 'Shean RC', 'Makhsous N', 'Boeckh M', 'Harder O', 'Bovier F', 'Burstein SR', 'Niewiesk S', 'Rima BK', 'Porotto M', 'Moscona A']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Host-Pathogen Interaction, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Host-Pathogen Interaction, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Host-Pathogen Interaction, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Host-Pathogen Interaction, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Host-Pathogen Interaction, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', ""Center for Experimental Medicine, Queen's University, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Host-Pathogen Interaction, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Caserta, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Host-Pathogen Interaction, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Influenza', '*Virology']",2021/10/06 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2021/10/05 17:16'],"['2021/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/05 17:16 [entrez]']","['150506 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI150506 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Dec 1;131(23). pii: 150506. doi: 10.1172/JCI150506.,20220110,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']","['Adult', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lung/*virology', 'Lung Diseases/*virology', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/chemistry', 'Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Paramyxoviridae Infections/metabolism/*virology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/therapy/virology', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Internalization', 'Young Adult']",23,,,['R01 AI114736/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC8631596,,,['2022/03/01 00:00'],,,,,,,

At Moffitt Cancer Center, we have moved the administration of high-dose cytarabine and intermediate-dose cytarabine to the outpatient setting through the inpatient/outpatient program. To facilitate outpatient administration, high-dose cytarabine and intermediate-dose cytarabine are given in a shorter interval of every 10 h instead of 12 h. The safety of a shorter duration interval of high-dose cytarabine and intermediate-dose cytarabine is unknown. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of administering high-dose cytarabine and intermediate-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy in the inpatient/outpatient setting. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review to analyze acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with inpatient/outpatient high-dose cytarabine or intermediate-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy at Moffitt Cancer Center from January 1, 2015, through November 1, 2018. The primary objective was to determine the incidence of hospitalization during the inpatient/outpatient administration of high-dose cytarabine or intermediate-dose cytarabine. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three of 255 cycles of high-dose cytarabine/intermediate-dose cytarabine were delivered outpatient over the reviewed time period to 118 patients. No patients receiving outpatient high-dose cytarabine/intermediate-dose cytarabine consolidation required hospitalization during chemotherapy. Our incidence of hospitalization (24%) after chemotherapy is consistent with the reported literature. Through the inpatient/outpatient administration of high-dose cytarabine and intermediate-dose cytarabine, 1265 inpatient days were saved with an approximate revenue of $3,135,176 generated in our study period. CONCLUSION: Inpatient/outpatient administration of high-dose cytarabine and intermediate-dose cytarabine is both safe and feasible. Moving high-dose cytarabine/intermediate-dose cytarabine administration to the outpatient setting resulted in significant additional revenue vs. inpatient administration.",,"['Li, Wenhui', 'Richter, Katherine', 'Lee, Jamie', 'McCarthy, Kevin', 'Kubal, Timothy']","['Li W', 'Richter K', 'Lee J', 'McCarthy K', 'Kubal T']","['158424University of Miami Hospital and Clinics, Miami, FL, USA.', '25301H.

Herein, an adverse effect of NEAT1 is reported, showing that the short isoform, NEAT1_1 suppresses acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development. NEAT1_1 is downregulated in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and its decreased expression correlates with recurrence in AML patients. It is demonstrated that NEAT1_1 suppresses leukemogenesis and LSC function but is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, NEAT1_1 is released from the nucleus into the cytoplasm of AML cells, regulated by transcription factor C/EBPbeta and nuclear protein NAP1L1. Cytoplasmic NEAT1_1 interacts with Wnt component DVL2 and E3 ubiquitin ligase Trim56, facilitates Trim56-mediated DVL2 degradation, and thus suppresses Wnt signaling. Collectively, the findings show NEAT1_1 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and acts as a tumor suppressor in AML.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Despite novel treatment options, the majority of patients are treated with chemotherapy-based regimens. Although widely used, little data exist on the combination of fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (FLAG) and mitoxantrone as salvage strategy for r/r AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients receiving Mito-FLAG for r/r AML treated at a German tertiary care center between 2009 and 2019 were analyzed with regard to response rates, survival and safety profile. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 75.8% with 56.1% of patients achieving complete remission (CR) and 19.7% partial remission (PR). After a median follow-up of 54 months, median overall survival (OS) was 13 months. Patients transitioned to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) (75.8%) showed a significant improvement in OS with a median OS of 17 (95% CI 8.5-25.4) months vs 3 (95% CI 1.7-4.3) months (p < 0.001). 30- and 60-day mortality rates for all patients after the initial cycle of Mito-FLAG were 4.5% and 7.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Mito-FLAG salvage protocol represents an effective and feasible treatment regimen for r/r AML.

Due to these adverse health effects, a sensitive and selective method is crucial for assessing the health impacts of ETS. While current methods to evaluate ETS exposure are either invasive or nonspecific and insensitive, in this study, we assessed the use of polyurethane foam face masks as a sampling medium to collect tobacco smoke-specific nicotine and nitrosamines for estimating personal exposure to ETS. This method was used in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with isotope-dilution detection. After validation by comparison with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health standard method (NIOSH 2551) for nicotine, we quantitated ETS exposure in indoor and outdoor environments. The analysis shows the applicability of the method for monitoring nicotine down to approximately 0.20 mg/m(3) near an outdoor smoking hotspot and up to approximately 5.2 mg/m(3) in a room with burning cigarettes, all with a time resolution as short as 5 min.

This phase 1 study in healthy volunteers assessed the pharmacokinetics of asciminib (40 mg single dose) under 2 conditions: when taken with imatinib (steady state; 400 mg once daily) and a low-fat meal (according to imatinib prescription information), or when taken as single-agent under different food conditions. Asciminib plus imatinib with a low-fat meal increased asciminib area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity and maximum plasma concentration (geometric mean ratios [90% confidence interval], 2.08 [1.93-2.24] and 1.59 [1.45-1.75], respectively) compared with asciminib alone under the same food conditions. Asciminib plus food decreased asciminib area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity compared with asciminib taken under fasted conditions (geometric mean ratios: low-fat meal, 0.7 [0.631-0.776]; high-fat meal, 0.377 [0.341-0.417]). Asciminib plus imatinib was well tolerated with no new safety signals. Overall, coadministration of asciminib with imatinib and a low-fat meal results in a moderate increase in asciminib exposure compared with asciminib alone under the same food condition. Food itself decreases asciminib exposure, indicating that single-agent asciminib should be administered in the fasted state to prevent potential suboptimal exposures.","['(c) 2021, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.']","['Hoch, Matthias', 'Zack, Julia', 'Quinlan, Michelle', 'Huth, Felix', 'Forte, Sofia', 'Dodd, Stephanie', 'Aimone, Paola', 'Hourcade-Potelleret, Florence']","['Hoch M', 'Zack J', 'Quinlan M', 'Huth F', 'Forte S', 'Dodd S', 'Aimone P', 'Hourcade-Potelleret F']","['Novartis Pharma AG, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, New Jersey, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, New Jersey, USA.', 'Novartis Pharma AG, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Pharma AG, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211005,United States,Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev,Clinical pharmacology in drug development,101572899,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 inhibitor', 'asciminib', 'asciminib plus imatinib combination therapy', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'food effect', 'imatinib']",2021/10/06 06:00,2021/10/06 06:00,['2021/10/05 08:58'],"['2021/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/05 08:58 [entrez]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cpdd.1019 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev. 2021 Oct 5. doi: 10.1002/cpdd.1019.,,,,,,,['Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation'],,,,,,,,,,,

Current status and new perspectives.,e00778,10.1002/prp2.778 [doi],"Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and its incidence and mortality are rapidly increasing worldwide. The dynamic interaction of immune cells and tumor cells determines the clinical outcome of cancer. Immunotherapy comes to the forefront of cancer treatments, resulting in impressive and durable responses but only in a fraction of patients. Thus, understanding the characteristics and profiles of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a necessary step to move forward in the design of new immunomodulatory strategies that can boost the immune system to fight cancer. Histamine produces a complex and fine-tuned regulation of the phenotype and functions of the different immune cells, participating in multiple regulatory responses of the innate and adaptive immunity. Considering the important actions of histamine-producing immune cells in the TME, in this review we first address the most important immunomodulatory roles of histamine and histamine receptors in the context of cancer development and progression. In addition, this review highlights the current progress and foundational developments in the field of cancer immunotherapy in combination with histamine and pharmacological compounds targeting histamine receptors.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the functions of SPNS3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. This study obtained SPNS3 from a gene set that was related to AML relapse and evaluate whether high SPNS3 expression induced apoptosis resistance in an AML cell line, which is consistent with the role of SPNS3 as a marker of poor prognosis in the clinic. Moreover, internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) mutation and the AC127521.1/ MIR-139/SPNS3 competing endogenous RNA axis were found to regulate SPNS3 expression. In addition, we noted that SPNS3 may play an important role in the Sphingosine-1-phosphate signal pathway that is involved in the maintenance of the AML microenvironment.

Total (bound + unbound) and unbound imatinib plasma concentrations obtained from 134 patients with COVID-19 participating in the CounterCovid study and from an historical dataset of 20 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and 85 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were compared. Total imatinib area under the concentration time curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax ) and trough concentration (Ctrough ) were 2.32-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-3.29), 2.31-fold (95% CI 1.33-3.29), and 2.32-fold (95% CI 1.11-3.53) lower, respectively, for patients with CML/GIST compared with patients with COVID-19, whereas unbound concentrations were comparable among groups. Inclusion of alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations measured in patients with COVID-19 into a previously published model developed to predict free imatinib concentrations in patients with GIST using total imatinib and plasma AAG concentration measurements (AAG-PK-Model) gave an estimated mean (SD) prediction error (PE) of -20% (31%) for total and -7.0% (56%) for unbound concentrations. Further covariate modeling with this combined dataset showed that in addition to AAG; age, bodyweight, albumin, CRP, and intensive care unit admission were predictive of total imatinib oral clearance. In conclusion, high total and unaltered unbound concentrations of imatinib in COVID-19 compared to CML/GIST were a result of variability in acute phase proteins. This is a textbook example of how failure to take into account differences in plasma protein binding and the unbound fraction when interpreting PK of highly protein bound drugs, such as imatinib, could lead to selection of a dose with suboptimal efficacy in patients with COVID-19.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Treatment is not curative and often involves repeated relapses and retreatments. Illness perceptions - cognitive and emotional representations of illness stimuli - were studied in CLL patients to: 1) identify illness perception 'profiles' prior to treatment; and 2) test whether profile membership predicts psychological responses 12 months later as treatment continued. DESIGN: CLL patients (N = 259), randomized to one of four cancer treatment trials testing targeted therapy, were assessed before starting treatment and at 12 months. METHODS: The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) assessed perceived consequences, timeline, personal/treatment control, identity, comprehension, concern, and emotions toward CLL. Psychological outcomes were depressive symptoms (PHQ-9/BDI-II), negative mood (POMS), and cancer stress (IES-R). Latent profile analysis (LPA) determined number of profiles and differential BIPQ items for each profile. Multilevel models tested profiles as predictors of 12-month psychological outcomes. RESULTS: LPA selected the three-profile model, with profiles revealing Low (n = 150; 57.9%), Moderate (n = 21; 8.1%), and High-impact (n = 88; 34.0%) illness representations. Profiles were defined by differences in consequences, identity, concern, and emotions. Profile membership predicted all psychological outcomes (ps<.038). Low-impact profile patients endorsed minimal psychological symptoms; High-impact profile patients reported substantial symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the first CLL illness representation study provide directions for future clinical efforts. By identifying differences among patients' perceptions of CLL consequences, symptom burden, concerns, and emotional responses, an at-risk patient group might receive tailored psychological treatment. Treatments may address negative perceptions, to reduce psychological risk associated with chronic cancer.",['(c) 2021 British Psychological Society.'],"['Arrato, Nicole A', 'Valentine, Thomas R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Maddocks, Kami J', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Andersen, Barbara L']","['Arrato NA', 'Valentine TR', 'Byrd JC', 'Jones JA', 'Maddocks KJ', 'Woyach JA', 'Andersen BL']","['Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211004,England,Br J Health Psychol,British journal of health psychology,9605409,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'depression', 'illness perceptions', 'latent profile analysis', 'stress']",2021/10/06 06:00,2021/10/06 06:00,['2021/10/05 06:56'],"['2021/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/05 06:56 [entrez]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjhp.12562 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Br J Health Psychol. 2021 Oct 4. doi: 10.1111/bjhp.12562.,,,,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6825-1074'],"['Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Solove Research Institute', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', 'D.

Establishing the diagnosis and distinguishing blastoid-HGBL from B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in bone marrow can be challenging. We assessed 31 cases of blastoid-HGBL diagnosed initially in bone marrow and compared this group to 36 cases of B-ALL using immunophenotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and targeted next generation sequencing analysis. The 31 blastoid-HGBL cases included 14 HGBL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (double hit lymphoma, DHL), 13 HGBL, not otherwise specified (NOS), and four cases with TdT expression that were difficult to classify. Compared with B-ALL, blastoid-HGBL cases more often showed increased intensity/bright expression of CD20, CD38, CD45, BCL-6, and MYC, and less frequent bright expression of CD10 and TdT. Cases of blastoid-HGBL also more frequently had MYC rearrangement, a complex karyotype and TP53 mutation (p < 0.01). With the exception of CD34, no other single factor, including TdT, was sensitive or adequately specific to distinguish blastoid-HGBL from B-ALL. We developed a scoring system using six distinctive features between 16 cases of unequivocal blastoid HGBL and 22 cases of CD34-positive B-ALL, with a score of >/=3 defining blastoid-HGBL. The system was further validated by using 15 cases of surface light chain negative, and/or CD45 dim to negative blastoid-HGBL and 14 cases of CD34-negative B-ALL. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value of this scoring system were 100%, 94%, 94%, and 100%, respectively. Using this system, the four cases with TdT expression were all classified as blastoid-HGBL: three were DHL and one was HGBL-NOS. In conclusion, blastoid-HGBL shows distinctive immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features as compared with B-ALL. The proposed scoring system can be helpful for the classification of diagnostically challenging blastoid lymphoid tumors presenting initially in the bone marrow.","['(c) 2021.

Most marrow metabolites were detected in plasma (N = 661; 81%), and we observed moderate-to-strong correlations (median rs 0.62, interquartile range [IQR] 0.29-0.83). We detected 328 CSF metabolites in plasma (90%); plasma-CSF correlations were weaker (median rs 0.37, IQR 0.07-0.70). We observed plasma-marrow correlations for metabolites in pathways associated with end-induction residual disease (pyruvate, asparagine) and plasma-CSF correlations for a biomarker of fatigue (gamma-glutamylglutamine).

Eighty-six percent received one, 14% two induction cycles, and 10% received consolidation (representing 22% of patients with CR/CRi) with CPX-351.

Oncogenic kinases Akt, S6K, and PKC, and pro-apoptotic kinase Mst1, have been recognized as functional targets of the PHLPP family. However, we observed that, in T-leukemia cells subjected to metabolic stress from glucose limitation, PHLPP2 specifically targets the energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase, pAMPK, rather than Akt or S6K. PHLPP2 dephosphorylates pAMPK in several other human cancer cells as well. PHLPP2 and pAMPK interact with each other, and the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain on PHLPP2 is required for their interaction, for dephosphorylating and inactivating AMPK, and for the apoptotic response of the leukemia cells to glucose limitation. Silencing PHLPP2 protein expression prolongs the survival of leukemia cells subjected to severe glucose limitation by promoting a switch to AMPK-mediated fatty acid oxidation for energy generation. Thus, this study reveals a novel role for PHLPP2 in suppressing a survival response mediated through AMPK signaling. Given the multiple ways in which PHLPP phosphatases act to oppose survival signaling in cancers and the pivotal role played by AMPK in redox homeostasis via glucose and fatty acid metabolism, the revelation that AMPK is a target of PHLPP2 could lead to better therapeutics directed both at cancer and at metabolic diseases.",['(c) 2021.

The design and construction of the target molecule were carried out starting from the guanidinium nitrate salt (previously synthesized) and the corresponding enaminone. X-ray diffraction analysis and a study of the Hirshfeld surfaces revealed important interactions between the nitro-group O atoms and the H atoms of the pyridine and pyrimidine rings. A crystalline ordering in layers, by the stacking of rings through interactions of the pi-pi type, was observed and confirmed by a study of the shape-index surfaces and dispersion energy calculations. Quantitative electrostatic potential studies revealed the most positive value of the molecule on regions close to the N-H groups (34.8 kcal mol(-1)); nevertheless, steric impediments and the planarity of the molecule do not allow the formation of hydrogen bonds from this group. This interaction is however activated when the molecule takes on a new extended conformation in the active pocket of the enzyme kinase (PDB ID 2hyy), interacting with protein residues that are fundamental in the inhibition process of CML. The most negative values of the molecule are seen in regions close to the nitro group (-35.4 and -34.0 kcal mol(-1)). A molecular docking study revealed an energy affinity of DeltaG = -10.3 kcal mol(-1) for NPPA which, despite not having a more negative value than the control molecule (Imatinib; DeltaG = -12.8 kcal mol(-1)), shows great potential to be used as a template for new drugs against CML.",,"['Moreno-Fuquen, Rodolfo', 'Arango-Daravina, Kevin', 'Kennedy, Alan R']","['Moreno-Fuquen R', 'Arango-Daravina K', 'Kennedy AR']","['Grupo de Cristalografia, Departamento de Quimica, Universidad del Valle, AA 25360, Santiago de Cali, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Cristalografia, Departamento de Quimica, Universidad del Valle, AA 25360, Santiago de Cali, Colombia.', 'WestCHEM, Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde, 295 Cathedral Street, Glasgow G1XL, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210923,England,Acta Crystallogr C Struct Chem,"Acta crystallographica.

Recent research has focused on targeted therapy to improve responses and limit potential toxicity. AREAS COVERED: CD123 (also known as IL-3 Ralpha) is a cell surface marker and attractive therapeutic target for many myeloid malignancies, particularly BPDCN, whose cells ubiquitously overexpress CD123. We review the history of CD123 research regarding BPDCN, recent advances including FDA approval of tagraxofusp (formerly SL-401) for BPDCN, and ongoing clinical studies utilizing novel therapeutic strategies to target CD123. EXPERT OPINION: The approval of tagraxofusp for the treatment of BPDCN in December 2018 drastically changed the treatment landscape for patients with this rare neoplasm. While tagraxofusp is better tolerated than traditional multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, it requires close monitoring and sound clinical judgment by providers to prevent and mitigate severe treatment-related complications with special attention to the recognition and management of capillary leak syndrome (CLS). Several other promising strategies for targeting CD123 in BPDCN are currently under investigation, including antibody-drug conjugates, T-cell engagers, and CAR-T cellular therapeutics. These CD123 targeted approaches may soon become standard of care for patients with this difficult to treat malignancy.",,"['DiPippo, Adam J', 'Wilson, Nathaniel R', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen']","['DiPippo AJ', 'Wilson NR', 'Pemmaraju N']","['Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, Pharmacy Clinical Programs, The University of Texas Md Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,Texas US.', 'Resident Physician, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, US.', 'Associate Professor, Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, US.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211029,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BPDCN', 'CD123', 'IL-3ralpha', 'SL-401', 'Ucart123', 'Xmab14045', 'imgn632', 'tagraxofusp']",2021/10/06 06:00,2021/10/06 06:00,['2021/10/05 05:31'],"['2021/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/05 05:31 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2021.1988848 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2021 Nov;14(11):993-1004. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2021.1988848.

Rituximab concurrent with cladribine (CDAR) improves response rates, but long-term outcomes are unknown. We report final results of a phase 2 study of CDAR for patients with HCLv. Twenty patients with 0 to 1 prior courses of cladribine and/or rituximab, including 8 who were previously untreated, received cladribine 0.15 mg/kg on days 1 to 5 with 8 weekly rituximab doses of 375 mg/m2 beginning day 1. Patients received a second rituximab course >/=6 months after cladribine, if and when minimal residual disease (MRD) was detected in blood. The complete remission (CR) rate from CDAR was 95% (95% confidence interval, 75-100). Sixteen (80%) of 20 patients (95% confidence interval, 56-94) became MRD negative according to bone marrow at 6 months. The median duration of MRD-negative CR was 70.1 months, and 7 of 16 are still MRD negative up to 120 months. With a median follow-up of 69.7 months, 11 patients received delayed rituximab, and the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 63.3% and 73.9%, respectively. Five patients with TP53 mutations had shorter PFS (median, 36.4 months vs unreached; P = .0024) and OS (median, 52.4 months vs unreached; P = .032). MRD-negative CR at 6 months was significantly associated with longer PFS (unreached vs 17.4 months; P < .0001) and OS (unreached vs 38.2 months; P < .0001). Lack of MRD in blood at 6 months was also predictive of longer PFS and OS (P < .0001). After progression following CDAR, median OS was 29.7 months. CDAR is effective in HCLv, with better outcomes in patients who achieve MRD-negative CR.

In preclinical studies, type 1 interferon (IFN-alpha) enhanced cross-presentation of leukemia-specific antigens by CD8alpha dendritic cells (DCs) and amplified GVL. This observation was translated into a proof-of-concept phase 1/2 clinical trial with long-acting IFN-alpha (pegylated IFN-alpha [pegIFNalpha]) in patients undergoing HCT for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with treatment-resistant AML not in remission or those with poor-risk leukemia were administered 4 dosages of pegIFNalpha every 14 days beginning at day -1 before HCT. Dose selection was established by adaptive design that continuously assessed the probability of dose-limiting toxicities throughout the trial. Efficacy was evaluated by determining the 6-month incidence of relapse at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Thirty-six patients (median age, 60 years) received pegIFNalpha treatment. Grade 3 or greater severe adverse events occurred in 25% of patients, establishing 180 mug as the MTD. In phase 2, the incidence of relapse was 39% at 6 months, which was sustained through 1-year post-HCT. The incidence of transplant-related mortality was 13%, and severe grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 11%. Paired blood samples from donors and recipients after HCT revealed elevated levels of type 1 IFN with cellular response, the persistence of cross-presenting DCs, and circulating leukemia antigen-specific T cells. These data suggest that prophylactic administration of pegIFNalpha is feasible in the peri-HCT period. In high-risk AML, increased toxicity was not observed with preliminary evidence for reduction in leukemia relapse after HCT.

There are no previously published data on the influence of donor rs1049174 polymorphism on HLA-haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy-haplo). We aimed to investigate the effect of donor NKG2D gene polymorphism on PTCy-haplo recipients. We retrospectively reviewed 91 consecutive PTCy-haplo recipients at our institution, and genotyped rs1049174 of the NKG2D gene in both donors and patients. In the patients who received PTCy without antithymocyte globulin (ATG) as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse/progression (RI) of PTCy-haplo from rs1049174 CC donors was lower than that from rs1049174 CG/GG donors (25.0% versus 52.4%; P=.041), and rs1049174 CC donors were associated with a decreased risk of relapse/progression (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 0.6; P=.007). Furthermore, a beneficial effect of rs1049174 CC donor on OS and RI was observed in non-acute myelogenous leukemia patients. This study demonstrates that receipt of PTCy-haplo from rs1049174 CC donors was associated with a decreased risk of relapse/progression in the patients who underwent PTCy-haplo without ATG. Future large-scale validation studies are needed to test the significance of donor NKG2D polymorphism in the development of a new donor selection algorithm for PTCy-haplo.

The reaction provided straightforward and practical access to a series of novel aryl-labdane-type derivatives (HM adducts 3a-h) in moderate to good yields in a highly regio- and stereoselective manner at room temperature under air atmosphere. The cytotoxic activity of these compounds was investigated in vitro against three different human cell lines (THP-1, K562, MCF-7). Of these, HM adduct 3h showed a selective effect in all cancer cell lines tested and was selected for extended biological investigations in a leukemia cell line (K562), which demonstrated that the cytotoxic/antiproliferative activity observed in this compound might be mediated by induction of cell cycle arrest at the sub-G1 phase and by autophagy-induced cell death.

Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies of ALL and AML, which provide new insights into the cellular ecosystem of acute leukemia and point to future clinical utility, are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss current challenges that need to be overcome for a more wide-spread adoption of RNA-sequencing in clinical diagnostics and how this technology significantly can aid the identification of genetic alterations in current guidelines and of newly emerging disease entities, some of which are critical to identify because of the availability of targeted therapies, thereby paving the way for improved precision medicine of acute leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

It may occur at any segment involved by ischemia, chronic inflammation, or necrosis. It is typically associated with a preliminary renal lesion that may arise as a result of interventional procedures, inflammatory conditions, colon tumor, and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, among others. CASE REPORT: 15-year-old female patient diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia admitted at our institution for baseline condition management. During her stay, she experienced gastrointestinal and urinary infectious events. In the assessment and management of those, a left colorenal fistula was found. Surgical treatment was decided upon. DISCUSSION: Colorenal fistula typically occurs secondary to renal inflammation or infection.

We sought to examine the impact of this change in practice on patient outcomes. We analyzed the outcomes of 483 patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between August 2017 and August 2020, at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Canada, in the retrospective study, comparing the outcomes between those who received cryopreserved or fresh peripheral blood stem cell grafts. Overall compared with those who received fresh grafts (n = 348), patients who received cryopreserved grafts (n = 135) had reduced survival and GRFS, reduced incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), delay in neutrophil engraftment, and higher graft failure (GF), with no significant difference in relapse incidence or acute GvHD. However, recipients of cryopreserved matched-related donor HSCT showed significantly worse OS, NRM, GRFS compared with fresh grafts. Multivariable analysis of the entire cohort showed significant impact of cryopreservation on OS, relapse, cGvHD, GF, and GRFS. We conclude that cryopreservation was associated with inferior outcomes post-HSCT, possibly due to the combination of ATG and post-transplant cyclophosphamide impacting differential tolerance to cryopreservation on components of the stem cell graft; further studies are warranted to elucidate mechanisms for this observation.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Ibrutinib has an established favorable toxicity profile with up to 8 years of experience in clinical trials; however, despite ibrutinib's favorable toxicity profile, dose reductions and treatment discontinuations are becoming more evident in clinical practice, particularly in the setting of specific clinical contexts and patient characteristics. This manuscript is set to provide practical recommendations on the management of patients treated with this agent in daily practice. METHODS: A group of multidisciplinary experts from Portugal met to discuss and highlight practical recommendations, supported on both literature and clinical insights, for the management of the treatment with ibrutinib. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Handling of both toxicities and drug-drug interactions during ibrutinib treatment poses several challenges to healthcare providers and can benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. The involvement of specialties, such as cardiology, infectiology and pharmacology, can bring an added value to patient care, not only in anticipating/managing safety issues and dose adjustments but also in enhancing adherence to treatment, ultimately improving the risk/benefit balance. CONCLUSION: By involving a multidisciplinary group of experts, this work provides a set of key recommendations to optimize care and outcomes for ibrutinib-treated patients. Despite not being a fully comprehensive review on the topic, it is intended as a framework to hematologists and other healthcare professionals who manage these patients in their daily clinical practice.",,"['Carda, Jose Pedro', 'Santos, Lurdes', 'Mariz, Jose Mario', 'Monteiro, Pedro', 'Goncalves, Humberto Miguel', 'Raposo, Joao', 'Gomes da Silva, Maria']","['Carda JP', 'Santos L', 'Mariz JM', 'Monteiro P', 'Goncalves HM', 'Raposo J', 'Gomes da Silva M']","['Servico de Hematologia Clinica, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR), Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Sao Joao, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Nephrology and Infectious Diseases R&D, I3S - Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Onco-Haematology Clinic, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, EPE/IPOFG - CRO, Porto, Portugal.', 'Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Servico Farmaceutico, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa, Francisco Gentil, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte, EPE, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa, Francisco Gentil, EPE, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancies', 'Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'ibrutinib', 'recommendations']",2021/10/05 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/10/04 08:44'],"['2021/10/04 08:44 [entrez]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1980690 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):785-798. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1980690.,20211028,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']","['Adenine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Patient Care', 'Piperidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Portugal/epidemiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8198-9812', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0622-6823', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0240-4749', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6631-207X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6993-2450']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still necessary to elucidate the profile of drug-related problems in pediatric cancer treatment to contribute to guide clinical pharmacy activities. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. Records on Excel(R) spreadsheets of 2 years of pharmaceutical assistance were analyzed regarding the prescriptions of chemotherapy for hospitalized patients aged 0-19 years. Data on age, sex, cancer diagnosis, protocol and drugs prescribed were collected. Causes and types of DRPs and pharmacists' interventions as their rate of acceptance were measured according to PCNE V 9.0. RESULTS: Drug-related problems were identified for 84 patients, in 5.3% of analyzed prescriptions. Leukemias, patients aged 0-4 years and male sex were associated with higher rates of drug-related problems. The BFM 2009 protocol for acute lymphocytic leukemia treatment had the highest frequency of prescriptions with drug-related problems. Main drug-related problems were related to effectiveness (49.2%) and safety (33.2%), with most of them due to drug selection and dose. Rate of acceptance of interventions was 92.2% and 90.6% of drug-related problems were fully resolved. Mercaptopurine and filgrastim were the drugs most associated with drug-related problems. Oral antineoplastic agents represented 36% of the prescriptions with drug-related problems. CONCLUSION: The high rate of acceptance of pharmacist interventions demonstrates the relevance of the pharmacist participation in the care of hospitalized pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy. Pharmacists need to take attention to cases of necessity of drug prescription, intervening with other health professionals. Special attention to oral chemotherapy is required.",,"['Agnol, Rafaela Dall', 'Dos Santos, Maite T', 'Michalowski, Mariana B', 'Einsfeld, Lidia']","['Agnol RD', 'Dos Santos MT', 'Michalowski MB', 'Einsfeld L']","['Pharmacy Service, Clinical Pharmacy Section, 37895Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Child and Adolescent Health, 28124Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and Pediatric Oncology Service, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Pharmacy Service, Clinical Pharmacy Section, 37895Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211004,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical pharmacist', 'antineoplastic chemotherapy protocol', 'drug-related problems', 'oncology', 'pediatric']",2021/10/05 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2021/10/04 08:41'],"['2021/10/04 08:41 [entrez]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211041037 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Oct 4:10781552211041037. doi: 10.1177/10781552211041037.,,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3889-7656', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4013-4233', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9482-0776', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5222-233X']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Manufacturing of therapy-competent functional CAR-T cells needs robust protocols for ex vivo/in vitro expansion of modified T-cells. This step is challenging, especially if non-viral low-efficiency delivery protocols are used to generate CAR-T cells. Modern protocols for CAR-T cell expansion are imperfect since non-specific stimulation results in rapid outgrowth of CAR-negative T cells, and removal of feeder cells from mixed cultures necessitates additional purification steps. To develop a specific and improved protocol for CAR-T cell expansion, cell-derived membrane vesicles are taken advantage of, and the simple structural demands of the CAR-antigen interaction. This novel approach is to make antigenic microcytospheres from common cell lines stably expressing surface-bound CAR antigens, and then use them for stimulation and expansion of CAR-T cells. The data presented in this article clearly demonstrate that this protocol produced antigen-specific vesicles with the capacity to induce stronger stimulation, proliferation, and functional activity of CAR-T cells than is possible with existing protocols. It is predicted that this new methodology will significantly advance the ability to obtain improved populations of functional CAR-T cells for therapy.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, their application and effectiveness are limited because of toxicity and resistance as well as a lack of knowledge of molecular mechanisms downstream of microtubule inhibition. Insights into key pathways that link microtubule disruption to cell death is critical for optimal use of these drugs, for defining biomarkers useful in patient stratification, and for informed design of drug combinations. Although MTAs characteristically induce death in mitosis, microtubule destabilizing agents such as vincristine also induce death directly in G1 phase in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Because many signaling pathways regulating cell survival and death involve changes in protein expression and phosphorylation, we undertook a comprehensive quantitative proteomic study of G1 phase ALL cells treated with vincristine. The results revealed distinct alterations associated with c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling, anti-proliferative signaling, the DNA damage response, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Signals specifically associated with cell death were identified by pre-treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which caused G1 arrest and precluded death induction. These results provide insights into signaling mechanisms regulating cellular responses to microtubule inhibition and provide a foundation for a better understanding of the clinical mechanisms of MTAs and for the design of novel drug combinations.

Literature on adherence to oral anticancer therapy in India is very less. Materials and Methods This is a cross sectional analytical study consisting of all fit patients > 18 years of age taking oral anticancer therapy, with or without intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. Adherence was determined using Morisky-Green-Levine (MGL) scale, and factors affecting adherence details about cancer and treatment were obtained. All fit patients were recruited. Information was obtained using Tamil questionnaire and pro forma. Observation Of 152 patients, only 111 patients were found to be adherent to treatment. The mean age of the study population was 49.03 +/- 13.48 years. Only 12.5% of patients were aware of the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. The study population consisted mainly of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, colorectal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and stomach carcinoma, which amounted for 78.3% of the study population. Bivariate analysis concluded that duration of treatment, adverse drug reaction (ADR), duration of oral anticancer drug intake in a month, coadministration with IV anticancer drugs, and frequency of drug intake (anticancer drug) were significant factors affecting drug adherence. Multivariate analysis of the above variables was insignificant, but ADR tended toward significance. Conclusion Drug adherence plays a major role in treatment outcome in cancer patients. ADR was independently associated with decreased drug adherence. Key interventions which should include counseling and behavioral modifications will reduce nonadherence.","['MedIntel Services Pvt Ltd.

This review examines the relationship between the gut microbiome and CTX as well as the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome. A literature search was conducted in electronic databases Medline, PubMed and ScienceDirect, with searches for ""cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"" and ""microbiome/microbiota"". The relevant literature was selected for use in this article. Seventeen studies were selected on participants with colorectal cancer (CRC; n=5), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML; n=3), Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=2), breast cancer (BCa; n=1), lung cancer (n=1), ovarian cancer (n=1), liver cancer (n=1), and various other types of cancers (n=3). Seven studies assessed the relationship between the gut microbiome and CTX with faecal samples collected prior to (n=3) and following CTX (n=4) showing that the gut microbiome is associated with both CTX efficacy and toxicity. Ten other prospective studies assessed the impact of CTX during treatment and found that CTX modulates the gut microbiome of people with cancer and that dysbiosis induced by the CTX is related to AEs.

Materials and Methods: The study was carried out with peripheral blood lymphocytes probed for the AURKA and TP53 genes using the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method (Vysis, USA and Kreatech, The Netherlands). The control group included 70 people: clinically healthy donors and patients with non-oncological diseases such as gastritis, pancreatitis, chronic calculous cholecystitis, bronchial asthma, peptic ulcer disease, inguinal hernia, arthrosis, myoma, hepatitis, epilepsy, chronic prostatitis, chronic tonsillitis, and rectal adenoma. The group of cancer patients included 219 people with various oncological diseases: gastric cancer (n=68), colorectal cancer (n=30), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=52), Hodgkin lymphoma (n=33), and polyneoplasia (n=41). Results: In the control group, the mean frequency of lymphocytes with asynchronous gene replication (AGR) was 22.0+/-3.4% for AURKA and 18.0+/-3.2% for TP53; in the group of cancer patients, that was 36.8+/-4.8 and 28.4+/-5.1%, respectively. The excessive presence of lymphocytes with the AGR in cancer patients was consistent and statistically significant (p<0.0001). For the AURKA gene, the AGR-based cancer detection showed a sensitivity of 98.6+/-0.7%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 98.3+/-0.8%, and for the TP53 gene - 78.6+/-3.1, 98.5+/-0.9, and 85.9+/-2.6%, respectively. Conclusion: This pilot study on lymphocytes with AGR of AURKA and TP53 genes in cancer patients can serve a basis for creating a new molecular cytogenetic technology for detecting malignant neoplasms in humans.",,"['Tsepenko, V V', 'Shkavrova, T G', 'Cherkesov, V N', 'Golub, E V', 'Mikhailova, G F']","['Tsepenko VV', 'Shkavrova TG', 'Cherkesov VN', 'Golub EV', 'Mikhailova GF']","['Senior Researcher, Laboratory of Molecular and Genetic Pathology, Department of Clinical Morphology; A.

The patient, who was in remission with regard to the underlying hematological disease, developed edema of both optic discs and maculas three months after transplantation. The morphological finding regressed after treatment with corticoids and comprehensive systemic anti-infective therapy. However, the loss of function was not entirely restored. CASE REPORT: One year after the healing, the atrophy of the optic discs persisted, with corresponding findings in vessel density (VD), retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and visual field changes. Electrophysiological examination by pattern electroretinogram (PERG) showed an alteration in retinal ganglion cells in the left eye, but with significant damage to nerve fibres on both sides. Visual evoked potential (VEP) verified bilateral non-inflammatory neurogenic lesions. This finding was also confirmed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Examination by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed inflammatory changes in the optic nerve sheaths over time and a consequent marked narrowing of them. CONCLUSION: The authors believe that edema of the optic discs and maculas was caused by a combination of several factors. Firstly, MRI showed inflammatory changes in the optic nerve sheaths, which led to a blockade of axoplasmic transport. Another factor that may have played a part in the outcome was endothelial damage to blood vessels with impaired microcirculation supplying the optic nerve fibres, which contributed to the occurrence of macular edema.",,"['Lestak, Jan', 'Mlcak, Petr', 'Kuba, Adam', 'Maresova, Klara', 'Kyncl, Martin', 'Tintera, Jaroslav', 'Fus, Martin']","['Lestak J', 'Mlcak P', 'Kuba A', 'Maresova K', 'Kyncl M', 'Tintera J', 'Fus M']","['JL Opthalmology Clinic, Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'JL Opthalmology Clinic, Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic.', 'JL Opthalmology Clinic, Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic.', 'JL Opthalmology Clinic, Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210930,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,IM,,,2021/10/05 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2021/10/04 05:48'],"['2021/10/04 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2021.056 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2021 Sep 30. doi: 10.5507/bp.2021.056.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with FLT3 or IDH1/2 inhibitors is used for such patients; however, it is not considered for most patients with AML who lack mutations on the respective genes. In this study, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) was found to serve as a new therapeutic target in various AMLs with or without FLT3 mutations. BI-D1870, a potent inhibitor of RSK, significantly suppressed the proliferation of AML cell lines, among which three encoded wild-type FLT3 and three contained FLT3 driver mutations, compared with chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells or other adherent cancer cells. BI-D1870 inhibited protein synthesis by dephosphorylating the p70 S6 kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 in all AML cells except KG-1a cells. Meanwhile, the expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B-I and -II increased in KG-1a cells treated with BI-D1870. BI-D1870 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in all AML cells, including KG-1a cells. We next investigated the synergistic effect of BI-D1870 with cytarabine, a traditional anticancer drug used in AML. Synergistic effects of BI-D1870 and cytarabine were not observed in any of the cell lines. The findings suggested that BI-D1870 alone exerts an adequate antiproliferative effect on AML with or without FLT3 mutations and serves as a novel AML therapeutic agent.",,"['Katayama, Kazuhiro', 'Nishihata, Ayane']","['Katayama K', 'Nishihata A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Targeted Therapeutics, School of Pharmacy, Nihon University.', 'Division of Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University.', 'Division of Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211001,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BI-D1870', 'Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)', 'protein synthesis']",2021/10/05 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/04 05:42'],"['2021/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/04 05:42 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.b21-00531 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2021 Dec 1;44(12):1843-1850. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b21-00531.

HL-60 and U-937 cells were used to assess the antileukaemia effect of leonurine in vitro, and HL-60 and U-937 xenograft nude mice were used to evaluate its antitumour effect in vivo. Leonurine inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 and U-937 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, leonurine therapy prevented the growth of tumours in both xenograft animal models. Leonurine could induce apoptosis in HL-60 and U-937 cells. The cytotoxic effects of leonurine on HL-60 and U-937 cells were associated with an increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9, and increased expression of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm. Leonurine inhibited activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in HL-60 and U-937 cells by lowering the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and Akt.

To investigate the mechanisms of miR-494-3p on endometrial receptivity, GnRHa's superovulation scheme was designed to reduce endometrial receptivity, and the pregnant mice were injected with miR-494-3p antagomir. The regulatory role of miR-494-3p was identified by RT-qPCR, uterine blastocyst count, scanning electron microscopy, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and Western blot. Results indicated that miR-494-3p antagomir increased uterine blastocysts numbers, promoted the pinocytosis expressions, and increased endometrial thickness. Besides, miR-494-3p antagomir significantly increased leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Ang-2 and VEGF protein expressions, and up-regulated p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR protein ratios in endometrium. Luciferase assay confirmed that LIF was a potential target of miR-494-3p. Subsequently, human endometrial epithelial cells (hEECs) were transfected with miR-494-3p inhibitor and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). The role of miR-494-3p was identified by RT-qPCR, CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. Results indicated that miR-494-3p inhibitor significantly increased proliferation and invasion, and significantly inhibited apoptosis in hEECs, while LY294002 reversed its biological function. Overall, these results suggested that miR-494-3p is the key regulator of endometrial receptivity in mice, regulating this complex process through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Understanding the role of miR-494-3p in endometrial receptivity is of great significance for exploring new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of early pregnancy failure, and improving the success rates of artificial reproduction.",,"['Yuan, Lan', 'Feng, Fen', 'Mao, Zhu', 'Huang, Jin-Zhu', 'Liu, Yi', 'Li, Yu-Lin', 'Jiang, Rong-Xing']","['Yuan L', 'Feng F', 'Mao Z', 'Huang JZ', 'Liu Y', 'Li YL', 'Jiang RX']","['School of Medical and Life Sciences/Reproductive and Women-Children Hospital, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.

As an oncoprotein as well as a potential immunomodulator, SHP2 has now emerged as an attractive target for novel anti-cancer agents. Although significant progress has been made in identifying chemotypes of SHP2 inhibitors, these specific compounds might not be clinically useful to inhibit frequently encountered mutated SHP2 variants. Consequently, it is highly desirable to develop chemically different SHP2 inhibitors sensitive to SHP2 mutants. This work developed a new type of SHP2 inhibitors with 2,5-diaryl-1,3,4-oxadiazole scaffold. The representative compound 6l exhibited SHP2 inhibitory activity with IC50 of 2.73 +/- 0.20 microM, showed about 1.56-fold, 5.26-fold, and 7.36-fold selectivity for SHP2 over SHP1, PTP1B and TCPTP respectively. Further investigations confirmed that 6l behaved as mixed-type inhibitor sensitive to leukemia cell TF-1 and inhibited SHP2 mediated cell signaling and proliferation. Molecular dynamics simulation provided more detailed information on the binding modes of compounds and SHP2 protein.

The normal expression of five leukemia-associated genes (SPAG6, ST18, MSLN, PRAME, XAGE1A) was defined in children without hematologic disease (n = 53) and children with suspected infection (n = 90). Gene expression at AML diagnosis (n=50) and during follow-up (n = 21) was compared with child-specific reference values. At diagnosis, 34/50 children (68%) had high expression of at least one of the five genes, and so did 16/31 children (52%) without a leukemia-specific target. Gene expression was quantified in 110 peripheral blood (PB) samples (median, five samples/patient; range, 1 to 10) during follow-up in 21 patients with high expression at diagnosis. All nine patients with PB sampling performed within 100 days of disease recurrence displayed overexpression of SPAG6, ST18, PRAME, or XAGE1A at a median of 2 months (range, 0.6 to 9.6 months) before hematologic relapse, whereas MSLN did not reach expression above normal prior to hematologic relapse. Only 1 of 130 (0.8%) follow-up analyses performed in 10 patients in continuous complete remission had transient expression above normal. SPAG6, ST18, PRAME, and XAGE1A expression in PB may predict relapse in childhood AML patients and facilitate MRD monitoring in most patients without a leukemia-specific target.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

Certain of actions of RA are mediated by RA nuclear receptors that regulate gene expression. However, it is also known that direct protein modification by RA (retinoylation) can occur. One such retinoylated protein in HL60 cells is a regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), which is increased in the nucleus following RA treatment and which then increases phosphorylation of other nuclear proteins. However, a complete understanding of which nuclear proteins are phosphorylated is lacking. In the current study, we employed mass spectrometry to identify one of the PKA-phosphorylated proteins as a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SF2, SRSF1). We found that RA treatment increased the level of PKA-phosphorylated SF2 but decreased the level of SF2. While SF2 regulates myelogenous cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1, anti-apoptotic factor), RA treatment reduced the level of Mcl-1L (full-length Mcl-1 long) and increased the level of Mcl-1S (Mcl-1 short; a short splicing variant of the Mcl-1). Furthermore, treatment with a PKA inhibitor reversed these effects on Mcl-1 and inhibited RA-induced cell differentiation. In contrast, treatment with a Mcl-1L inhibitor enhanced RA-induced cell differentiation. These results indicate that RA activates PKA in the nucleus, increases phosphorylation of SF2, raises levels of Mcl-1S and lowers levels of Mcl-1L, resulting in the induction of differentiation. RA-modified PKA may play an important role in inducing cell differentiation and suppressing cell proliferation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It is associated with the feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), and owing to the poor prognosis, treatment is rarely reported. A 4-year-old female Korean domestic shorthair cat was presented with hyporexia, fever, lethargy, severe anaemia and rubricytosis. An FeLV antigen test was positive, but a subsequent polymerase chain reaction test was negative. Serum biochemistry analysis results were normal, except for slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with acute erythroleukaemia, and single high-dose (600 mg/m(2) ) cytarabine chemotherapy was administered via constant rate infusion for 12 h a day for 5 days. After the first cytarabine administration, the clinical signs and anaemia improved, though no change was noted to other haematological parameters. The patient died of shock 16 days after the second cytarabine administration; the total survival time after diagnosis was 67 days. Post-mortem cytological evaluation of bone marrow aspiration revealed that the myeloid/erythroid ratio was 0.49, the erythroid progenitor cells were 64% of all nucleated cells and the blast cells were 84% of the non-erythroid cells. Histopathology images indicated that the spleen was diffusely expanded by atypical round cells, possibly erythroid precursors. This is the first case report on the prognosis and effects of high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy for acute feline erythroleukaemia with FeLV infection. Although the clinical signs improved, the treatment was not effective. Further studies on erythroleukaemia chemotherapy protocols are required.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Physicians are now faced with several equally effective therapy options when treating patients with CLL. Here, we review the role of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors in treating patients with treatment-naive and relapsed or refractory CLL. We review recent approvals of BTK inhibitors as well as reported and ongoing clinical trial data. RECENT FINDINGS: The approval of ibrutinib rapidly led to a paradigm shift in the management of CLL. Randomized trials have now compared ibrutinib to several chemoimmunotherapy approaches, which were in favor of ibrutinib. Second-generation more selective BTK inhibitors, including acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, have been developed, and recent data have led to the approval of acalabrutinib in CLL. Ongoing and future studies focus on either combining BTK inhibitors with other novel agents (e.g., venetoclax, obinutuzumab, or ublituximab) or developing next-generation non-covalent reversible BTK inhibitors that may be effective in treating patients with CLL harboring BTK-resistant mutations. The field of CLL continues to evolve rapidly with new and evolving combination treatments and novel BTK agents, which will continue to change the standard of care for CLL.","['(c) 2021.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed 120 childhood cancer survivors aged 8-18 years from the pediatric oncology center in South Korea between March and August 2017. The modified Exercise & Quality of Life questionnaire, Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, and Godin Leisure-Time Questionnaire were used to assess PA levels, preferences, and exercise barriers. RESULTS: Among 120 participants (72 boys, 48 girls) whose average age at the time of the survey was 14.57 +/- 3.00 years and the average age at diagnosis was 8.22 years, the three most common diagnoses were acute leukemia (43.3%), brain tumor (13.3%), and malignant lymphoma (10.8%). Only 16 participants (5%) met the PA recommendations for children (at least 60 min of moderate PA per day). The most preferred sporting activities included soccer, basketball, strengthening exercises, badminton, dance, and taekwondo. They generally had positive attitudes toward exercise, and more than 63% of participants intended to exercise the following month. The five most prevalent perceived barriers to exercise were lack of time, poor health, reluctance to sweat, lack of exercise skills, and no exercise partners. CONCLUSIONS: While most childhood cancer survivors did not meet the PA recommendation, most of them agreed that exercise was beneficial, and they intended to participate in the exercise. Exercise and PA programs should be tailored to the personal health and preferences of childhood cancer survivors.","['(c) 2021.

Whether similar disparities exist among AYA with aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is unknown. We identified all Ontario, Canada AYA aged 15-21 years at diagnosis of B-NHL between 1992 and 2012. Demographic, disease, treatment and outcome data were chart abstracted. The impact of LOC on event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined, adjusted for patient and disease covariates. Among 176 AYA with B-NHL, 62 (35.2%) received therapy at paediatric centres. The 5-year EFS and OS [+/- standard error (SE)] for the overall cohort were 72.2 [3.4]% and 76.1 [3.2]% respectively. Both EFS and OS were superior among paediatric centre AYA [EFS (+/- SE) 82.2 (4.9)% vs. 66.7 (4.4)%, P = 0.02; OS 85.5 (4.5)% vs. 71.1 (4.3)%, P = 0.03]. Adjusted for histology, stage and time period, adult centre AYA had inferior EFS [hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.9, P = 0.02] and OS (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.7, P = 0.03). Sensitivity analyses restricted to the latest time period, when most adult centre AYA received rituximab, demonstrated similar disparities.

Imatinib was the first drug that could effectively treat this condition, but its use is hindered by the development of mutations of the BCR-ABL protein, which are the cause of resistance. Therefore, dasatinib and afatinib present similarities that can be explored to discover new molecules capable of overcoming the effects of imatinib. Afatinib exhibited electronic and docking behavior, indicating that a replacement with some minor modifications could design a new potential inhibitor. The amide group in each candidate is clearly of pharmacophoric importance, and it needs to concentrate a negative region. Sulfur group presents a good pharmacophoric profile, which was shown by dasatinib results, adding to the influence of the Met318 residue in the target protein active site configuration. This behavior suggests that the sulfur atom and other fragments that have an affinity for the methionine sidechain may provide a significant positive effect when present in TKI molecules such as afatinib or dasatinib.","['(c) 2021.

While imatinib seems to have no adverse impact on outcomes after transplant, little is known on the effects of prior use of second-generation TKI (2GTKI). We present the results of a prospective non-interventional study performed by the EBMT on 383 consecutive CML patients previously treated with dasatinib or nilotinib undergoing allo-HCT from 2009 to 2013. The median age was 45 years (18-68). Disease status at transplant was CP1 in 139 patients (38%), AP or >CP1 in 163 (45%), and BC in 59 (16%). The choice of 2GTKI was: 40% dasatinib, 17% nilotinib, and 43% a sequential treatment of dasatinib and nilotinib with or without bosutinib/ponatinib. With a median follow-up of 37 months (1-77), 8% of patients developed either primary or secondary graft failure, 34% acute and 60% chronic GvHD. There were no differences in post-transplant complications between the three different 2GTKI subgroups. Non-relapse mortality was 18% and 24% at 12 months and at 5 years, respectively. Relapse incidence was 36%, overall survival 56% and relapse-free survival 40% at 5 years. No differences in post-transplant outcomes were found between the three different 2GTKI subgroups.

The role of Brahma (BRM), a chromatin remodeler, in HSC function is unknown. Bone marrow (BM) from Brm(-/-) mice manifested increased numbers of long- and short-term HSCs, GMPs, and increased numbers and cycling of functional HPCs. However, increased Brm(-/-) BM HSC numbers had decreased secondary and tertiary engraftment, suggesting BRM enhances HSC self-renewal. Valine was elevated in lineage negative Brm(-/-) BM cells, linking intracellular valine with Brm expression. Valine enhanced HPC colony formation, replating of human cord blood (CB) HPC-derived colonies, mouse BM and human CB HPC survival in vitro, and ex vivo expansion of normal mouse BM HSCs and HPCs. Valine increased oxygen consumption rates of WT cells. BRM through CD98 was linked to regulated import of branched chain amino acids, such as valine, in HPCs. Brm(-/-) LSK cells exhibited upregulated interferon response/cell cycle gene programs. Effects of BRM depletion are less apparent on isolated HSCs compared to HSCs in the presence of HPCs, suggesting cell extrinsic effects on HSCs. Thus, intracellular valine is regulated by BRM expression in HPCs, and the BRM/valine axis regulates HSC and HPC self-renewal, proliferation, and possibly differentiation fate decisions.","['(c) 2021.

We report a highly dynamic proteome in terms of both protein abundance and subcellular localisation, with alterations in the interferon response, endo-lysosomal system, plasma membrane reorganisation and cell migration. Proteins not previously associated with an LPS response were found to relocalise upon stimulation, the functional consequences of which are still unclear. By quantifying proteome-wide uncertainty through Bayesian modelling, a necessary role for protein relocalisation and the importance of taking a holistic overview of the LPS-driven immune response has been revealed. The data are showcased as an interactive application freely available for the scientific community.",['(c) 2021.

However, the excess burden added by AF to the morbidity and mortality of CLL patients especially in the hospitalized setting is undetermined. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was accessed to gather data of hospitalized CLL patients with AF from 2009 to 2018. Propensity-score matching (PSM) and logistic regression model were performed to control for baseline patient factors to match 7265 CLL patient admissions with AF and 7265 CLL patient admissions without AF. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality (ACM), while the secondary outcomes included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and the need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), acute heart failure (AHF), acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF), cardiac arrest (CA), cardiogenic shock (CS), stroke, and the total cost of hospitalization. RESULTS: CLL patients with AF had a higher rate of ACM (6.06% vs 4.47%; odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.61; P =< .001). All other secondary outcomes including ACS, AMI, PCI, AHRF, CA, CS, and stroke were observed at a significantly higher rate in the AF group as well. The median total hospital cost was also higher in the AF group ($9097 vs. $7646; P value < .0001) CONCLUSION: CLL patients with AF are at a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiac-related mortality, and stroke. For this population, a multidisciplinary approach should be orchestrated for better management and outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

To determine the utility of pathologic analysis of routine, nonsuspicious pediatric tonsil specimens, we investigated the incidence of hematologic and lymphoid malignancy diagnosed at the time of or following T +/- A. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients 0-18 years undergoing T +/- A between 2012 and 2020 with or without pathologic analysis. RESULTS: Included were 14,141 patients who underwent routine T +/- A (mean age 11 +/- 4.6 years, 48% female). Of these, tonsils of 2464 patients were sent to pathology, where zero were found to harbor malignancy. Seven patients (0.050%) developed malignancy after T +/- A. Of these, 4 had unremarkable tonsils per pathology, and 3 did not have tonsils analyzed. There were 5 cases of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL, 0.035%), 1 case of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (0.007%), and 1 case of Lymphoma (0.007%). The average length of time from T +/- A to diagnosis was 2.4 +/- 1.8 years. CONCLUSION: No cases of occult malignancy were identified in specimens from routine T +/- A with pathologic analysis, even among patients who later developed malignancy. This study suggests that sending routine pediatric T +/- A specimens for formal pathologic analysis is an inefficient use of resources without appreciably improving the quality and safety of patient care.",['Published by Elsevier B.V.'],"['Tholen, Kaitlyn', 'Kalmanson, Olivia', 'Francom, Christian R', 'Prager, Jeremy D']","['Tholen K', 'Kalmanson O', 'Francom CR', 'Prager JD']","[""Department of Otolaryngology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, USA; Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA."", 'Department of Otolaryngology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, USA.

In order to restore fertility in these patients, ex vivo purging of ovarian fragments could be proposed as a strategy to eradicate malignant cells before grafting. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a clinical-approved modality, is a minimally invasive and selective therapeutic for eliminating malignant cells. The present work aims therefore to evaluate the phototoxicity of two photosensitizers (aluminum phthalocyanine (AlPc) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)) on leukemia cells. To this end, two lines of malignant cells (K562 and HL-60) and isolated ovarian stromal cells (control) were treated by PDT using a diode laser with various energy densities. Cell viability after the treatment, the amount of generated reactive oxygen species, dark toxicity of the photosensitizers, and single-cell morphology were studied. Our results demonstrated that using irradiation with the energy density of 10 J/cm(2), 1 microM AlPc could significantly reduce the viability of K562 (4.73 +/- 0.14%) and HL-60 (2.74 +/- 0.31%). Similarly, the viability of these cells was reduced (K562 cells: 3.84 +/- 0.81%; HL-60 cells: 6.82 +/- 3.21%) with 1 microM ZnPc and an energy density of 50 J/cm(2). On the other hand, these PDT protocols had no significant effect on stromal cells. These findings indicate that our approach can be a promising strategy for the safe restoration of fertility in leukemia patients. However, further studies are necessary to assess its efficiency in ovarian fragments containing malignant cells to determine their eradication rate and the effect of our treatment on the survival of stromal cells and preantral follicles.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: In this study, we performed a genomic analysis of diagnosis-relapse pairs of 12 children who relapsed very early, followed by a deep-sequencing validation of all identified mutations. In addition, we included one case with a good initial treatment response and on-treatment relapse at the end of upfront therapy. RESULTS: We observed a dynamic clonal evolution in all cases, with relapse almost exclusively originating from a subclone at diagnosis. We identified several driver mutations that may have influenced the outgrowth of a minor clone at diagnosis to become the major clone at relapse. For example, a minimal residual disease (MRD)-based standard-risk patient with ETV6-RUNX1-positive leukemia developed a relapse from a TP53-mutated subclone after loss of the wildtype allele. Furthermore, two patients with TCF3-PBX1-positive leukemia that developed a very early relapse carried E1099K WHSC1 mutations at diagnosis, a hotspot mutation that was recurrently encountered in other very early TCF3-PBX1-positive leukemia relapses as well. In addition to alterations in known relapse drivers, we found two cases with truncating mutations in the cohesin gene RAD21. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive genomic characterization of diagnosis-relapse pairs shows that very early relapses in BCP-ALL frequently arise from minor subclones at diagnosis.

Patient-level data from two pivotal trials, ELIANA (tisagenlecleucel; n = 79) and MT103-205 (blinatumomab; n = 70), were used in comparisons of CR and OS, controlling for cross-trial difference in available patient characteristics. Five different adjustment approaches were implemented: stabilized inverse probability of treatment weight (sIPTW); trimmed sIPTW; stratification by propensity score quintiles; adjustment for prognostic factors; and adjustment for both prognostic factors and propensity score. Comparative analyses indicate that treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with a statistically significant higher likelihood of achieving CR and lower hazard of death than treatment with blinatumomab. The tisagenlecleucel group exhibited a higher likelihood of CR than the blinatumomab group in every analysis regardless of adjustment approach (odds ratios: 6.71-9.76). Tisagenlecleucel was also associated with a lower hazard of death than blinatumomab in every analysis, ranging from 68% to 74% lower hazard of death than with blinatumomab, determined using multiple adjustment approaches (hazard ratios: 0.26-0.32). These findings support the growing body of clinical trials and real-world evidence demonstrating that tisagenlecleucel is an important treatment option for children and young adults with R/R ALL.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

This retrospective study summarized data from 11 consecutive Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) clinical trials for patients with newly diagnosed AML. In all, 3240 patients with AML were analyzed, and 36 (1.11%) were found to have CNS involvement at diagnosis. The incidence of CNS disease among the 5 studies with per protocol mandatory lumbar puncture (LP) was similar to the incidence among studies in which LP was performed at the discretion of the investigator (0.86% vs 1.41%; P = .18). There was no significant difference in the rate of complete remission (CR) among patients with CNS involvement and those with other extramedullary disease (EMD) sites or those with no EMD (52.8% vs 59.3%-60%). The median overall survival (OS) for patients who were CNS positive, who had other EMD, or who had no EMD was 11.4, 11.3, and 12.7 months, respectively. There was no difference in OS among patients with CNS involvement, those with other EMD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; adjusted P = .84), and those with no EMD (HR, 1.19; adjusted P = .44). In conclusion, the reported incidence of CNS involvement in patients with newly diagnosed AML is low (1.1%), irrespective of whether an LP is mandatory or not. The presence of CNS disease at diagnosis in and of itself does not seem to portend a poor prognosis for achieving an initial CR or for OS.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Standard nonintensive therapies have low response rates and only extend life by a few months. Quizartinib is an oral Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor with reported activity in wild-type patients. As part of the AML LI trial, we undertook a randomized evaluation of low-dose ara-C (LDAC) with or without quizartinib in patients not fit for intensive chemotherapy. Overall, survival was not improved (202 patients), but in the 27 FLT3-ITD patients, the addition of quizartinib to LDAC improved response (P = .05) with complete remission/complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery for quizartinib + LDAC in 5/13 (38%) vs 0/14 (0%) in patients receiving LDAC alone. Overall survival (OS) in these FLT3-ITD+ patients was also significantly improved at 2 years for quizartinib + LDAC (hazard ratio 0.36; 95% confidence intervals: 0.16, 0.85, P = .04). Median OS was 13.7 months compared with 4.2 months with LDAC alone. This is the first report of an FLT3-targeted therapy added to standard nonintensive chemotherapy that has improved survival in this population. Quizartinib merits consideration for future triplet-based treatment approaches.

Much remains uncovered on how MLL-r AML drives leukemia development while preventing cells from normal myeloid differentiation. Here, we identified that transcription factor MEF2D is a super-enhancer-associated, highly expressed gene in MLL-r AML. Knockout of MEF2D profoundly impaired leukemia growth, induced myeloid differentiation, and delayed oncogenic progression in vivo. Mechanistically, MEF2D loss led to robust activation of a CEBPE-centered myeloid differentiation program in AML cells. Chromatin profiling revealed that MEF2D binds to and suppresses the chromatin accessibility of CEBPE cis-regulatory regions. In human acute leukemia samples, MEF2D expression showed a strong negative correlation with the expression of CEBPE. Depletion of CEBPE partially rescued the cell growth defect and myeloid cell differentiation induced by the loss of MEF2D. Lastly, we show that MEF2D is positively regulated by HOXA9, and downregulation of MEF2D is an important mechanism for DOT1L inhibitor-induced antileukemia effects. Collectively, our findings suggest that MEF2D plays a critical role in human MLL-r AML and uncover the MEF2D-CEBPE axis as a crucial transcriptional mechanism regulating leukemia cell self-renewal and differentiation block.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

The risk of cancer in children with these diseases is poorly understood and has never been assessed in a population-based cohort before. METHODS: We identified 421 patients with FA and 160 patients with AT diagnosed between 1973 and 2020 through German DNA repair disorder reference laboratories. We linked patients' laboratory data with childhood cancer data from the German Childhood Cancer Registry. RESULTS: Among 421 patients with FA, we observed 33 cases of childhood cancer (15 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome; seven cases of acute myeloid leukemia; two cases of lymphoma, carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and nephroblastoma, respectively; and one case of rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and glioma, respectively) versus 0.74 expected (on the basis of population-based incidence rates in Germany). This corresponds to a 39-fold increased risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 39; 95% CI, 26 to 56). For all FA subgroups combined, the cancer-specific SIR for myeloid neoplasms was 445 (95% CI, 272 to 687). Among the 160 patients with AT, we observed 19 cases of childhood cancer (15 cases of lymphoma, three cases of leukemia, and one case of medulloblastoma) versus 0.32 expected.

We hypothesized that intensifying induction on the AAML1031 clinical trial would improve outcomes compared to the predecessor trial AAML0531. METHODS: Patients on AAML0531 received cytarabine (1600 mg/m(2) )/daunorubicin (150 mg/m(2) )/etoposide (ADE) for induction II and patients on AAML1031 received mitoxantrone (48 mg/m(2) )/cytarabine (8000 mg/m(2) ) (MA). Stem cell transplant (SCT) conditioning included busulfan/cyclophosphamide on AAML0531, whereas AAML1031 used busulfan/fludarabine and liberalized donor eligibility. Patients were included in this analysis if they met high-risk criteria common to the two trials by cytogenics or poor disease response after induction I ADE. RESULTS: MA provided no benefit over ADE at: induction II response (complete response [CR]: 64% vs. 62%, p = .87; measurable residual disease [MRD]+: 57% vs. 46%, p = .34); or intensification I response (CR: 79% vs. 94%, p = .27; MRD+: 27% vs. 20%, p = 1.0). When considered with altered SCT approach, MA did not improve 5-year disease-free survival (24% +/- 9% vs. 18% +/- 15%, p = .63) or 5-year overall survival (35% +/- 10% vs. 38% +/- 18%, p = .66). MA was associated with slower neutrophil recovery (median 34 vs. 27 days, p = .007) and platelet recovery (median 29 vs. 24.5 days, p = .04) and longer hospital stay (32 vs. 28 days, p = .01) during induction II. CONCLUSION: Intensification of induction II did not improve treatment response or survival, but did increase toxicity and resource utilization. Alternative strategies are urgently needed to improve outcomes for pediatric patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT01371981, NCT00372593).",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Elgarten, Caitlin W', 'Wood, Andrew C', 'Li, Yimei', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Brodersen, Lisa Eidenschink', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Getz, Kelly D', 'Huang, Y-S Vera', 'Loken, Michael', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Pollard, Jessica A', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Woods, William G', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Elgarten CW', 'Wood AC', 'Li Y', 'Alonzo TA', 'Brodersen LE', 'Gerbing RB', 'Getz KD', 'Huang YV', 'Loken M', 'Meshinchi S', 'Pollard JA', 'Sung L', 'Woods WG', 'Kolb EA', 'Gamis AS', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Hematologics, Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California, USA."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Department of Biomedical Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Hematologics, Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University/Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.', ""Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211001,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"[""Children's Oncology Group"", 'acute leukemia', 'induction', 'mitoxantrone', 'myeloid leukemia', 'pediatric oncology']",2021/10/02 06:00,2021/10/02 06:00,['2021/10/01 12:37'],"['2021/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/01 12:37 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29281 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec;68(12):e29281. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29281.

However, in acute phase of blast crisis, 80% patients show resistance, 40% among them despite inhibition of Bcr-Abl1 activity. This implies activation of either Bcr-Abl1- independent signalling pathways or restoration of signalling downstream of inactive Bcr-Abl1. In the present study, mass spectrometry and subsequent in silico pathway analysis of differentiators in resistant CML-CP cells identified key differentiators, 14-3-3epsilon and p38 MAPK, which belong to Bcr-Abl1 pathway. Their levels and activity respectively, indicated active Bcr-Abl1 pathway in CML-BC resistant cells, though Bcr-Abl1 is inhibited by imatinib. Further, contribution of these components to resistance was demonstrated by inhibition of Bcr-Abl1 down-stream signalling by knocking-out of 14-3-3epsilon and inhibition of p38 MAPK activity.

We define financial uncertainty (FU) as the difference between an actual amount of claim (AC) and the discounted present value of the AC (DAC). DAC can be calculated based on a discounted present value calculated using a cash flow, a period of investment, and a discount rate. The present study considered these three items as AC, the length of hospital stay, and the predicted mortality rate. The mortality prediction model was built using typical data items in standard level electronic medical records such as sex, age, and disease information. The performance of the prediction model was moderate because an area under curve was approximately 85%. The empirical analysis primarily compares the FU of the top 20 diseases with the actual AC using a retrospective cohort in the University of Miyazaki Hospital. The observational period is 5 years, from April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2018. The analysis demonstrates that the proportion of FU to actual AC is higher than 20% in low-weight children, patients with leukemia, brain tumor, myeloid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. For these diseases, patients cannot avoid long hospitalization; therefore, the medical fee payment system should be designed based on uncertainty. Our method is both practical and generalizable because it uses a small number of data items that are required in standard electronic medical records. This method contributes to the decision-making processes of health policymakers.","['(c) 2021.

We sought to evaluate perioperative factors associated with early CRBSIs in newly diagnosed pediatric cancer patients, particularly hematologic indices and antibiotic use. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed national registry records of newly diagnosed pediatric cancer patients with port-a-caths inserted using standardized perioperative protocols where only antibiotic use was not regulated. Thirty-day postoperative CRBSI incidence was correlated with preoperative factors using logistic regression and with postoperative blood counts using linear trend analysis. RESULTS: Among 243 patients, 17 CRBSIs (7.0%) occurred at median 14 (range, 8-28) postoperative days. Early CRBSIs were significantly associated with cancer type [acute myeloid leukemia and other leukemias (AML/OLs) vs. solid tumors and lymphomas (STLs): odds ratio (OR), 5.09; P = 0.0036; acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs. STL: OR 0.83; P = 0.0446] but not preoperative antibiotics, absolute neutrophil counts and white blood cell counts. Thirty-day postoperative absolute neutrophil counts and white blood cell trends differed significantly between patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and STLs (OR 0.83, P < 0.05) and between AML/OLs and STLs (OR 5.09, P < 0.005), with AML/OL patients having the most protracted neutropenia during this period. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to common belief, low preoperative absolute neutrophil counts and lack of preoperative antibiotics were not associated with higher early CRBSI rates. Instead, AML/OL patients, particularly those with prolonged neutropenia during the first 30 postoperative days, were at increased risk. Our findings do not support the use of empirical preoperative antibiotics and instead identify prolonged postoperative neutropenia as a major contributing factor for early CRBSI.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Despite this, ALL survivors remain at increased risk for long-term cognitive impairments. AIM: To identify demographic and treatment factors associated with school performance in pediatric survivors of ALL. METHODS: We collected standardized test scores for reading, math, and science obtained in a school setting from grades 3-11 in 63 ALL survivors (46.0% boys). Most participants were assessed across multiple grades (median number of grades n = 5, range 1-7), and 269 observations were considered in the analyses. Treatment exposures were extracted from medical records. Socio-economic status was estimated using participation in free/reduced lunch programs at school. Mixed effects linear regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with school performance. RESULTS: ALL survivors' scores were comparable to state norms on reading, math, and science performances. On multivariable analysis, participation in free/reduced lunch programs was significantly associated with lower reading scores (beta = -12.52; 95% CI -22.26:-2.77, p = .01). Exposure to radiation during treatment was also associated with lower reading test scores (beta = -30.81, 95% CI -52.00:-9.62, p = .01). No significant associations between demographics and treatment parameters were observed for math and science test scores. CONCLUSIONS: We utilized population-based achievement tests conducted from grades 3-11 to characterize school performance in ALL survivors.

A critical reappraisal of recently developed prognostic models is presented in this review. The underlying CLL's genetic instability and changes in the host's health and comorbidities can all contribute to the acquisition of additional risk factors for adverse outcomes during the course of the disease. Therefore, available risk models solely based on pretreatment variables only partially predict patients' clinical outcome. A dynamic prognostic model that takes into account changes in the risk profile over time could indeed be useful in routine clinical practice. The next generation of risk assessment models should incorporate post-treatment and response biomarkers such as minimal residual disease. Finally, recent advances in the field of machine learning present novel opportunities to generate models capable of providing an individualized estimation of clinical outcomes in CLL. However, in the era of improved prognostic models, it is important to remember that these indices should supplement but not replace clinical expertise and medical decision-making.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Molica, Stefano', 'Seymour, John F', 'Polliack, Aaron']","['Molica S', 'Seymour JF', 'Polliack A']","['Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah - Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20211001,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'dynamic prognostic models', 'machine learning', 'post-treatment biomarkers', 'prognostic models', 'systematic review']",2021/10/02 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/01 08:51'],"['2021/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/01 08:51 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2929 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Dec;39(5):595-604. doi: 10.1002/hon.2929.

TNBC cells lack targetable receptors; hence, there is an urgent need for targetable markers for the disease. Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) are a fraction of cells in primary tumors that are associated with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy. Targeting BCSCs is thus an effective strategy for preventing cancer metastatic spread and sensitizing tumors to chemotherapy. The CD44(hi) CD24(lo) phenotype is a well-established phenotype for identification of BCSCs, but CD44 and CD24 are not targetable markers owing to their expression in normal tissues. The ganglioside GD2 has been shown to be upregulated in primary TNBC tumors compared with normal breast tissue and has been shown to identify BCSCs. In this review, we discuss GD2 as a BCSC- and tumor-specific marker in TNBC; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the signaling pathways that are upstream and downstream of GD2 and the role of these pathways in tumorigenesis and metastasis in TNBC; direct and indirect approaches for targeting GD2; and ongoing clinical trials and treatments directed against GD2 as well as future directions for these strategies.",['(c) 2021 New York Academy of Sciences.'],"['Shao, Claire', 'Anand, Vivek', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Battula, Venkata Lokesh']","['Shao C', 'Anand V', 'Andreeff M', 'Battula VL']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211001,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC', 'GD2', 'GD3 synthase', 'breast cancer stem cells', 'dinutuximab', 'immunotherapy', 'mTOR signaling', 'triple-negative breast cancer']",2021/10/02 06:00,2021/10/02 06:00,['2021/10/01 08:50'],"['2021/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/01 08:50 [entrez]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/nyas.14700 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2021 Oct 1. doi: 10.1111/nyas.14700.,,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1144-1958', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5415-9058']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mortality, premature mortality, cause-eliminated life expectancy, potential years of life lost (PYLL), average potential years of life lost (APYLL), annual change percentage (APC), and other indicators of cancer were calculated. The age-standardized rates were calculated using the sixth national census (2010).From 2013 to 2018, the mortality rate of cancer in Feicheng City was 221.55/100,000, and the standardized mortality rate was 166.37/100,000. The standardized mortality rate increased from 2013 to 2014 and then decreased annually. The premature mortality of cancer was 8.98% and showed a downward trend (APC = -2.47%, t = -3.10, P = .04). From 2013 to 2018, the average life expectancy of residents in Feicheng City was 78.63 years. Eliminating the impact of cancer, life expectancy could increase by 3.72 years. The rate of life loss caused by cancer in men was higher than that in women. The total life loss caused by cancer deaths was 126,870.50 person-years, the potential life loss rate was 22.51 per thousand, and the average potential life loss was 13.30 years. The standardized potential years of life lost rate showed a downward trend (APC = -2.96%, t = -3.72, P = .02), and APYLL decreased by 1.98% annually (t = -5.44, P = .01). The top 5 malignant tumors in APYLL were leukemia, breast cancer, brain tumor, liver cancer, and ovarian cancer.Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, female breast cancer, and childhood leukemia have a great impact on the life expectancy of residents in Feicheng City. Effective measures need to be taken to reduce the disease burden of malignant tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

OBJECTIVE: To assess treatment utilization patterns of newly initiated oral anticancer agents across national samples of Medicare beneficiaries for 5 cancer types: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), and metastatic breast cancer (mBC). METHODS: This retrospective claims analysis used 100% Medicare Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) Parts A, B, and D files from 2011 to 2014 (for CML, MM, mPC, and mRCC patients) and a 5% random fee-for-service sample from 2011 to 2013 (for mBC patients). Outcomes of interest were the number of 30-day supply prescriptions, adherence, and discontinuation of newly initiated (ie, index) oral anticancer agents indicated for each of the cancers. Adherence was calculated with both the ""traditional"" proportion of days covered (PDC) approach, measured over a fixed 1-year period or until hospice/death, and a ""modified"" PDC approach, measured over the time between the first and last fill of the index oral anticancer agent. Patients with PDC of at least 0.80 were deemed as being adherent. Discontinuation was defined as the presence of a continuous 90-day gap in the availability of days supply of the index oral anticancer agent. RESULTS: Our study included 1,650, 7,461, 6,998, 2,553, and 79 patients for CML, MM, mPC, mRCC, and mBC, respectively. Patients with mRCC had the highest proportion of patients with only 1 fill of their index anticancer agent (28%) followed by mBC (17%), MM (17%), mPC (12%), and CML (12%). Patients with CML had the highest mean (SD) number of 30-day supply equivalent prescriptions (8.3 [4.6]), followed by patients with mPC (6.5 [4.2]), MM (5.7 [4.1]), mBC (4.7 [3.2]), and mRCC (4.5 [3.9]). Using the modified PDC measured between the first and last fills, approximately three-quarters of patients with CML (74%), mRCC (71%), and mBC (70%) were adherent to the index oral anticancer agent. Adherence was highest for patients with mPC (87%) and lowest for patients with MM (58%). The percentage of patients defined as adherent to the index oral anticancer agent decreased for all cancers when using the traditional PDC measure over a fixed 1-year period: CML (54%), MM (35%), mPC (48%), mRCC (37%), and mBC (22%). Rates of discontinuation for patients in our sample were 32% (CML), 38% (mPC), 42% (mRCC), 48% (MM), and 58% (mBC). CONCLUSIONS: Between 13% and 42% of Medicare patients were nonadherent between the first and last fill of their newly initiated oral anticancer therapies across a range of cancers. This study provides a valuable benchmark for stakeholders seeking to measure and improve adherence to oral anticancer agents in Medicare patients.

Gilteritinib is the first targeted therapy approved in the United States and Europe for R/R FLT3(mut+) AML with significantly improved efficacy compared with existing treatments. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate gilteritinib against salvage chemotherapy (SC) and best supportive care (BSC) over a lifetime horizon among adult patients with R/R FLT3(mut+) AML from a US third-party payer's perspective. METHODS: The model structure of this cost-effectiveness analysis included a decision tree to stratify patients based on their hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) status, followed by 2 separate 3-state partitioned survival models to predict the long-term health status conditional on HSCT status. The ADMIRAL trial data and literature were used to predict probabilities of patients being in different health states until a conservative cure point at year 3. Afterwards, living patients followed the survival outcomes of long-term survivors with AML. Model inputs for utilities, medical resource use, and costs were based on the ADMIRAL trial, published literature, and public sources. All costs were inflated to 2019 US dollars (USD). Total incremental costs (in 2019 USD), life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Deterministic sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon with a 3.0% annual discount rate, the base-case model estimated that gilteritinib led to an increase of 1.29 discounted QALYs at an additional cost of $148,106 vs SC, corresponding to an ICER of $115,192 per QALY; for BSC, results were an increase of 2.32 discounted QALYs, $249,674, and $107,435, respectively. The base-case findings were robust in sensitivity analyses. The estimated probabilities of gilteritinib being cost-effective vs SC and BSC were 90.5% and 99.8%, respectively, in the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Gilteritinib is a cost-effective novel treatment for patients with R/R FLT3(mut+) AML in the United States.

METHODS: We reported two patients with CML, one at initial diagnosis and one in remission who presented with bilateral subacute visual impairment. Fundal examination revealed bilateral symmetrical leukostatic appearance with increased vascular tortuosity, diffuse retinal infiltrates with size up to 6 disk diameters, retinal hemorrhages, and Roth's spots. OCT showed multiple intra-retinal hyper-reflective foci corresponding to intra-retinal hemorrhages, and outer retinal hyper-reflective foci in area corresponding to retinal infiltrate. The different retinal layers were relatively preserved and distinguishable. RESULTS: White cell count (WCC) were elevated in both patients ranging from 544 to 810 x 10(9)/L. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CML in the patient without prior diagnosis and relapse of CML in another patient. Cytogenetic test detected Abelson murine leukemia (ABL) - breakpoint cluster region (BCR) fusion transcript in both cases. Both patients were started on oral imatinib, subsequently WCC returned to within normal values in both cases. Vision and OCT abnormalities improved and reduction in retinal hemorrhages and infiltrates were observed in follow up. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the important role of ophthalmologists and detailed fundus examination in making a prompt diagnosis of leukemia in patients with visual complaints. Appropriate systemic investigation and hematologist referrals for prompt treatment of CML may improve survival rate and preserve vision.",,"['Szeto, Simon Kh', 'Mohamed, Shaheeda', 'Tsang, Chi Wai', 'Chan, Carmen Km']","['Szeto SK', 'Mohamed S', 'Tsang CW', 'Chan CK']","['The Hong Kong Eye Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', 'The Hong Kong Eye Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', 'The Hong Kong Eye Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', 'The Hong Kong Eye Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211001,United States,Eur J Ophthalmol,European journal of ophthalmology,9110772,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'leukemic retinopathy', 'massive retinal infiltrate', 'optical coherence tomography']",2021/10/02 06:00,2021/10/02 06:00,['2021/10/01 08:39'],"['2021/10/01 08:39 [entrez]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/11206721211048792 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Eur J Ophthalmol. 2021 Oct 1:11206721211048792. doi: 10.1177/11206721211048792.,,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9377-7377', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1443-3726']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PCL has been defined by an absolute number of circulating PCs exceeding 2.0 x 10(9)/L and/or >20% PCs in the total leucocyte count. It is classified as primary PCL, which develops de novo, and secondary PCL, occurring at the late and advanced stages of multiple myeloma (MM). Primary and secondary PCL are clinically and biologically two distinct entities. After the diagnosis, treatment should be immediate and should include a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulator-based combination regimens as induction, followed by stem cell transplantation (SCT) in transplant-eligible individuals who have cleared the peripheral blood of circulating PCs. Due to the rarity of the condition, there have been very few clinical trials. Furthermore, virtually all of the myeloma trials exclude patients with active PCL. The evaluation of response has been defined by the International Myeloma Working Group and consists of both acute leukemia and MM criteria. With conventional chemotherapy, the prognosis of primary PCL has been ominous, with reported overall survival (OS) ranging from 6.8 to 12.6 months. The use of novel agents and autologous SCT appears to be associated with deeper response and an improved survival, although it still remains low. The PCL prognostic index provides a simple score to risk-stratify PCL. The prognosis of secondary PCL is extremely poor, with OS of only 1 month.","['(c) 2020 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

Leukemia diagnosis and management have evolved substantially over the past 30 years and are now relatively precise. The tendency for leukemic cells to be the overwhelming majority of circulating and/or bone marrow cells certainly continues to facilitate developments, as does improved molecular assessment. Furthermore, randomized controlled clinical trials of competing regimens in well-defined populations have advanced treatment as well. Currently, ITP diagnosis and management depend very much on the experience and preferences of the hematologist. There are no unequivocally useful molecular tests, no agreement on which testing needs to be performed, and no consensus on treatment. Future studies using advanced techniques would ideally change this over time but, thus far, progress in ITP has been slow. However, the increasing ability to do single-cell DNA and RNA studies and flow cytometric dissection of small populations of cells could radically change the approach to ITP if critical distinctions were uncovered.","['(c) 2019 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

During the search for a mechanism that augments GvT/GvL without increasing GvH effects, natural killer (NK) cells have clearly attracted attention. Current approaches of NK cell immunotherapy for hematological malignancies involve using methods for in vivo potentiation of NK cell proliferation and activity; adoptive transfer of NK cells from autologous and allogeneic sources [cord blood mononuclear cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CD34(+) stem cells] and NK cell lines; and genetic modification of NK cells. Several cytokines, including interleukin-2 and interleukin-15 take part in the development of NK cells and have been shown to boost NK cell effects both in vivo and ex vivo. Monoclonal antibodies directed towards certain targets, including stimulating CD16, blockade of NK cell receptors, and redirection of cytotoxicity to tumor cells via bi- or tri-specific engagers may promote NK cell function. Despite the relative disappointment with autologous NK cell infusions, the future holds promise in adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells and the development of novel cellular therapeutic strategies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-modified NK cell immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the current status of NK cell-related mechanisms in the therapy of hematologic malignancies, and discuss the future perspectives on adoptive NK cell transfer and other novel cellular immunotherapeutic strategies.","['(c) 2019 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of haploSCT after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), and cyclosporine to prevent rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In this study, 47 patients received RIC using fludarabine, busulfan, and total body irradiation (200 cGy). Unmanipulated peripheral blood grafts were used. GVHD prophylaxis included ATG (4.5 mg/kg day-3 to -1), PTCy (50 mg/kg/day day +3, +4), and cyclosporine from day +5. The median follow-up was 15 months (range 3-27). Thirty one (66%) patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 10 (21%) had high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and 6 (13%) had a myeloproliferative neoplasia. Median age was 60 years (range 22-73). The d+100 cumulative incidences of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD were 17% (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.9-29.1) and 6.4% (1.6-15.9), respectively. The cumulative incidence of moderate-severe chronic GVHD at 1 year was 15.2% (95% CI 6.5-27.1). Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 55.2% (95% CI 39.5-68.4) and 49.5% (95% CI 34.2-63), respectively. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) for all patients at 1 year was 37.1% (95% CI 23.2-51.1). Infection was the main cause of death (26%).

Patients suffering from relapsed/refractory B-ALL have a very poor outcome. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) still represents the only curative approach, but is not so frequently feasible, because of patient's fitness, donor availability, and the ability to achieve a remission prior to HCT. The estimated remission rates with conventional cytotoxic agents are around 30%, but they are short-lived. These disappointing results led to the introduction of new immunologic-based treatments-blinatumomab and inotuzumab. They produced a substantial improvement in terms of response rates, with the ability, in most cases, to induce a minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status. Similarly, T cells engineered to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) have yielded sensational results among patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL, with unexpectedly high MRD-negative complete remissions rates. However, the first studies looking at long-term outcomes after CAR-T infusions told us that a significant fraction of such responses are not durable, and may benefit from a consolidation approach such as an allogeneic HCT.","['(c) 2019 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

A Retrospective Acute Leukemia Working Party-European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant Study.,58-74,10.2991/chi.d.190310.001 [doi],"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FLT3-mutation carries a poor prognosis, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is recommended at first complete remission (CR1). We assessed 462 adults (median age 50 years) with FLT3-mutated AML allografted between 2010 and 2015 from a matched related (40%), unrelated (49%), or haploidentical donor (11%). The median follow-up of alive patients was 39 months. Day-100 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV and III-IV were encountered in 26% and 9%, whereas the 2-year incidence of chronic and extensive chronic GVHD were 34% and 16%, respectively. The 2-year incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 34% and 15%, respectively. The 2-year leukemia-free survival, overall survival (OS), and GVHD relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 51%, 59%, and 38%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, NPM1-mutation, transplantation in CR1, in vivo T-cell depletion, and posttransplant sorafenib improved OS, whereas more than one induction (late CR1) negatively affected OS. Similarly, NPM1-mutation, a haploidentical donor, T-cell depletion, and sorafenib maintenance improved GRFS, whereas late CR1 or persistent disease negatively affected it. In conclusion, FLT3-mutated AML remains a challenge even following allo-SCT. In vivo T-cell depletion and posttransplant sorafenib significantly improve OS and GRFS, and may be considered as standard of care.","['(c) 2019 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

Historically, the first complication in which the role of endothelial damage was elucidated was the veno-oclusive disease/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. In the last two decades, increasing evidence of the implication of the endothelium in the pathophysiology of other syndromes such as capillary leak syndrome, transplant-associated microangiopathy, or even graft versus host disease has accumulated.

TBI is also associated with technical problems, such as dose heterogeneity. With evolving techniques in radiation oncology, it is possible to focus the dose to the entire skeleton while sparing the rest of the body. This technique is called total marrow irradiation (TMI). TMI is able to deliver the same or higher doses to bone marrow while reducing toxicity. With the success of TMI, we are moving toward ultra-personalized conditioning.

Whereas standard treatment for AML until recently consisted of a classic chemotherapy backbone, the incorporation of novel agents targeting pathogenic mutations, myeloid surface markers, and apoptosis-related proteins may become a reality in the next few years. In this review, we outline the therapeutic landscape of recently approved novel agents for AML, including FLT3 inhibitors, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) inhibitors, Bcl-2 antagonists, hedgehog signaling inhibitors, and immunotherapy-based approaches. Some of the future challenges in the field would be to delineate which specific patient subsets derive the most clinical benefit from a given novel agent and, furthermore, which drug combinations will yield the maximal antileukemia effect without increased toxicity. To this end, it is expected that advances in genomic and epigenomic classification of AML will facilitate a rational and optimal choice of these novel agents for AML patients.","['(c) 2019 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

There is no established standard therapy for BPDCN and the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy is limited, with an anticipated median overall survival ranging from 8 to 14 months. No randomized controlled trials have ever been performed to evaluate the benefit of frontline consolidation with an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) in BPDCN. Yet, offering an allograft has become the de facto option in BPDCN, and remains the only known long-term curative option for these patients, even in the modern era of targeted therapies. In our opinion, allo-HCT is recommended as part of frontline consolidation, especially in patients achieving first complete remission and who are deemed capable of tolerating the procedure, as published data show 3- to 4-year progression-free survival ranging from 69% to 74% in this population. Prompt referral to a transplant center, at the time of a diagnosis of BPDCN, is important to confirm allo-HCT candidacy and to initiate the process of identifying a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible donor. Because disease relapse remains a major concern, additional strategies, such as post-allograft consolidation/maintenance therapy, are certainly needed to help further improve outcomes. Finally, patients deemed ineligible to receive an allo-HCT, due to lack of response and/or poor performance status, should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials.","['(c) 2019 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

In our study, we found that cell proliferation was dramatically suppressed by the combination of gilteritinib and HHT. This combination therapy decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, finally inducing apoptosis. We demonstrated that gilteritinib downregulated the expression of FLT3 and downstream signaling, further decreased the mRNA level of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). HHT and combination therapy could upregulate UBE2L6, which induced the degradation of Mcl-1 via ubiquitin-proteasome system.

Currently, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most frequent indication for alloHCT. However, disease relapse remains the main cause of therapy failure. Therefore, concepts of maintaining and, if necessary, reinforcing a strong graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect is crucial for the prognosis and long-term survival of the patients. Over the last decades, it has become evident that effective immunosurveillance after alloHCT is an entangled complex of donor-specific characteristics, leukemia-associated geno- and phenotypes, and acquired resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, adoption of effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, alloreactive and regulatory T-cells with their accompanying receptor repertoire, and cell-cell interactions driven by messenger molecules within the stem cell and the bone marrow niche have important impact. In this review of pre- and posttransplant elements and mechanisms of immunosurveillance, we highlight the most important mechanisms after alloHCT.",['(c) 2021 Kunadt and Stolzel.'],"['Kunadt, Desiree', 'Stolzel, Friedrich']","['Kunadt D', 'Stolzel F']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210924,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'GvL', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'alloHCT', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'graft-versus-leukemia', 'immunosurveillance', 'relapse']",2021/10/02 06:00,2021/10/02 06:01,['2021/10/01 07:24'],"['2021/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/01 07:24 [entrez]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S261721 [doi]', '261721 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2021 Sep 24;13:7411-7427. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S261721. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest for this work.'],,,PMC8478160,,,,,,,,,,

AML is affected by microRNAs (miRNAs) loaded in exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). MiR-425-5p has been reported to participate in different cancer models. However, the function of BM-MSCs-derived exosomal miR-425-5p in AML is unclear. Methods: The expression of miR-425-5p was measured by qRT-PCR in clinical AML samples. The immunophenotype of BM-MSCs was analyzed using antibodies against CD44, CD90, and CD105. The exosome was isolated from BM-MSCs. The effect of BM-MSCs-derived exosomal miR-425-5p on AML was analyzed by CCK-8 assay, Edu assay, transwell assay, flow cytometry in AML cells. qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blot analysis were also conducted in AML cells. Results: The expression levels of miR-425-5p were decreased in CD34 + CD38-AML cells from primary AML patients compared to that from the bone marrow of healthy cases, and were reduced in exosomes from AML patients compared that from healthy cases. Similarly, miR-425-5p was also down-regulated in AML cell lines compared with BM-MSCs. MiR-425-5p was able to express in exosomes from BM-MSCs. CCK-8, Edu, transwell assay and flow cytometry analysis revealed that BM-MSCs-derived exosomal miR-425-5p significantly inhibited cell viability, Edu positive cells, invasion and migration, and induced apoptosis of AML cells. Meanwhile, the expression levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase3 were increased by BM-MSCs-derived exosomal miR-425-5p in cells. MiR-425-5p inhibited the expression of Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP). Moreover, overexpression of WTAP could reverse the miR-425-5p-induced inhibition effect on AML cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Conclusion: BM-MSCs-derived exosomal miR-425-5p inhibits proliferation, invasion and migration of AML cells and induced apoptosis of AML cells by targeting WTAP. Therapeutically, BM-MSCs-derived exosomal miR-425-5p may serve as a potential target for AML therapy.",['(c) 2021 Zhang et al.'],"['Zhang, Ling', 'Khadka, Bijay', 'Wu, Jieying', 'Feng, Yashu', 'Long, Bing', 'Xiao, Ruozhi', 'Liu, Jiajun']","['Zhang L', 'Khadka B', 'Wu J', 'Feng Y', 'Long B', 'Xiao R', 'Liu J']","[""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, 510630, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, 510630, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, 510630, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, 510630, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, 510630, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, 510630, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, 510630, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210924,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BM-MSCs', 'WTAP', 'exosome', 'miR-425-5p']",2021/10/02 06:00,2021/10/02 06:01,['2021/10/01 07:23'],"['2020/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/01 07:23 [entrez]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S286326 [doi]', '286326 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2021 Sep 24;14:4901-4914. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S286326. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest for this work.'],,,PMC8478487,,,,,,,,,,

Decreased sensitivity to GCs in MS patients has been associated with lack of the suppressive effect of GCs on inflammatory molecules as well as increased resistance to apoptosis. We investigated GC-sensitivity by measuring the effect of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) treatment on transactivation of anti-inflammatory and apoptotic genes (GILZ, MCL-1 and NOXA respectively), in accordance to clinical outcome. Thirty nine MS patients were studied: 15 with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 12 with relapsing remitting (RRMS) and 12 with secondary progressive (SPMS) under relapse. Patients underwent treatment with IVMP for 5 days. Blood was drawn before IVMP treatment on day 1 and 1 h after IVMP treatment on days 1 and 5. GIlZ, MCL-1 and NOXA were determined by qPCR. The Expanded Disability Status was evaluated and patients were divided according to their clinical response to IVMP. GILZ and MCL-1 gene expression were significantly higher following first IVMP treatment in responders, compared to non-responders. Furthermore, serum basal cortisol and 1,25-OH Vitamin D levels were significantly higher in clinical-responders as compared to non-clinical responders. Our findings suggest that the differential GILZ and MCL-1 gene expression between clinical-responders and non-clinical responders may implicate the importance of GILZ and MCL-1 as possible markers for predicting glucocorticoid sensitivity and response to GC-therapy in MS patients following first IVMP injection.",['(c) 2021.

ROS levels have been suggested to drive leukemogenesis and is thus a potential novel target for treating AML. MTH1 prevents incorporation of oxidized nucleotides into the DNA to maintain genome integrity and is upregulated in many cancers. Here we demonstrate that hematologic cancers are highly sensitive to MTH1 inhibitor TH1579 (karonudib). A functional precision medicine ex vivo screen in primary AML bone marrow samples demonstrated a broad response profile of TH1579, independent of the genomic alteration of AML, resembling the response profile of the standard-of-care treatments cytarabine and doxorubicin. Furthermore, TH1579 killed primary human AML blast cells (CD45(+)) as well as chemotherapy resistance leukemic stem cells (CD45(+)Lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-)), which are often responsible for AML progression. TH1579 killed AML cells by causing mitotic arrest, elevating intracellular ROS levels, and enhancing oxidative DNA damage. TH1579 showed a significant therapeutic window, was well tolerated in animals, and could be combined with standard-of-care treatments to further improve efficacy. TH1579 significantly improved survival in two different AML disease models in vivo. In conclusion, the preclinical data presented here support that TH1579 is a promising novel anticancer agent for AML, providing a rationale to investigate the clinical usefulness of TH1579 in AML in an ongoing clinical phase I trial. SIGNIFICANCE: The MTH1 inhibitor TH1579 is a potential novel AML treatment, targeting both blasts and the pivotal leukemic stem cells while sparing normal bone marrow cells.",['(c)2021 The Authors;

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structure-activity relationship study was performed in vitro on Jurkat cells to screen the antileukemic activity of LQB-nitrones and analogues and elucidate the mechanisms of action of the most active derivatives. RESULTS: The cynamyl ramification and its ortho position aldehyde substitution improved the antileukemic activity. Three compounds showed an in vitro antiproliferative action, but only 5b induced apoptosis. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms showed increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1/Sdi1, caspase 3, Fas receptor, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. CONCLUSION: The cinnamyl derivative 5b (LQB-461) presented higher antileukemic effects than the prototype terpenyl nitrone, inducing Jurkat cell death by activating both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Therefore, this compound is a new promising candidate drug against leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Thimoteo, Rachell R C', 'Costa, Debora S S', 'Martino, Thiago', 'Barcellos, Julio C F', 'Coelho, Marsen G P', 'Costa, Paulo R R', 'Sabino, Katia C C', 'Simao, Tatiana', 'Dias, Ayres G', 'Justo, Graca']","['Thimoteo RRC', 'Costa DSS', 'Martino T', 'Barcellos JCF', 'Coelho MGP', 'Costa PRR', 'Sabino KCC', 'Simao T', 'Dias AG', 'Justo G']","['Laboratorio Imunologia Aplicada e Bioquimica de Proteinas e Produtos Naturais, IBRAG, UERJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Quimica Bioorganica, IPPN, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Imunologia Aplicada e Bioquimica de Proteinas e Produtos Naturais, IBRAG, UERJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Quimica Bioorganica, IPPN, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Imunologia Aplicada e Bioquimica de Proteinas e Produtos Naturais, IBRAG, UERJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Quimica Bioorganica, IPPN, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Imunologia Aplicada e Bioquimica de Proteinas e Produtos Naturais, IBRAG, UERJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, IBRAG, UERJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Quimica Organica, Instituto de Quimica, UERJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Imunologia Aplicada e Bioquimica de Proteinas e Produtos Naturais, IBRAG, UERJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; magrajusto@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['N-methyl nitrone', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'cinnamyl derivative', 'leukemia']",2021/10/02 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/10/01 06:10'],"['2021/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/01 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['41/10/4929 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.15306 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2021 Oct;41(10):4929-4936. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.15306.,20211012,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imines)', '0 (LQB-278)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (nitrones)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Imines/*chemistry', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nitrogen Oxides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the effect of a third-generation TKI, ponatinib on platelet functions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Collagen-induced platelet aggregation and coated-platelet formation were examined using in vitro and in ex vivo samples of patients on ponatinib therapy. RESULTS: In platelet rich plasma of healthy volunteers, ponatinib at a supra-therapeutic concentration (1,000 nM) significantly impaired collagen induced platelet aggregation (p</=0.01) and reduced the formation of coated-platelets at 150 nM ponatinib concentration (p</=0.05). In addition, upon glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptor activation, a significantly lower percentage of PAC1 binding platelets (p</=0.05) was observed at 1,000 nM final concentration of ponatinib. Platelets, isolated from patients on ponatinib therapy showed impaired collagen elicited aggregation response, already in pre-dose samples compared to healthy donors. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic concentration of ponatinib impairs platelet activation processes elicited by GPVI receptor agonists.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Mezei, Gabriella', 'Batar, Peter', 'Kozma, Laura', 'Illes, Arpad', 'Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Debreceni, Ildiko Beke']","['Mezei G', 'Batar P', 'Kozma L', 'Illes A', 'Kappelmayer J', 'Debreceni IB']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary kappelmayer@med.unideb.hu.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Ponatinib therapy', 'laboratory testing', 'platelet function']",2021/10/02 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/10/01 06:10'],"['2021/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/01 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['41/10/4867 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.15300 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2021 Oct;41(10):4867-4874. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.15300.,20211012,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Collagen/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Pyridazines/*therapeutic use']",10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 266 childhood ALL cases and 266 healthy controls were genotyped for CCND1 rs9344 and rs678653. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the genotypic distribution of rs9344 between childhood ALL patients and healthy controls (p=0.0077). Compared to the AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes were associated with significantly decreased risks of childhood ALL with odds ratio (OR) of 0.65 [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.44-0.94, p=0.0234] and 0.45 (95%CI=0.26-0.78, p=0.0040), respectively. Supporting this, allelic frequency distributions between childhood ALL patients and controls was significantly different (OR=0.68, 95%CI=0.53-0.88, p=0.0025). There was no significant difference in the genotypic and allelic distributions of rs678653 between cases and controls.

Given the potential impact of hyperglycemia on the clinical outcomes of ALL patients, we sought to determine the association of hyperglycemia with the development of infectious complications. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort involving adult Filipino ALL patients admitted at a tertiary referral center. Patients were stratified according to blood glucose levels and infections were classified into microbiologically and clinically defined infections. Logistic regression was performed to determine whether hyperglycemia was associated with the development of infectious complications. RESULTS: Of the 174 patients admitted for ALL, only 76 patients (44%) underwent blood glucose monitoring and were thus included in this study. Hyperglycemia was observed in 64 patients (84.21%). Infectious complications were seen in 56 patients (73.68%), of whom 37 patients (48.68%) had microbiologically defined infections and 19 (25%) had clinically defined infections. The respiratory tract was the most common site of infection and gram-negative bacteria were the predominant isolates. Hyperglycemia significantly increased the likelihood of infectious complications, particularly at blood glucose levels >/= 200 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia is associated with an increased likelihood of infectious complications in Filipino ALL patients. With sepsis being one of the main causes of mortality in this population, our study provides compelling evidence for us to consider routine blood glucose monitoring in order to manage and potentially decrease the occurrence of infections in these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Yet, whether the patient subset in need of a second cycle of intensive induction chemotherapy to reach remission experiences inferior outcomes compared to patients reaching remission after a single cycle of therapy, remains uncertain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 302 consecutive AML patients treated with intensive induction chemotherapy in our institution in 2007-2020. RESULTS: Median patient age was 55 years with a median follow-up duration of 23 months. In terms of European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 classification, 122 patients (40%) were designated as favorable risk disease, 108 patients (36%) were intermediate risk, and 71 patients (24%) were adverse risk. A hundred and seventy-seven patients (60%) attained remission following initial chemotherapy while 58 patients (20%) required an additional cycle of intensive chemotherapy for remission. Patients requiring 2 cycles to reach remission were less likely to be NPM1 mutated (33% versus 51%; P=.025) or be in the ELN 2017 favorable risk category (25% versus 57%; P<.001). In multivariate analysis achievement of remission following 2 cycles of intensive compared with a single cycle resulted in significantly inferior survival [hazard ratio (HR)=1.67, 95% CI, 1.07-2.59; P=.025] whereas leukemia-free survival was not significantly impacted (HR=1.26, 95% CI, 0.85-1.85) (P=.23). Relapse rates also did not differ to a significant degree between groups (45% versus 47%, P=.8).

Systemic inflammation promotes the growth of the JAK2-V617F+ hematopoietic stem cell clone and is associated with constitutive symptoms (eg, fever, cachexia, and fatigue). Therefore, it is being discussed whether anti-inflammatory therapy, in addition to the well-established JAK inhibitor therapy, may be beneficial in the control of constitutive symptoms. Moreover, effective control of the inflammatory microenvironment may contribute to prevent transformation into secondary myelofibrosis and acute leukemia. Given the pivotal role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in MPN and the distinct roles of TNF-alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2 in inflammation, we investigated the therapeutic effects of alphaTNFR1 and alphaTNFR2 antibody treatment in MPN-like disease using the JAK2+/VF knock-in mouse model. Peripheral blood counts, bone marrow/spleen histopathology, and inflammatory cytokine levels in serum were investigated. alphaTNFR2 antibody treatment decreased white blood cells and modulated the serum levels of several cytokines [CXCL2, CXCL5, interleukin-12(p40)], as well as of macrophage colony-stimulating factor, but they lacked efficacy to ameliorate hematocrit and splenomegaly. alphaTNFR1 antibody treatment resulted in the mild suppression of elevated hematocrit of -10.7% and attenuated splenomegaly (22% reduction in spleen weight). In conclusion, our studies show that TNFR1 and TNFR2 play different roles in the biology of JAK2-V617F-induced disease that may be of relevance in future therapeutic settings.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Based on the high affinity (Kd approximately 10(-15) M) of streptavidin (SA) and biotin, radiolabeled biotin may be used to quantify SA-transduced CAR T cells (SA-CAR T cells). Radio-thin-layer chromatography (radio-TLC) and positron emission tomography (PET) are highly sensitive for trace analysis. Our aim was to develop radio-TLC and PET methods to quantify SA-CAR T cells in vitro and in vivo. First, we developed [(68)Ga]-DOTA-biotin. Commercially available SA was used as a standard, and quantitative standard curves were established in vitro and in vivo by radio-TLC and PET. Furthermore, the feasibility of the method was verified in Raji model mice. The linear range of radio-TLC was 0.02 approximately 0.15 pmol/muL with R(2) = 0.9993 in vitro. The linear range of PET was 0.02 approximately 0.76 pmol/muL with R(2) = 0.9986 in vivo. SA in CAR T cells can also be accurately quantified in a Raji leukemia model according to PET imaging.

Two zinc-finger (ZF) repressors, BCL11A and ZBTB7A/LRF, bind directly to the fetal globin promoter elements positioned at -115 and -200, respectively. Here, we describe X-ray structures of the ZBTB7A DNA-binding domain, consisting of four adjacent ZFs, in complex with the -200 sequence element, which contains two copies of four consecutive C:G base pairs. ZF1 and ZF2 recognize the 5' C:G quadruple, and ZF4 contacts the 3' C:G quadruple. Natural non-coding DNA mutations associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) impair ZBTB7A DNA binding, with the most severe disruptions resulting from mutations in the base pairs recognized by ZF1 and ZF2. Our results firmly establish ZBTB7A/LRF as a key molecular regulator of fetal globin expression and inform genome-editing strategies that inhibit repressor binding and boost fetal globin expression to treat hemoglobinopathies.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Because stromal cells have a major role in promoting chemotherapy resistance, they should be included to more realistically model in vitro drug treatment. Here we validated a novel application of the xCELLigence system as a continuous co-culture to assess long-term effects of drug treatment on BCP-ALL cells. We found that bone marrow OP9 stromal cells adhere to the electrodes but are progressively displaced by dividing patient-derived BCP-ALL cells, resulting in reduction of impedance over time. Death of BCP-ALL cells due to drug treatment results in re-adherence of the stromal cells to the electrodes, increasing impedance. Importantly, vincristine inhibited proliferation of sensitive BCP-ALL cells in a dose-dependent manner, correlating with increased impedance. This system was able to discriminate sensitivity of two relapsed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive ALLs to four different targeted kinase inhibitors. Moreover, differences in sensitivity of two CRLF2-drivenBCP-ALL cell lines to ruxolitinib were also seen.

But these models may have suboptimal performance because of patient heterogeneity. The objective of this work is to develop a new modeling approach to predicting short-term mortality that accounts for heterogeneity across multiple subgroups in the presence of a large number of electronic health record predictors. METHODS: We proposed a two-stage approach to addressing heterogeneity among oncology patients of different cancer types for predicting their risk of mortality. Structured data were extracted from the University of Pennsylvania Health System for 20,723 patients of 11 cancer types, where 1,340 (6.5%) patients were deceased. We first modeled the overall risk for all patients without differentiating cancer types, as is done in the current practice. We then developed cancer type-specific models using the overall risk score as a predictor along with preselected type-specific predictors. The overall and type-specific models were compared with respect to discrimination using the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and calibration using the calibration slope. We also proposed metrics that characterize the degree of risk heterogeneity by comparing risk predictors in the overall and type-specific models. RESULTS: The two-stage modeling resulted in improved calibration and discrimination across all 11 cancer types. The improvement in AUPRC was significant for hematologic malignancies including leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. For instance, the AUPRC increased from 0.358 to 0.519 ( = 0.161; 95% CI, 0.102 to 0.224) and from 0.299 to 0.354 ( = 0.055; 95% CI, 0.009 to 0.107) for leukemia and lymphoma, respectively. For all 11 cancer types, the two-stage approach generated well-calibrated risks. A high degree of heterogeneity between type-specific and overall risk predictors was observed for most cancer types. CONCLUSION: Our two-stage modeling approach that accounts for cancer type-specific risk heterogeneity has improved calibration and discrimination than a model agnostic to cancer types.",,"['Oh, Eun Jeong', 'Parikh, Ravi B', 'Chivers, Corey', 'Chen, Jinbo']","['Oh EJ', 'Parikh RB', 'Chivers C', 'Chen J']","['Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'University of Pennsylvania Health System, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,JCO clinical cancer informatics,101708809,IM,,,2021/10/01 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/09/30 17:16'],"['2021/09/30 17:16 [entrez]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/CCI.21.00077 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2021 Sep;5:1015-1023. doi: 10.1200/CCI.21.00077.,20211101,,"['Area Under Curve', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Machine Learning', '*Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",,"['Ravi B.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved annual data on CML burden in 204 countries and regions from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 in 1990-2019. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the temporal trends of CML burden by region, sex, and age group. RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized incidence rate of CML declined weakly over the past few years (EAPC: -1.04), but the number of incident cases increased by 54.1% to 65.8 x 10(3) in 2019. By contrast, a dramatic drop in death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate (EAPCs: -2.55; -2.69) led to a reduction in deaths and DALYs, especially in high-income regions. In 2019, the highest age-standardized death rate was observed in Ethiopia (1.89 per 100,000). The death rate of CML was pronounced among the population age above 70 years. DALYs of CML worldwide were primarily attributable to smoking (12.2%), high body mass index (5.0%), occupational exposure to benzene (0.9%), and occupational exposure to formaldehyde (0.3%) in 2019. CONCLUSION: Although the mortality rate of CML has decreased significantly, the management of patients with CML cannot be neglected, especially in elders and developing regions.",,"['Hu, Yuefen', 'Li, Qizhao', 'Hou, Ming', 'Peng, Jun', 'Yang, Xiaorong', 'Xu, Shuqian']","['Hu Y', 'Li Q', 'Hou M', 'Peng J', 'Yang X', 'Xu S']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,IM,,,2021/10/01 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/09/30 17:15'],"['2021/09/30 17:15 [entrez]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/GO.21.00194 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2021 Sep;7:1429-1441. doi: 10.1200/GO.21.00194.,20211102,,"['Aged', 'Global Burden of Disease', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Risk Factors']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2787-6884', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9866-3029', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7071-8550']",,PMC8492379,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To study the association of LPL expression with the genetic variants of the TP53 gene since both genes are involved in lipid metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of LPL mRNA was measured in peripheral blood mononuclears of 45 CLL patients with UM IGHV genes by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mutational status of IGHV genes and TP53 genotyping (rs1042522, rs1642785, rs17883323, rs2909430, rs145153611, rs113530090, rs12947788, rs12951053, and rs17878362) were performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Observed CLL patients were divided on groups with low (11.17 +/- 2.66) and high (275.48 +/- 39.37) LPL expression. In CLL patients with UM IGHV genes and low LPL expression we found an increased frequency of rs1042522 G (p = 0.0036), rs1642785 C (p = 0.0001), and rs17878362A2 alleles (p = 0.0091). The possible functional significance of these changes is discussed. CONCLUSION: Some polymorphic variants of TP53 may be genetic modifiers for LPL expression level in CLL leukemic B-cells.

Since AL patients with 11q23/MLL rearrangements are attributed to cytogenetic categories of AL with a poor or intermediate risk prognosis, cytogenetic methods should be included in the standard examination of AL patients for diagnosis, prognosis and selection of the optimal treatment strategy.",,"['Zotova, O V', 'Lukianova, A S', 'Valchuk, M O', 'Karol, Yu S', 'Shalay, O O', 'Novak, V L', 'Loginsky, V E']","['Zotova OV', 'Lukianova AS', 'Valchuk MO', 'Karol YS', 'Shalay OO', 'Novak VL', 'Loginsky VE']","['State Institute ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79057, Ukraine.', 'Medical Biology Centre ""Genom"", Kyiv 04216, Ukraine.', 'State Institute ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79057, Ukraine.', 'Communal Noncommercial Enterprise ""Municipal Clinical Hospital numero sign 5"", Lviv 79057, Ukraine.', 'State Institute ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79057, Ukraine.', 'State Institute ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79057, Ukraine.', 'State Institute ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79057, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,IM,,,2021/10/01 06:00,2021/10/01 06:00,['2021/09/30 13:09'],"['2021/09/30 13:09 [entrez]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['16495 [pii]', '10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-43-no-3.16495 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2021 Sep;43(3):229-233. doi: 10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-43-no-3.16495.,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 42 de novo adult B-ALL patients, 19 BCR/ABL positive, were included in this study. Soluble receptor alpha for IL-2 (sIL-2Ralpha), soluble receptor for IL-6 (sIL-6R), soluble receptor for TNF-alpha type I and II (sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were measured by biochip array technology at diagnosis and in complete remission (CR). RESULTS: At diagnosis of B-ALL, we found significantly higher levels of sIL-2Ralpha, sIL-6R, sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2 and significantly lower levels MMP-9 in comparison with CR (p < 0.001 in all cases). BCR/ABL positive patients had higher levels of sIL-2Ralpha at diagnosis (r = 0.484; p = 0.014). Serum levels of evaluated cytokines were not associated with achievement of CR after one cycle of induction therapy, RFS or OS. CONCLUSION: Serum levels of all evaluated cytokines are significantly altered in newly diagnosed B-ALL reflecting activity of the disease. No significant correlations with response to first induction therapy, RFS or OS were found.

We update the results of CBT, as the first allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation after this conditioning regimen, in 169 patients with a median long-term follow-up of 10.4 years. The median age was 43 years (range, 16 to 59 years). Ninety-four patients (56%) were in non-remission at the time of CBT, and 124 patients (73%) were acute myeloid leukemia. The median cryopreserved cord blood total nucleated cell dose and CD34(+) cell dose was 2.40 x 10(7)/kg and 0.93 x 10(5)/kg, respectively. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at 42 days was 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.6-97.3%). Among the whole cohort, 105 patients were still alive at the end of the study period. The cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality at 10 years were 26.0% (95% CI: 19.5-33.0%) and 16.9% (95% CI: 11.4-23.4%), respectively. There was an overall survival probability of 62.5% (95% CI: 54.3-69.7%) at 10 years. Higher disease risk index alone significantly affected higher overall mortality (hazard ratio 2.21, P = 0.003) in multivariate analysis. These outcomes demonstrate that G-CSF-combined myeloablative conditioning could have favorable long-term remission rates for adult patients with myeloid malignancies undergoing single-unit CBT.","['(c) 2021.

We investigated the in-hospital mortality according to early removal of CVCs and the factors influencing the mortality in patients with acute leukemia undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. This study retrospectively analyzed the hospital record data of 278 patients with acute leukemia treated with non-tunneled CVCs and remission induction chemotherapy in a single institution. Bloodstream infection was more common (p < 0.0001) and median peak C-reactive protein (CRP) levels after neutropenic fever were significantly higher (23.3 vs. 14.5 mg/dl, p = 0.003) in the group with early removal than in the group with maintenance of the CVC. Multivariate analysis of the patients revealed a significant decrease in the mortality with female gender (odds ratio (OR): 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06-0.54, p = 0.002) and a significant increase in the mortality according to the peak CRP (OR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.17, p < 0.0001). By contrast, early removal of the CVC had no significant effect on the mortality (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.54-2.47, p = 0.706) in univariate analysis. Furthermore, subsequent bloodstream infection after clinical decision for maintenance or early removal of the CVC was confirmed more frequently in the group with early removal (early removal, 22.6%; maintenance, 7.6%, p < 0.0001). Early removal of the CVC had no benefit regarding the mortality and prophylaxis of bloodstream infection in patients with acute leukemia undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. Therefore, maintaining a CVC for as long as possible may be considered, if catheter-related bloodstream infection is not strongly suspected.","['(c) 2021.

Despite ground-breaking genetic discoveries, JMML remains difficult to diagnose given its diverse clinical features and disease course. A total of 24 patients with JMML were diagnosed and treated at a single institution, and their genetic profiles and association with clinical and laboratory characteristics were analysed. In all, 22 of the patients received allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning, mostly from a haploidentical family donor. RAS pathway mutations were identified in 88% of patients: PTPN11 [nine (38%)], NRAS [nine (38%)], KRAS [two (8%)], NF1 [five (21%)] and CBL [one (4%)]. Secondary mutations were found in 25% of patients: SETBP1, JAK3, ASXL1, GATA2, KIT, KDM6A, and BCOR. Six patients showed cytogenetic abnormalities, including three with monosomy 7. The estimated 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (+/- standard error) of the entire cohort were 58.9 (10.9)% and 73.5 (10.8)% respectively.

Treatment options are limited to intrathecal therapy, high-dose cytarabine, high-dose methotrexate, and radiotherapy. Novel strategies are needed. Venetoclax has recently been approved by the FDA, in combination with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine, for elderly adults or patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy affected by AML. However, little is known on its efficacy in patients with leptomeningeal involvement. Here, we present a case of a 52-year-old patient affected by AML relapsed at CNS after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who was treated with venetoclax. We evaluated the concentration of the drug in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by HPLC MS/MS method on three different occasions to verify the penetration of the drug through the brain-blood barrier and we observed that the concentration in CSF was similar to the IC50 established in vitro.","['(c) 2021.

This was the first, and is still the only, herpesvirus vaccine. Early studies showed promise, but the vaccine was rigorously tested on immunosuppressed patients because of their high risk of fatal varicella; vaccination proved to be lifesaving. Subsequently, the vaccine was found to be safe and effective in healthy children. Eventually, varicella vaccine became a component of measles mumps rubella vaccine, 2 doses of which are administered in the USA to ~90% of children. The incidence of varicella has dropped dramatically in the USA since vaccine-licensure in 1995. Varicella vaccine is also associated with a decreased incidence of zoster and is protective for susceptible adults. Today, immunocompromised individuals are protected against varicella due to vaccine-induced herd immunity. Latent infection with varicella zoster virus occurs after vaccination; however, the vaccine strain is impaired for its ability to reactivate.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

OBJECTIVES: We prospectively examined the association between multivitamin use and risks of overall and site-specific cancer in a large, well-characterized cohort to ascertain potential preventive or harmful relationships. METHODS: We examined 489,640 participants ages 50-71 in the NIH-American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health Study who were enrolled from 1995 to 1998. We linked to 11 state cancer registries in order to identify incident cancers. Multivitamin use was assessed by a baseline questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression models of multivitamin use were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for cancer risks in men and women, adjusted for potential confounders, including age, BMI, smoking, physical activity, the Healthy Eating Index 2015 score, and use of single-vitamin/-mineral supplements. RESULTS: A slightly higher overall cancer risk was observed in men (but not women) who consumed 1 or more multivitamins daily compared to nonusers [HRs, 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01-1.04) and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00-1.07), respectively; P-trend = 0.002]. The latter reflected higher risks for prostate cancer (HR, 1.04; 95% CI: 0.98-1.10; P-trend = 0.005), lung cancer (HR, 1.07; 95% CI: 0.96-1.20; P-trend = 0.003), and leukemia (HR, 1.26; 95% CI: 1.02-1.57; P-trend = 0.003). Taking more than 1 multivitamin daily was also strongly positively associated with the risk of oropharyngeal cancer in women (HR, 1.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.24; P-trend < 0.0001). By contrast, daily multivitamin use was inversely associated with the colon cancer risk in both sexes (HR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.93; P-trend = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence to support a cancer-preventive role for multivitamin use, with the exception of colon cancer, in both sexes in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. In addition, slightly higher risks of overall, prostate, and lung cancer, as well as leukemia, were observed for greater multivitamin use in men, with a higher oropharyngeal cancer risk in women.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

However, it is not well-understood how radiation targeted to a small region of the body can lead to broad changes in behavior. In this study, we used targeted pelvic irradiation of healthy male mice to test whether inflammatory signaling mediates changes in voluntary physical activity levels. First, we tested the relationship between radiation dose, blood cell counts, and fatigue-like behavior measured as voluntary wheel-running activity. Next, we used oral minocycline treatments to reduce inflammation and found that minocycline reduces, but does not eliminate, the fatigue-like behavioral changes induced by radiation. We also used a strain of mice lacking the MyD88 adaptor protein and found that these mice also showed less fatigue-like behavior than the wild-type controls. Finally, using serum and brain tissue samples, we determined changes in inflammatory signaling induced by irradiation in wild-type, minocycline treated, and MyD88 knockout mice. We found that irradiation increased serum levels of IL-6, a change that was partially reversed in mice treated with minocycline or lacking MyD88.

FLT3 TKI have yielded limited improvements to clinical outcomes. One reason for this is TKI inhibition by endogenous factors. We characterized plasma protein binding of FLT3 TKI, specifically staurosporine-derivatives (STS-TKI) by alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP); simulating its effects upon drug efficacy. Human AGP inhibits the anti-proliferative activity of STS-TKI in FLT3-ITD-dependent cells, with IC50 shifts higher than clinically achievable. This is not seen with non-human plasma.

It is now well accepted that relapse is due to a persisting subset of AML cells known as leukemia-initiating cells or leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM), a specialized niche that coordinates HSC self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. HSCs are divided into two types: long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) and short-term HSCs, where LT-HSCs are typically quiescent and act as a reserve of HSCs. Like LT-HSCs, a quiescent population of LSCs also exist. Like LT-HSCs, quiescent LSCs have low metabolic activity and receive pro-survival signals from the BMM, making them resistant to drugs, and upon discontinuation of therapy, they can become activated and re-establish the disease. Several studies have shown that the activation of quiescent LSCs may sensitize them to cytotoxic drugs. However, it is very difficult to experimentally model the quiescence-inducing BMM. Here we report that culturing AML cells with bone marrow stromal cells, transforming growth factor beta-1 and hypoxia in a three-dimensional system can replicate the quiescence-driving BMM. A quiescent-like state of the AML cells was confirmed by reduced cell proliferation, increased percentage of cells in the G0 cell cycle phase and a decrease in absolute cell numbers, expression of markers of quiescence, and reduced metabolic activity. Furthermore, the culture could be established as co-axial microbeads, enabling high-throughput screening, which has been used to identify combination drug treatments that could break BMM-mediated LSC quiescence, enabling the eradication of quiescent LSCs.","[""Copyright (c) 2021 O'Reilly, Zeinabad, Nolan, Sefy, Williams, Tarunina,"", 'Hernandez, Choo and Szegezdi.']","[""O'Reilly, Eimear"", 'Zeinabad, Hojjat Alizadeh', 'Nolan, Caoimhe', 'Sefy, Jamileh', 'Williams, Thomas', 'Tarunina, Marina', 'Hernandez, Diana', 'Choo, Yen', 'Szegezdi, Eva']","[""O'Reilly E"", 'Zeinabad HA', 'Nolan C', 'Sefy J', 'Williams T', 'Tarunina M', 'Hernandez D', 'Choo Y', 'Szegezdi E']","['Apoptosis Research Centre, Department of Biochemistry, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Department of Biochemistry, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Department of Biochemistry, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Department of Biochemistry, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Plasticell Ltd., Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst, Stevenage, United Kingdom.', 'Plasticell Ltd., Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst, Stevenage, United Kingdom.', 'Plasticell Ltd., Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst, Stevenage, United Kingdom.', 'Plasticell Ltd., Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst, Stevenage, United Kingdom.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Department of Biochemistry, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210913,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow microenvironment', 'leukemic stem cell', 'quiescence', 'three-dimensional model']",2021/10/01 06:00,2021/10/01 06:01,['2021/09/30 07:17'],"['2021/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/30 07:17 [entrez]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.662868 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Sep 13;9:662868. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.662868. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['MT, TW, DH, and YC were employed by Plasticell Ltd., is the owner of the', 'CombiCult(R) technology.

However, little is known of the prognostic value of EVI1 (high) in pediatric AML. This study aimed to examine the biological and prognostic significance of EVI1 (high) in uniformly treated pediatric patients with AML from a large cohort of seven centers in China. Methods: A diagnostic assay was developed to determine the relative EVI1 expression using a single real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 421 newly diagnosed pediatric AML patients younger than 14 years from seven centers in southern China. All patients were treated with a uniform protocol, but only 383 patients were evaluated for their treatment response. The survival data were included in the subsequent analysis (n = 35 for EVI1 (high), n = 348 for EVI1 (low)). Results: EVI1 (high) was found in 9.0% of all 421 pediatric patients with de novo AML. EVI1 (high) was predominantly found in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (FAB M7), MLL rearrangements, and unfavorable cytogenetic aberrance, whereas it was mutually exclusive with t (8; 21), inv (16)/t (16; 16), CEBPA, NPM1, or C-KIT mutations. In the univariate Cox regression analysis, EVI1 (high) had a significantly adverse 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.821 and 2.401, p = 0.036 and 0.005, respectively]. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, EVI1 (high) was an independent prognostic factor for the OS (HR = 2.447, p = 0.015) but not EFS (HR = 1.556, p = 0.174). Furthermore, EVI1 (high) was an independent adverse predictor of the OS and EFS of patients with MLL rearrangements (univariate analysis: HR = 9.921 and 7.253, both p < 0.001; multivariate analysis: HR = 7.186 and 7.315, p = 0.005 and 0.001, respectively). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete remission (CR1) provided EVI1 (high) patients with a tendential survival benefit when compared with chemotherapy as a consolidation (5-year EFS: 68.4% vs. 50.8%, p = 0.26; 5-year OS: 65.9% vs. 54.8%, p = 0.45). Conclusion: It could be concluded that EVI1 (high) can be detected in approximately 10% of pediatric AML cases. It is predominantly present in unfavorable cytogenetic subtypes and predicts adverse outcomes. Whether pediatric patients with EVI1 (high) AML can benefit from HSCT in CR1 needs to be researched further.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zheng, Huang, Le, Zheng, Hua, Chen, Feng, Li, Zheng, Xu, He,', 'He, Li and Hu.']","['Zheng, Yongzhi', 'Huang, Yan', 'Le, Shaohua', 'Zheng, Hao', 'Hua, Xueling', 'Chen, Zaisheng', 'Feng, Xiaoqin', 'Li, Chunfu', 'Zheng, Mincui', 'Xu, Honggui', 'He, Yingyi', 'He, Xiangling', 'Li, Jian', 'Hu, Jianda']","['Zheng Y', 'Huang Y', 'Le S', 'Zheng H', 'Hua X', 'Chen Z', 'Feng X', 'Li C', 'Zheng M', 'Xu H', 'He Y', 'He X', 'Li J', 'Hu J']","['Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Southern Medical University/Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', ""Nanfang-Chunfu Children's Institute of Hematology & Oncology, TaiXin Hospital, Dongguan, China."", ""Hematology and Oncology, Hunan Children's Hospital, Changsha, China."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Pediatrics, People's Hospital of Hunan Province, Changsha, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210913,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['EVI1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'adverse outcome', 'pediatric', 'prognostic factor', 'transplantation']",2021/10/01 06:00,2021/10/01 06:01,['2021/09/30 07:16'],"['2021/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/30 07:16 [entrez]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.712747 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 13;11:712747. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.712747. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8474639,,,,,,,,,,

TRAF1 is overexpressed in many B cell cancers including refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Little has been done to assess the role of TRAF1 in human cancer. Here we show that the protein kinase C related kinase Protein Kinase N1 (PKN1) is required to protect TRAF1 from cIAP-mediated degradation during constitutive CD40 signaling in lymphoma. We show that the active phospho-Thr774 form of PKN1 is constitutively expressed in CLL but minimally detected in unstimulated healthy donor B cells. Through a screen of 700 kinase inhibitors, we identified two inhibitors, OTSSP167, and XL-228, that inhibited PKN1 in the nanomolar range and induced dose-dependent loss of TRAF1 in RAJI cells. OTSSP167 or XL-228 treatment of primary patient CLL samples led to a reduction in TRAF1, pNF-kappaB p65, pS6, pERK, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins, and induction of activated caspase-3. OTSSP167 synergized with venetoclax in inducing CLL death, correlating with loss of TRAF1, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2. Although correlative, these findings suggest the PKN1-TRAF1 signaling axis as a potential new target for CLL. These findings also suggest the use of the orally available inhibitor OTSSP167 in combination treatment with venetoclax for TRAF1 overexpressing CLL.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

However, the cellular function of circRNAs and exosomal circRNAs has not been well explored in Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Methods: Differentially expressed circRNAs were identified by a human circRNA microarray analysis. The expression of hsa_circ_0058493 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and exosomes was verified using quantitative real-time PCR. Short hairpin RNAs against hsa_circ_0058493 were constructed to silence the expression of circ_0058493. CCK8, flow cytometry and EdU assay were performed to investigate the biological functions of circ_0058493. Results: Hsa_circ_0058493 was significantly overexpressed in the PBMCs of CML patients and high level of circ_0058493 was associated with the poor clinical efficacy of imatinib. Silencing the expression of circ_0058493 significantly inhibited the development of imatinib-resistant CML cells. miR-548b-3p was overexpressed in circ_0058493-downregulated CML cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that circ_0058493 might exert its regulatory function acting as a ""sponge"" of miR-548b-3p. Moreover, hsa_circ_0058493 was significantly enriched in the exosomes derived from imatinib-resistant CML cells.

METHODS: We aimed to investigate the antitumor activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors using in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of MPM. RESULTS: Based on publicly available transcriptomic data of MPM, patients with CDK4 or CDK6 overexpression had shorter overall survival. Treatment with abemaciclib or palbociclib at 100 nM significantly decreased cell proliferation in all cell models evaluated. Both CDK4/6 inhibitors significantly induced G1 cell cycle arrest, thereby increasing cell senescence and increased the expression of interferon signalling pathway and tumour antigen presentation process in culture models of MPM. In vivo preclinical studies showed that palbociclib significantly reduced tumour growth and prolonged overall survival using distinct xenograft models of MPM implanted in athymic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of MPM with CDK4/6 inhibitors decreased cell proliferation, mainly by promoting cell cycle arrest at G1 and by induction of cell senescence. Our preclinical studies provide evidence for evaluating CDK4/6 inhibitors in the clinic for the treatment of MPM.","['(c) 2021.

It is currently unknown what determines if a person harboring a somatic TET2 mutation will progress to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Here we develop a zebrafish tet2 mutant through which we show that tet2 loss leads to restricted hematopoietic differentiation combined with a modest upregulation of p53, which is also characteristic of many inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. Uniquely in the context of emergency hematopoiesis by external stimuli, such as infection or cytokine stimulation, lack of tet2 leads hematopoietic stem cells to undergo excessive proliferation, resulting in an accumulation of immature cells, which are poised to become leukemogenic following additional genetic/epigenetic perturbations. This same phenomenon observed in zebrafish extends to human hematopoietic stem cells, identifying TET2 as a critical relay switch in the context of stress hematopoiesis.","['(c) 2021.

However, reports on the prognostic impact of various translocations causing KMT2Ar are conflicting. Less is known about associated mutations and their prognostic impact. In a retrospective analysis, we identified 172 adult patients with KMT2Ar AML and compared them to 522 age-matched patients with diploid AML. KMT2Ar AML had fewer mutations, most commonly affecting RAS and FLT3 without significant impact on prognosis, except for patients with >/=2 mutations with lower overall survival (OS). KMT2Ar AML had worse outcomes compared with diploid AML when newly diagnosed and at relapse, especially following second salvage (median OS of 2.4 vs 4.8 months, P < 0.0001). Therapy-related KMT2Ar AML (t-AML) had worse outcomes compared with de novo KMT2Ar AML (median OS of 0.7 years vs 1.4 years, P < 0.0001). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) in first remission was associated with improved OS (5-year, 52 vs 14% for no allo-HSCT, P < 0.0001).

Acalabrutinib is a second-generation BTK inhibitor with greater BTK selectivity. This analysis characterizes pooled CV adverse events (AEs) data in patients with CLL who received acalabrutinib monotherapy in clinical trials (NCT02029443; NCT02475681; NCT02970318; NCT02337829). Acalabrutinib was given orally at total daily doses of 100-400 mg, later switched to 100 mg twice daily, and continued until disease progression or toxicity. Data from 762 patients (median age: 67 years [range, 32-89]; median follow-up: 25.9 months [range, 0-58.5]) were analyzed. Cardiac AEs of any grade were reported in 129 patients (17%; grade >/=3, n=37 [5%]) and led to treatment discontinuation in 7 patients (1%). The most common any-grade cardiac AEs were atrial fibrillation/flutter (5%), palpitations (3%), and tachycardia (2%). Overall, 91% of patients with cardiac AEs had CV risk factors before acalabrutinib treatment. Among 38 patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter events, 7 (18%) had prior history of arrhythmia or atrial fibrillation/flutter. Hypertension AEs were reported in 67 patients (9%), 43 (64%) of whom had a preexisting history of hypertension; no patients discontinued treatment due to hypertension. No sudden cardiac deaths were reported. Overall, these data demonstrate a low incidence of new-onset cardiac AEs with acalabrutinib in patients with CLL. Findings from the head-to-head, randomized trial of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib in patients with high-risk CLL (NCT02477696) will prospectively assess differences in CV toxicity between the two agents.",,"['Brown, Jennifer R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Sharman, Jeff P', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Stephens, Deborah M', 'Sun, Clare', 'Jurczak, Wojciech', 'Pagel, John M', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Patel, Priti', 'Tao, Lin', 'Kuptsova-Clarkson, Nataliya', 'Moslehi, Javid', 'Furman, Richard R']","['Brown JR', 'Byrd JC', 'Ghia P', 'Sharman JP', 'Hillmen P', 'Stephens DM', 'Sun C', 'Jurczak W', 'Pagel JM', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Patel P', 'Tao L', 'Kuptsova-Clarkson N', 'Moslehi J', 'Furman RR']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA. jennifer_brown@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano.', 'Willamette Valley Cancer Institute/US Oncology, Eugene, OR.', ""St. James's University Hospital, Leeds."", 'University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Krakow.', 'Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA.', 'AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210930,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2021/10/01 06:00,2021/10/01 06:00,['2021/09/30 03:38'],"['2021/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 03:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2021.278901 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Sep 30. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2021.278901.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published studies have reported an increased incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with the use of PTCy. Limited data exist on the incidence and outcomes of infection with non-CMV herpesviruses (NCHV) in this setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cumulative incidence of NCHV infections and the association of NCHV infections with transplantation-specific outcomes in recipients of haploidentical transplantation with PTCy (HaploCy), matched sibling donor transplantation with PTCy (SibCy), and matched sibling donor transplantation with calcineurin inhibitor-based prophylaxis (SibCNI). We hypothesized that, like CMV infection, HaploCy recipients of also will have a higher risk of NCHV infections. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research database, we analyzed 2765 patients (HaploCy, n = 757; SibCNI, n = 1605; SibCy, n = 403) who had undergone their first hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) between 2012 and 2017 for acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. The cumulative incidence of NCHV at 6 months post-NCT was 13.9% (99% confidence interval], 10.8% to 17.3%) in the HaploCy group, 10.7% (99% CI, 7.1% to 15%) in the SibCy group, and 5.7% (99% CI, 4.3% to 7.3%) in the Sib CNI group (P < .001). This was due primarily to a higher frequency of human herpesvirus 6 viremia reported in patients receiving PTCy. The incidence of Epstein-Barr viremia was low in all groups, and no cases of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder were seen in either PTCy group. The incidence of NCHV organ disease was low in all 3 cohorts. The development of NCHV infection was associated with increased treatment-related mortality, particularly in the HaploCy group. There was no association with the development of GVHD, relapse, or disease-free survival. Patients in PTCy cohorts who did not develop NCHV infection had lower rates of cGVHD. This study demonstrates that the use of PTCy is associated with an increased risk of NCHV infection. The development of NCHV infection was associated with increased nonrelapse mortality, especially in the HaploCy group. Prospective trials should consider viral surveillance strategies in conjunction with assessment of immune reconstitution for a better understanding of the clinical relevance of viral reactivation in different HCT settings.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

While multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, including Ruxolitinib monotherapy and/or its combination with chemotherapy, are being tested, their efficacy is reportedly limited. To identify molecules/pathways relevant for IgH-CRLF2-r ALL pathogenesis, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 dropout screens in the presence or absence of Ruxolitinib using two IgH-CRLF2-r ALL lines that differ in RAS mutational status. To do so, we employed a baboon envelope pseudotyped lentiviral vector system, which enabled, for the first time, highly efficient transduction of human B cells. While sgRNAs targeting CRLF2, IL7RA or JAK1/2 significantly affected cell fitness in both lines, those targeting STAT5A, STAT5B or STAT3 did not, suggesting that STAT signaling is largely dispensable for IgH-CRLF2-r ALL cell survival. We show that regulators of RAS signaling are critical for cell fitness and Ruxolitinib sensitivity and that CRKL depletion enhances Ruxolitinib sensitivity in RAS wild-type (WT) cells. Gilteritinib, a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks CRKL phosphorylation, effectively killed RAS WT IgH-CRLF2-r ALL cells in vitro and in vivo, either alone or combined with Ruxolitinib. We further show that combining Gilteritinib with Trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, is an effective means to target IgH-CRLF2-r ALL cells regardless of RAS mutational status.

Previous reports based on fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis have suggested that ETV6-PDGFRA fusions are present in these patients despite the absence of eosinophilia, which is typically found in other hematopoietic malignancies with PDGFRA not-containing fusions. We first detected an ETV6-SCFD2 fusion by targeted RNA sequencing in a patient with t(4;12)(q12;p13) who had previously been diagnosed with an ETV6-PDGFRA fusion by FISH analysis but failed to respond to imatinib. We then retrospectively identified four additional AML patients with t(4;12)(q12;p13) with apparent ETV6-PDGFRA fusions using chromosome and FISH analysis and applied targeted RNA sequencing to archival material. We again detected rearrangements between ETV6 and non-PDGFRA 4q12 genes including SCFD2, CHIC2 and GSX2. None of the three patients who received imatinib based on the incorrect assumption of an ETV6-PDGFRA fusion responded. Our findings highlight the importance of using a sequencing-based assay to confirm the presence of targetable gene fusions, particularly in genomic regions such as 4q12 with many clinically relevant genes that are too close to resolve by chromosome or FISH analysis. Finally, combining our data and review of the literature, we show that sequence-confirmed ETV6-PDGFRA fusions are typically found in eosinophilic disorders (3 of 3 cases), and patients with t(4;12)(q12;p13) without eosinophilia are found to have other 4q12 partners on sequencing (17 of 17 cases).",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Mueller, Sarah Beth', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Le, Long Phi', 'Dias-Santagata, Dora', 'Lennerz, Jochen K', 'Iafrate, Anthony John', 'Marble, Hetal', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Weinstock, Matthew', 'Luskin, Marlise R', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Nardi, Valentina']","['Mueller SB', 'Dal Cin P', 'Le LP', 'Dias-Santagata D', 'Lennerz JK', 'Iafrate AJ', 'Marble H', 'Brunner AM', 'Weinstock M', 'Luskin MR', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stone RM', 'Nardi V']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."", 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210929,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/09/30 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2021/09/29 17:24'],"['2021/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/29 17:24 [entrez]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['477073 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005280 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2021 Sep 29. pii: 477073. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005280.,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7985-2155', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2434-4978', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8203-0622', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5781-4529', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7865-2306']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MiR-20a-5p has been reported to function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in several tumors, but the clinical significance and regulatory mechanisms of miR-20a-5p in AML cells have not been fully understood. In this study, we found miR-20a-5p was significantly decreased in bone marrow from AML patients, compared with that in healthy controls. Moreover, decreased miR-20a-5p expression was correlated with risk status and poor survival prognosis in AML patients. Overexpression of miR-20a-5p suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in two AML cell lines (THP-1 and U937) using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis. Moreover, miR-20a-5p overexpression attenuated tumor growth in vivo by performing tumor xenograft experiments. Luciferase reporter assay and western blot demonstrated that protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit (PPP6C) as a target gene of miR-20a-5p was negatively regulated by miR-20a-5p in AML cells. Furthermore, PPP6C knockdown imitated, while overexpression reversed the effects of miR-20a-5p overexpression on AML cell proliferation, cell cycle G1/S transition and apoptosis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that miR-20a-5p/PPP6C represent a new therapeutic target for AML and a potential diagnostic marker for AML therapy.",,"['Bao, Fengchang', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Pei, Xiaohang', 'Lian, Cheng', 'Liu, Yanhui', 'Tan, Hongna', 'Lei, Pingchong']","['Bao F', 'Zhang L', 'Pei X', 'Lian C', 'Liu Y', 'Tan H', 'Lei P']","[""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", ""Blood institute, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", ""Medical Imaging Center, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210929,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/09/30 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/09/29 17:20'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/29 17:20 [entrez]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0256995 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-08740 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Sep 29;16(9):e0256995. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0256995. eCollection 2021.,20211118,"['0 (MIRN20a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (protein phosphatase 6)']","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/deficiency/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'THP-1 Cells', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",9,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-7148-1652'],,PMC8480815,,,,,,,,,,

Given this intersection, identifying risk factors associated with suicidal risk among AYA with cancer is critical. OBJECTIVE: To identify characteristics associated with suicide among AYA with cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of AYA (aged 15-39) during 1975-2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was conducted. Clinical and demographic factors associated with death by suicide among the AYA cancer population were compared to (i) US population normative data (standardized mortality ratios [SMRs]) and (ii) other AYA individuals with cancer (odds ratios). RESULTS: In total, 922 suicides were found in 500,366 AYA with cancer (0.18%), observed for 3,198,261 person-years. The SMR for AYA with cancer was 34.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31.4-36.9). Suicide risk was particularly high in females (SMR = 43.4, 95% CI: 37.2-50.4), unmarried persons (SMR = 50.6, 95% CI: 44.7-57.1), those with metastatic disease (SMR = 45.2, 95% CI: 33.1-60.3), or certain histological subtypes (leukemia, central nervous system, and soft tissue sarcoma). Risk generally reduced over time, however remained elevated >/=5 years following a cancer diagnosis (SMR > 5 years = 28.1, 95% CI: 25.4-31.0). When comparing those who died from suicide and those who did not, the following factors demonstrated significant associations: sex (males > females), race (White ethnicity > Black/other ethnicity), relationship status (never married > other), and disease stage (distant > localized). CONCLUSIONS: Death due to suicide/non-accidental injury is high compared to normative data, requiring increased awareness among health-care providers, suicide risk monitoring in AYA, and appropriately tailored psychosocial interventions.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are prone to both thrombosis and bleeding, calling for special care during COVID-19. We reviewed the clinical features of MPN patients with COVID-19, suggesting guidance for treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: One study by the European LeukemiaNet collected 175 MPN patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, from February to May 2020. Patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were at higher risk of mortality (48%) in comparison with essential thrombocythemia (ET) (25%) and polycythemia vera (19%); the risk of death was higher in those patients who abruptly discontinued ruxolitinib. In patients followed at home, in regular wards, or in ICU, the thrombosis rate was 1.0%, 2.8%, and 18.4%, respectively. Independent risk factors for thrombosis were ET phenotype, transfer to ICU, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio; major bleeding occurred in 4.3% of patients, particularly those with PMF. MPN patients with non-severe COVID-19 treated at home should continue their primary or secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis with aspirin or oral anticoagulants. In the case of hospitalization, patients assuming aspirin should add low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at standard doses. In contrast, LMWH at intermediate/therapeutic doses should replace oral anticoagulants prescribed for atrial fibrillation or previous venous thromboembolism. Intermediate/high doses of LMWH can also be considered in ICU patients with ET, particularly in the case of a rapid decline in the number of platelets and progressive respiratory failure.","['(c) 2021.

The interaction of these immune checkpoints remains unclear in the leukemic microenvironment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We performed an immunophenotypic study of bone marrow in 37 newly diagnosed AML patients. High levels of TIM-3 expression on AML blasts were correlated with first 7 + 3 induction failure (CR 16.2% vs. non-CR 36.4%, p = .038). In contrast, high TIM-3 levels on natural killer (NK) cells were associated with complete remission (CR) status after induction (CR 24.7% vs. non-CR 6.5%, p = .035). Few PD-L1 positive AML blasts and PD-1 or PD-L1 positive NK cells were observed.

However, there is scarce studies when comparing the data of next-generation sequencing and flow cytometry for monitoring disease progression, particularly how they might supplement one another when used in tandem. METHODS: We investigated 107 patients via retrospective analysis using follow-up MFC and NGS data with a total of 717 MFC and 247 NGS studies to compare these methods in monitoring minimal/measurable residual disease. RESULTS: 197 instances were MFC(+) /NGS(+) , 3 were MFC(-) /NGS(-) , 44 were MFC(-) /NGS(+) , and 3 are MFC(+) /NGS(-) . The majority of the MFC(-) /NGS(+) cases occurred within 6 months during the post-treatment phase (64%). Among 44 MFC(-) /NGS(+) instances, 13 had similar NGS profiles to their original day 0 diagnosis. The remaining cases showed preleukemic clonal hematopoiesis mutations, ""likely pathogenic mutations,"" or ""variants of uncertain significance."" CONCLUSION: Our findings show that flow cytometry has its advantages with comparable sensitivity in detecting minimal/measurable residual disease. Next-generation sequencing could be used in an increased and more regular capacity in conjunction with flow cytometry to achieve a more comprehensive surveillance of these patients, resulting in improved outcomes.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['F McGowan, Paul', 'D Hyter, Stephen', 'Cui, Wei', 'Plummer, Regina M', 'Godwin, Andrew K', 'Zhang, Da']","['F McGowan P', 'D Hyter S', 'Cui W', 'Plummer RM', 'Godwin AK', 'Zhang D']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210929,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,,,2021/09/30 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2021/09/29 07:20'],"['2021/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/29 07:20 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13711 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2022 Feb;44(1):118-126. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13711.

Future coculture studies which aim to investigate the impact of bone marrow stromal cells on drug response should take into account that stromal cells have the capacity to phagocytose apoptotic cells.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Herbst, Sophie A', 'Stolarczyk, Marta', 'Becirovic, Tina', 'Czernilofsky, Felix', 'Liu, Yi', 'Kolb, Carolin', 'Knoll, Mareike', 'Herling, Marco', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Dietrich, Sascha']","['Herbst SA', 'Stolarczyk M', 'Becirovic T', 'Czernilofsky F', 'Liu Y', 'Kolb C', 'Knoll M', 'Herling M', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Dietrich S']","['Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf (CIO ABCD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210830,United States,iScience,iScience,101724038,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biological Sciences', 'Cancer', 'Cell Biology', 'Stem Cells Research']",2021/09/30 06:00,2021/09/30 06:01,['2021/09/29 06:59'],"['2021/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/29 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.isci.2021.103062 [doi]', 'S2589-0042(21)01030-0 [pii]']",epublish,iScience. 2021 Aug 30;24(9):103062. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.103062. eCollection 2021 Sep 24.,,,,9,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,PMC8456054,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to significant histological overlap with other tumors of the same family, accurate diagnosis has historically involved combining these results with clinical correlation. Recently, multiple studies have analyzed the role of NKX2.2 immunopositivity in the diagnosis of ES. NKX2.2, a downstream target of the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region-Friend leukemia integration 1 (EWSR1-FLI1) fusion, has been identified as a potential stain to differentiate ES and Ewing-like sarcoma from other small round blue cell tumors. In this study, we examine the histopathological interpretation of five patients. Four cases showed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-identified EWSR1 rearrangement. In one case, rearrangements of EWSR1 or FUS could not be detected, and a diagnosis of Ewing-like sarcoma was rendered. NKX2.2 was immunopositive in all five cases. Based on this limited dataset, NKX2.2 immunopositivity can significantly support the diagnosis of ES and has the potential to support the diagnosis of fusion-undetected Ewing-like sarcoma in appropriate clinical and histologic settings.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Ullah et al.']","['Ullah, Asad', 'Sinkler, Margaret A', 'Velasquez Zarate, Luis', 'Clavijo, Alex', 'White, Joseph']","['Ullah A', 'Sinkler MA', 'Velasquez Zarate L', 'Clavijo A', 'White J']","['Pathology, Medical College of Georgia - Augusta University, Augusta, USA.', 'Orthopedic Surgery, Medical College of Georgia - Augusta University, Augusta, USA.', 'Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, USA.', 'Pathology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA.', 'Pathology, Medical College of Georgia - Augusta University, Augusta, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210823,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['ewing sarcoma', 'ewing-like sarcoma', 'immunostaining', 'nkx2.2', 'small round blue cell']",2021/09/30 06:00,2021/09/30 06:01,['2021/09/29 06:55'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/29 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.17391 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Aug 23;13(8):e17391. doi: 10.7759/cureus.17391. eCollection 2021 Aug.,,,,8,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,PMC8457536,,,,,,,,,,

It is routinely used in children for recurrent blood sampling or intravenous therapies. This study aimed to investigate the complications of port-a-cath insertion in children, the reasons for its removal or reinsertion, and to compare open and percutaneous techniques of insertion in pediatric patients with cancer in the northwest region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods This is a retrospective observational study, which reviews pediatric cases that underwent port-a-cath insertion between 2008 and 2017. Their medical records were assessed for patient characteristics, indications for insertion, the nature of port use, their reasons for removing them, and port-related complications. Results We included 64 patients who had a total of 79 port-a-cath insertions in this study. The median age at first insertion was 38 months (51.56% female, 48.44% male). The mean duration between the first insertion and the removal of the port-a-cath was 36 +/- 17 months. The right internal jugular vein was used in most cases. The rate of complications at our institution was 9.38%. Conclusions In pediatric cancer patients, a port-a-cath can be safely used, is associated with minimal complications, and can be easily managed without serious complications. The most common complications were attributed to infections, followed by the malfunction and obstruction of ports.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Ghmaird et al.']","['Ghmaird, Asmaa S', 'Mohammad Alnoaiji, Mohammad S', 'Alalawi, Yousef S', 'Alrashidi, Tahani N', 'Al Blewi, Sawsan M', 'Gad, Nagwa G', 'Alshahrani, Eid H']","['Ghmaird AS', 'Mohammad Alnoaiji MS', 'Alalawi YS', 'Alrashidi TN', 'Al Blewi SM', 'Gad NG', 'Alshahrani EH']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, SAU.', 'Department of Surgery, King Salman Armed Forces Hospital, Tabuk, SAU.', 'Department of Surgery, King Salman Armed Forces Hospital, Tabuk, SAU.', 'Department of Surgery, King Salman Armed Forces Hospital, Tabuk, SAU.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, SAU.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, SAU.', 'Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Bisha, Bisha, SAU.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210823,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'children', 'complications', 'leukemia', 'malignancy', 'pediatric oncology', 'port-a-cath']",2021/09/30 06:00,2021/09/30 06:01,['2021/09/29 06:55'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/29 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.17379 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Aug 23;13(8):e17379. doi: 10.7759/cureus.17379. eCollection 2021 Aug.,,,,8,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,PMC8457318,,,,,,,,,,

A 62-year-old male patient who had B-ALL (BCR/ABL(+)) for 4 years was diagnosed with relapsed central nervous system leukemia (CNSL). After several courses of high dose methotrexate combined with intrathecal chemotherapy, the patient received murine CD19 CAR-T therapy and achieved complete response (CR). The patient was diagnosed with relapsed CNSL again 15 months after his murine CD19 CAR-T therapy, and was therefore enrolled in the humanized CD19 CAR-T therapy. Subsequently, the present study aimed to compare murine and humanized CD19 CAR-T cells against Nalm-6 cells in vitro and in mice. The patient initially achieved CR from his murine CD19 CAR-T therapy with Grade 1 cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and Grade 1 CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). The patient then achieved CR again from his humanized CD19 CAR-T therapy with Grade 1 CRS and Grade 2 CRES. Peak levels of CD19 CAR-T cells were higher in humanized CD19 CAR-T therapy than those in murine CD19 CAR-T therapy 7 days after infusion in the peripheral blood, in bone marrow and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cytokine levels were higher in humanized CD19 CAR-T therapy than those in murine CD19 CAR-T therapy in the peripheral blood and in CSF. The cytotoxicity to Nalm-6 cells was higher in humanized CD19 CAR-T cells than that in murine CD19 CAR-T cells in vitro. In Nalm-6 BALB/c mice, the median survival time of mice in the murine CD19 CAR-T group was 35 days, while it was 43 days in the humanized CD19 CAR-T group. In conclusion, humanized CD19 CAR-T cell therapy had a better curative effect than that of murine CD19 CAR-T therapy, and may be used as a salvage treatment for recurrent B-ALL after treatment with murine CD19 CAR-T therapy.",['Copyright: (c) Li et al.'],"['Li, Xin', 'Liu, Mei-Jing', 'Mou, Nan', 'Yang, Zhen-Xing', 'Wang, Jia', 'Mu, Juan', 'Zhu, Hai-Bo', 'Deng, Qi']","['Li X', 'Liu MJ', 'Mou N', 'Yang ZX', 'Wang J', 'Mu J', 'Zhu HB', 'Deng Q']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin 300192, P.R.

Defibrotide, the only drug approved in the United States and Europe for treating VOD/SOS post-HCT, has European Commission orphan drug designation for preventing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), associated with endothelial dysfunction. This endothelial cell protector and stabilizing agent restores thrombo-fibrinolytic balance and preserves endothelial homeostasis through antithrombotic, fibrinolytic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-adhesive activity. Defibrotide also preserves endothelial cell structure by inhibiting heparanase activity. Evidence suggests that downregulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) is key to defibrotide's endothelial protective effects; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/AKT) potentially links defibrotide interaction with the endothelial cell membrane and downstream effects. Despite defibrotide's being most extensively studied in VOD/SOS, emerging preclinical and clinical data support defibrotide for treating or preventing other conditions driven by endothelial cell activation, dysfunction, and/or damage, such as GvHD, transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy-associated neurotoxicity, underpinned by cytokine release syndrome and endotheliitis. Further preclinical and clinical studies will explore defibrotide's potential utility in a broader range of disorders resulting from endothelial cell activation and dysfunction.",['(c) 2021.

We developed an adapted European LeukemiaNet (aELN) risk classification based on available genetic data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, to predict post-transplant outcomes in 2289 adult AML patients transplanted in first remission, between 2013 and 2017. Patients were stratified according to aELN into three groups: favorable (Fav, N = 181), intermediate (IM, N = 1185), and adverse (Adv, N = 923). Univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences in 2-year overall survival (OS) (Fav: 67.7%, IM: 64.9% and Adv: 53.9%; p < 0.001); disease-free survival (DFS) (Fav: 57.8%, IM: 55.5% and Adv: 45.3; p < 0.001) and relapse (Fav: 28%, IM: 27.5% and Adv: 37.5%; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis (MVA) revealed no differences in outcomes between the Fav and IM groups, thus they were combined. On MVA, patients in the Adv risk group had the highest risk of relapse (HR 1.47 p </= 0.001) and inferior DFS (HR 1.35 p < 0.001) and OS (HR 1.39 p < 0.001), even using myeloablative conditioning or in those without the pre-HCT measurable-residual disease.

New next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have emerged as a highly sensitive and specific method to detect MRD. In addition to defining the role of post-HCT MRD monitoring in FLT3-ITD mutated AML, there is great interest in the optimal use of oral FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FLT3 inhibitors) to maintain remission following HCT. In this study, we evaluated the clinical impact of sensitive FLT3 MRD testing early after HCT and maintenance FLT3 inhibitor use at our transplant center. We found that there was a trend towards inferior progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with early post-HCT MRD, but that overall survival (OS) was not significantly impacted by MRD. The use of maintenance FLT3 inhibitors led to a significantly superior PFS and OS in our cohort, and improved PFS and OS in both MRD-negative and MRD-positive patients. Altogether, our results demonstrate the prognostic significance of NGS-based MRD monitoring for FLT3-ITD and the ability of post-HCT maintenance therapy to prevent relapse and death in FLT3-ITD mutated AML.","['(c) 2021.

The bone marrow microenvironment harbors treatment-resistant myeloma cells, which eventually lead to disease relapse in patients. In the bone marrow, CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are highly abundant amongst CD4(+) T cells providing an immune protective niche for different long-living cell populations, e.g., hematopoietic stem cells. Here, we addressed the functional role of Tregs in multiple myeloma dissemination to bone marrow compartments and disease progression. To investigate the immune regulation of multiple myeloma, we utilized syngeneic immunocompetent murine multiple myeloma models in two different genetic backgrounds. Analyzing the spatial immune architecture of multiple myeloma revealed that the bone marrow Tregs accumulated in the vicinity of malignant plasma cells and displayed an activated phenotype. In vivo Treg depletion prevented multiple myeloma dissemination in both models. Importantly, short-term in vivo depletion of Tregs in mice with established multiple myeloma evoked a potent CD8 T cell- and NK cell-mediated immune response resulting in complete and stable remission. Conclusively, this preclinical in-vivo study suggests that Tregs are an attractive target for the treatment of multiple myeloma.",['(c) 2021.

To elucidate the circulating lymphocyte phenotype and systemic effects during anti-PD1 1st-line HL treatment we applied multicolor flow cytometry, FluoroSpot and NanoString to sequential samples of 81 HL patients from the NIVAHL trial (NCT03004833) compared to healthy controls. HL patients showed a decreased CD4 T-cell fraction, a higher percentage of effector-memory T cells and higher expression of activation markers at baseline. Strikingly, and in contrast to solid cancers, expression for 10 out of 16 analyzed co-inhibitory molecules on T cells (e.g., PD1, LAG3, Tim3) was higher in HL. Overall, we observed a sustained decrease of the exhausted T-cell phenotype during anti-PD1 treatment. FluoroSpot of 42.3% of patients revealed T-cell responses against >/=1 of five analyzed tumor-associated antigens. Importantly, these responses were more frequently observed in samples from patients with early excellent response to anti-PD1 therapy. In summary, an initially exhausted lymphocyte phenotype rapidly reverted during anti-PD1 1st-line treatment.

Overexpression of EVI1 is found in a subgroup of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 3q26 chromosomal rearrangements, which is often therapy resistant. In AMLs harboring a t(3;8)(q26;q24), we observed the translocation of a MYC super-enhancer (MYC SE) to the EVI1 locus. We generated an in vitro model mimicking a patient-based t(3;8)(q26;q24) using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and demonstrated hyperactivation of EVI1 by the hijacked MYC SE. This MYC SE contains multiple enhancer modules, of which only one recruits transcription factors active in early hematopoiesis. This enhancer module is critical for EVI1 overexpression as well as enhancer-promoter interaction. Multiple CTCF binding regions in the MYC SE facilitate this enhancer-promoter interaction, which also involves a CTCF binding site upstream of the EVI1 promoter.

Dysregulation of PRMT5 is associated with clinical features of several cancers, including lymphomas, lung cancer, and breast cancer. Here, we describe the characterization of JNJ-64619178, a novel, selective, and potent PRMT5 inhibitor, currently in clinical trials for patients with advanced solid tumors, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. JNJ-64619178 demonstrated a prolonged inhibition of PRMT5 and potent antiproliferative activity in subsets of cancer cell lines derived from various histologies, including lung, breast, pancreatic, and hematological malignancies. In primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples, the presence of splicing factor mutations correlated with a higher ex vivo sensitivity to JNJ-64619178. Furthermore, the potent and unique mechanism of inhibition of JNJ-64619178, combined with highly optimized pharmacological properties, led to efficient tumor growth inhibition and regression in several xenograft models in vivo, with once-daily or intermittent oral-dosing schedules. An increase in splicing burden was observed upon JNJ-64619178 treatment. Overall, these observations support the continued clinical evaluation of JNJ-64619178 in patients with aberrant PRMT5 activity-driven tumors.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Brehmer, Dirk', 'Beke, Lijs', 'Wu, Tongfei', 'Millar, Hillary J', 'Moy, Christopher', 'Sun, Weimei', 'Mannens, Geert', 'Pande, Vineet', 'Boeckx, An', 'van Heerde, Erika', 'Nys, Thomas', 'Gustin, Emmanuel M', 'Verbist, Bie', 'Zhou, Longen', 'Fan, Yue', 'Bhargava, Vipul', 'Safabakhsh, Pegah', 'Vinken, Petra', 'Verhulst, Tinne', 'Gilbert, Angelique', 'Rai, Sumit', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'Pastore, Friederike', 'Fiore, Danilo', 'Gu, Junchen', 'Johnson, Amy', 'Philippar, Ulrike', 'Morschhauser, Barbara', 'Walker, David', 'De Lange, Desiree', 'Keersmaekers, Vikki', 'Viellevoye, Marcel', 'Diels, Gaston', 'Schepens, Wim', 'Thuring, Jan Willem', 'Meerpoel, Lieven', 'Packman, Kathryn', 'Lorenzi, Matthew V', 'Laquerre, Sylvie']","['Brehmer D', 'Beke L', 'Wu T', 'Millar HJ', 'Moy C', 'Sun W', 'Mannens G', 'Pande V', 'Boeckx A', 'van Heerde E', 'Nys T', 'Gustin EM', 'Verbist B', 'Zhou L', 'Fan Y', 'Bhargava V', 'Safabakhsh P', 'Vinken P', 'Verhulst T', 'Gilbert A', 'Rai S', 'Graubert TA', 'Pastore F', 'Fiore D', 'Gu J', 'Johnson A', 'Philippar U', 'Morschhauser B', 'Walker D', 'De Lange D', 'Keersmaekers V', 'Viellevoye M', 'Diels G', 'Schepens W', 'Thuring JW', 'Meerpoel L', 'Packman K', 'Lorenzi MV', 'Laquerre S']","['Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Shanghai, China.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Shanghai, China.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania. slaquerr@its.jnj.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20210928,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,,,2021/09/30 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2021/09/29 06:02'],"['2021/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/29 06:02 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-21-0367 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0367 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Dec;20(12):2317-2328. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0367.

However, the application and effect of CAR-T therapy in B-ALL patients with extramedullary relapse are rarely issued even disqualified in some clinical trials. Here, we examined the efficacy of 19CAR-T in patients with both bone marrow and extramedullary involvement. Materials and Methods: CAR-T cells were generated by transfection of primary human T lymphocytes with a lentiviral vector expressing anti-CD19 single chain antibody fragments (scFvs) with the cytoplasmic domains of 4-1BB and CD3zeta, and used to infuse patients diagnosed as having r/r B-ALL with extramedullary origination. Clinical responses were evaluated by the use of bone marrow aspiration, imaging, and flow cytometry. Results: Eight patients received 19CAR-T infusion and all attained complete remission (CR). Only one patient was bridged to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although three patients relapsed after infusion, they received 19/22CAR-T infusion sequentially and attained a second remission. To date, five patients are in continuous CR and all eight patients are still alive. The mean follow-up time was 21.9 months, while the 24-month estimated event-free survival is 51.4%. Conclusion: Anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy can lead to clinical remission for extramedullary relapsed pediatric B-ALL patients. However, the problem of CD19+ relapses after CAR-T remained to be solved. For patients relapsing after CAR-T, a second CAR-T therapy creates another opportunity for remission for subsequent HSCT.",,"['Wan, Xinyu', 'Yang, Xiaomin', 'Yang, Fan', 'Wang, Tianyi', 'Ding, Lixia', 'Song, Lili', 'Miao, Yan', 'Wang, Xiang', 'Ma, Yani', 'Luo, Chengjuan', 'Tang, Jingyan', 'Gu, Longjun', 'Chen, Jing', 'Tang, Yanjing', 'Lu, Jun', 'Li, Benshang']","['Wan X', 'Yang X', 'Yang F', 'Wang T', 'Ding L', 'Song L', 'Miao Y', 'Wang X', 'Ma Y', 'Luo C', 'Tang J', 'Gu L', 'Chen J', 'Tang Y', 'Lu J', 'Li B']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210917,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'CD19 CAR-T', 'extramedullary relapse', 'second CAR-T']",2021/09/30 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2021/09/29 00:14'],"['2021/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/29 00:14 [entrez]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['crt.2021.399 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2021.399 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Sep 17. pii: crt.2021.399. doi: 10.4143/crt.2021.399.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, our human case-control study firstly showed that there was a positive association of Parkin mitochondrial translocation, MCL-1 reduction, placental apoptosis, and all-cause FGR. Subsequently, Cd was administered to establish in vitro and in vivo models of placental apoptosis or FGR. Our models demonstrated that Parkin mitochondrial translocation was observed in Cd-administrated placental trophoblasts. Meaningfully, Parkin siRNA (siR) dramatically mitigated Cd-triggered apoptosis in placental trophoblasts. Mdivi-1 (M-1), an inhibitor for Parkin mitochondrial translocation, mitigated Cd-induced apoptosis in placental trophoblasts, which further ameliorated the effect of attenuated placental sizes in Cd-exposed mice. Furthermore, the interaction of MCL-1 with Parkin or Ub in Cd-stimulated cells was stronger than that in controls. MG132, an inhibitor for proteasome, abolished MCL-1 degradation in Cd-stimulated cells. Importantly, Parkin siR and M-1 memorably abolished the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of MCL-1 in placental trophoblasts. Interestingly, mito-TEMPO and melatonin, two mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, obviously rescued Cd-caused mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decrease, Parkin mitochondrial translocation, MCL-1 degradation, and apoptosis in placental trophoblasts. In conclusion, cadmium induces placental apoptosis and FGR via mtROS-mediated Parkin-modulated degradation of MCL-1.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

MLL1 is a molecular dependency in NUP98-fusion leukemia, and therefore we investigated the efficacy of therapeutic blockade of the Menin-MLL1 interaction in NUP98-fusion leukemia models. Using mouse leukemia cell lines driven by NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-JARID1A fusion oncoproteins, we demonstrate that NUP98-fusion driven leukemia is sensitive to the Menin-MLL1 inhibitor VTP50469, with an IC50 similar to what we have previously reported for MLL-rearranged and NPM1c leukemia cells. Menin-MLL1 inhibition upregulates markers of differentiation such as CD11b and downregulates expression of pro-leukemogenic transcription factors such as Meis1 in NUP98-fusion transformed leukemia cells. We demonstrate that MLL1 and the NUP98 fusion protein itself are evicted from chromatin at a critical set of genes that are essential for maintenance of the malignant phenotype. In addition to these in vitro studies, we established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NUP98-fusion driven AML to test the in vivo efficacy of Menin-MLL1 inhibition. Treatment with VTP50469 significantly prolongs survival of mice engrafted with NUP98-NSD1 and NUP98-JARID1A leukemias. Gene expression analysis revealed that Menin-MLL1 inhibition simultaneously suppresses a pro-leukemogenic gene expression program, including downregulation of the HOXA cluster, and upregulates tissue-specific markers of differentiation. These preclinical results suggest that Menin-MLL1 inhibition may represent a rational, targeted therapy for patients with NUP98-rearranged leukemias.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Heikamp, Emily B', 'Henrich, Jill A', 'Perner, Florian', 'Wong, Eric M', 'Hatton, Charles', 'Wen, Yanhe', 'Barwe, Sonali P', 'Gopalakrishnapillai, Anilkumar', 'Xu, Haiming', 'Uckelmann, Hannah Julia', 'Takao, Sumiko', 'Kazansky, Yaniv', 'Pikman, Yana', 'McGeehan, Gerard M', 'Kolb, Edward A', 'Kentsis, Alex', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Heikamp EB', 'Henrich JA', 'Perner F', 'Wong EM', 'Hatton C', 'Wen Y', 'Barwe SP', 'Gopalakrishnapillai A', 'Xu H', 'Uckelmann HJ', 'Takao S', 'Kazansky Y', 'Pikman Y', 'McGeehan GM', 'Kolb EA', 'Kentsis A', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, United States."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware, United States.', 'Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware, United States.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, United States.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Nemours Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Wilmington, Delaware, United States.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, United States.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210928,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/09/29 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2021/09/28 17:28'],"['2021/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/28 17:28 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01654-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021012806 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Sep 28. pii: S0006-4971(21)01654-2. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021012806.,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4591-4477', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7145-6038', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9903-4291', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4162-3004', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3467-5703', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5336-0216']","['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA235285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA243124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From the cancer registries of Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, we identified 3765 five-year survivors of ALL, diagnosed before age 20 during 1971-2008. For each survivor, up to five matched comparison subjects were randomly selected from the general population (n = 18,323). Causes of death were classified as relapse related, health related, and external. Late mortality was evaluated by cumulative incidences of death from 5-year survival date. Mortality hazard ratios (HR) were evaluated with Cox proportional models. RESULTS: Among the survivors, 315 deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 16 years from 5-year survival date (range 0-42). The majority were attributable to relapse (n = 224), followed by second neoplasm (n = 45). Cumulative incidence of all-cause late mortality at 15 years from diagnosis decreased gradually over treatment decades, from 14.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.6-17.2) for survivors diagnosed during 1971-1981, to 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3-3.7) for those diagnosed during 2002-2008. This was mainly attributable to a reduction in relapse-related deaths decreasing from 13.4% (95% CI: 10.7-16.1) for survivors diagnosed during 1971-1981 to 1.9% (95% CI: 0.9-2.8) for those diagnosed during 2002-2008. Health-related late mortality was low and did not change substantially across treatment decades. Compared to comparison subjects, all-cause mortality HR was 40 (95% CI: 26-61) 5-9 years from diagnosis, and 4.4 (95% CI: 3.4-5.6) >/=10 years from diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of ALL have higher late mortality than population comparison subjects.

The increasingly recognized relevance of epigenetic changes in cancer immunology prompted us to determine the impact of the DNA methylation profiles of CART19 cells on the clinical course. METHODS: We recruited 114 patients with B-cell malignancies, comprising 77 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 37 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients, who were treated with CART19 cells. Using a comprehensive DNA methylation microarray, we determined the epigenomic changes that occur in the patient T-cells upon transduction of the CAR vector. The effects of the identified DNA methylation sites on clinical response, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: We identified 984 genomic sites with differential DNA methylation between CAR-untransduced and CAR-transduced T-cells before infusion into the patient. Eighteen of these distinct epigenetic loci were associated with complete response (CR) adjusting by multiple testing. Using the sites linked to CR, the EPICART signature was established in the initial discovery cohort (n = 79), which was associated with CR (Fisher's exact test, P<.001) and enhanced EFS (HR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.70, P=.002; log-rank P=.003) and OS (HR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.20 to 0.99, P=.047; log-rank P=.04;). Most important the EPICART profile maintained its clinical course predictive value in the validation cohort (n = 35) where it was associated with CR (Fisher's exact test, P<.001) and enhanced OS (HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.84, P=.02; log-rank P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: We show that the DNA methylation landscape of patient CART19 cells influences the efficacy of the cellular immunotherapy treatment in patients with B-cell malignancy.",['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Here, we describe such a novel bilineal event discovered in an adult woman with B-lymphoblastic leukemia (BLL). At the time of BLL diagnosis, the patient had a normal karyotype and a bulk sequencing panel identified pathogenic variants in BCOR, EZH2, RUNX1, and U2AF1, a genotype more typical of myeloid neoplasia. Additionally, the patient was noted to have 3-year history of cytopenias, and morphologic dyspoiesis was noted on post-treatment samples, raising the possibility of an antecedent hematologic disorder. To investigate the clonal architecture of her disease, we performed targeted sequencing on fractionated samples enriched for either B-lymphoblasts or circulating granulocytes. These studies revealed a truncal founder mutation in the spliceosome gene U2AF1 in both fractions, while distinct secondary mutations were present only in B-lymphoblasts (BCOR, NRAS) or myeloid cells (ASXL1, EZH2, RUNX1). These results indicate that both processes evolved from a common U2AF1-mutated precursor, which then acquired additional mutations during a process of divergent evolution and bilineal differentiation. Our findings highlight an atypical mechanism of BLL leukemogenesis and demonstrate the potential utility of fractionated sequencing in the characterization of acute leukemia.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Despite improvements in the therapeutic options for patients with MF, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment. We previously demonstrated multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms in patients with MF, including increased expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on T cells compared with healthy controls. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase 2, single-arm study of pembrolizumab in patients with Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System category of intermediate-2 or greater primary, post-essential thrombocythemia or post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis that were ineligible for or were previously treated with ruxolitinib. The study followed a Simon 2-stage design and enrolled a total of 10 patients, 5 of whom had JAK2V617mutation, 2 had CALR mutation, and 6 had additional mutations. Most patients were previously treated with ruxolitinib. Pembrolizumab treatment was well tolerated, but there were no objective clinical responses, so the study closed after the first stage was completed. However, immune profiling by flow cytometry, T-cell receptor sequencing, and plasma proteomics demonstrated changes in the immune milieu of patients, which suggested improved T-cell responses that can potentially favor antitumor immunity. The fact that these changes were not reflected in a clinical response strongly suggests that combination immunotherapeutic approaches rather than monotherapy may be necessary to reverse the multifactorial mechanisms of immune suppression in myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Primary objectives were to determine the safety and identify maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib was given at two dose levels (DL) of 5 and 10mg twice daily, with fludarabine/melphalan conditioning regimen and tacrolimus/sirolimus GVHD prophylaxis. We enrolled 6 and 12 patients in DL-1 and DL-2, respectively. Median age at transplant was 65 years (range:25-73) for all patients. Per DIPSS, 4 patients were at high and 14 were at intermediate risk. PBSCs was the graft source from a matched sibling (n=5) or unrelated (n=13) donor. At each DL one patient developed DLTs: Grade 3 cardiac and GI with Grade 4 pulmonary in DL-1 and Grade 3 kidney injury in DL-2. All patients achieved engraftment. Cumulative incidence (CI) of acute GVHD grade 2-4 and 3-4 were 17% (95% CI: 6-47) and 11% (95% CI: 3-41), respectively. CI of 1-year chronic GVHD was 42% (95% CI: 24-74). With the median follow-up of 22.6 months (range:6.2-25.8) in surviving patients the 1-year overall and progression free survival were 77% (95% CI: 50-91) and 71% (95% CI: 44-87), respectively. Causes of death (n=4) were cardiac arrest, GVHD, respiratory failure, and refractory GVHD of liver. Our results showed that peri-HCT ruxolitinib was safe and well-tolerated with the MTD determined as 10 mg BID, associated with dose-dependent PK and cytokine profile.

We report results of a phase 1b dose-escalation study of the novel, subcutaneous BET inhibitor RO6870810 (RO) combined with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, and rituximab, in recurrent/refractory DLBCL. RO was delivered for 14 days of a 21-day cycle, whereas venetoclax was delivered continuously. A 3 + 3 escalation design was used to determine the safety of the RO+venetoclax doublet; rituximab was added in later cohorts. Thirty-nine patients were treated with a median of 2.8 cycles (range, 1-11). Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 febrile neutropenia, grade 4 diarrhea, and hypomagnesemia for the doublet; and grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia and grade 4 diarrhea when rituximab was added. The doublet maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 0.65 mg/kg RO+600 mg venetoclax; for RO+venetoclax+rituximab, the MTDs were 0.45 mg/kg, 600 mg, and 375 mg/m2, respectively. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia (28%) and anemia and thrombocytopenia (23% each). Responses were seen in all cohorts and molecular subtypes. Sustained decreases in CD11b on monocytes indicated pharmacodynamic activity of RO. Overall response rate according to modified Lugano criteria was 38.5%; 48% of responses lasted for >/=180 days. Complete response was observed in 8 patients (20.5%). Optimization of the treatment schedule and a better understanding of predictors of response would be needed to support broader clinical use.

The array-based international consensus definition of DNA methylation has recently classified patients with JMML into the following 3 groups: high (HM), intermediate (IM), and low methylation (LM). To develop a simple and robust methylation clinical test, 137 patients with JMML were analyzed using the Digital Restriction Enzyme Analysis of Methylation (DREAM), which is a next-generation sequencing-based methylation analysis. Unsupervised consensus clustering of the discovery cohort (n = 99) using DREAM data identified HM (HM_DREAM; n = 35) and LM subgroups (LM_DREAM; n = 64). Of the 98 cases that could be compared with the international consensus classification, 90 HM (n = 30) and LM (n = 60) cases had 100% concordance with DREAM clustering results. Of the remaining 8 cases comprising the IM group, 4 were classified as belonging to the HM_DREAM group and 4 to the LM_DREAM group. A machine-learning classifier was successfully constructed using a support vector machine (SVM), which divided the validation cohort (n = 38) into HM (HM_SVM, n = 18) and LM (LM_SVM; n = 20) groups. Patients with the HM_SVM profile had a significantly poorer 5-year overall survival rate than those with the LM_SVM profile. In conclusion, we developed a robust methylation test using DREAM for patients with JMML. This simple and straightforward test can be easily incorporated into diagnosis to generate a methylation classification for patients so they can receive risk-adapted treatment in the context of future clinical trials.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, it is difficult to directly target oncogenic RAS proteins for therapeutic intervention. We have developed a Drosophila acute myeloid leukemia model induced by human KRASG12V, which exhibits a dramatic increase in myeloid-like leukemia cells. We performed both genetic and drug screens using this model. The genetic screen identified 24 candidate genes able to attenuate the oncogenic RAS-induced phenotype, including two key hypoxia pathway genes HIF1A and ARNT (HIF1B). The drug screen revealed that echinomycin, an inhibitor of HIF1A, can effectively attenuate the leukemia phenotype caused by KRASG12V. Furthermore, we showed that echinomycin treatment can effectively suppress oncogenic RAS-driven leukemia cell proliferation, using both human leukemia cell lines and a mouse xenograft model. These data suggest that inhibiting the hypoxia pathway could be an effective treatment approach and that echinomycin is a promising targeted drug to attenuate oncogenic RAS-induced cancer phenotypes.

One way to avoid this would be to use a drug delivery system decorated with targeting moieties, such as an aptamer, if a targeted aptamer is available. In this study, aptamers were selected against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressing the MLL-AF9 oncogene through systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Twelve rounds of SELEX, including two counter selections against fibroblast cells, were completed. Aptamer pools were sequenced, and three candidate sequences were identified. These sequences consisted of two 23-base primer regions flanking a 30-base central domain. Binding studies were performed using flow cytometry, and the lead sequence had a binding constant of 37.5 + / - 2.5 nM to AML cells, while displaying no binding to fibroblast or umbilical cord blood cells at 200 nM. A truncation study of the lead sequence was done using nine shortened sequences, and showed the 5' primer was not important for binding. The lead sequence was tested against seven AML patient cultures, and five cultures showed binding at 200 nM. In summary, a DNA aptamer specific to AML cells was developed and characterized for future drug-aptamer conjugates.",['(c) 2021.

Clinic-close, individualized molecular model systems are required for functional validation and to identify therapeutic targets of high significance for each patient. Here, we establish a Cre-ER(T2)-loxP (causes recombination, estrogen receptor mutant T2, locus of X-over P1) based inducible RNAi- (ribonucleic acid interference) mediated gene silencing system in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acute leukemias in vivo. Mimicking anti-cancer therapy in patients, gene inhibition is initiated in mice harboring orthotopic tumors. In fluorochrome guided, competitive in vivo trials, silencing of the apoptosis regulator MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) correlates to pharmacological MCL1 inhibition in patients tumors, demonstrating the ability of the method to detect therapeutic vulnerabilities. The technique identifies a major tumor-maintaining potency of the MLL-AF4 (mixed lineage leukemia, ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 4) fusion, restricted to samples carrying the translocation. DUX4 (double homeobox 4) plays an essential role in patients' leukemias carrying the recently described DUX4-IGH (immunoglobulin heavy chain) translocation, while the downstream mediator DDIT4L (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 like) is identified as therapeutic vulnerability. By individualizing functional genomics in established tumors in vivo, our technique decisively complements the value chain of precision oncology.

Several in vitro systems have been established to culture patient-derived HSPCs in specific microenvironments, but they do not fully recapitulate the complex features of native bone marrow. Our group previously reported that human osteoblastic BM niches (O-N), engineered by culturing mesenchymal stromal cells within three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds under perfusion flow in a bioreactor system, are capable of maintaining, expanding, and functionally regulating healthy human cord blood-derived HSPCs. Here, we first demonstrate that this 3D O-N can sustain malignant CD34(+) cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloproliferative neoplasm patients for up to 3 wk. Human malignant cells distributed in the bioreactor system mimicking the spatial distribution found in native BM tissue, where most HSPCs remain linked to the niches and mature cells are released to the circulation. Using human adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction cells, we then generated a stromal-vascular niche and demonstrated that O-N and stromal-vascular niche differentially regulate leukemic UCSD-AML1 cell expansion, immunophenotype, and response to chemotherapy. The developed system offers a unique platform to investigate human leukemogenesis and response to drugs in customized environments, mimicking defined features of native hematopoietic niches and compatible with the establishment of personalized settings.",,"['Garcia-Garcia, Andres', 'Klein, Thibaut', 'Born, Gordian', 'Hilpert, Morgane', 'Scherberich, Arnaud', 'Lengerke, Claudia', 'Skoda, Radek C', 'Bourgine, Paul E', 'Martin, Ivan']","['Garcia-Garcia A', 'Klein T', 'Born G', 'Hilpert M', 'Scherberich A', 'Lengerke C', 'Skoda RC', 'Bourgine PE', 'Martin I']","['Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland; andres.garcia-garcia@unibas.ch ivan.martin@usb.ch.', 'Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Technologies for Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Basel, 4123 Allschwil, Switzerland.', 'Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Technologies for Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Basel, 4123 Allschwil, Switzerland.', 'Stem Cells and Hematopoiesis, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Experimental Hematology, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory for Cell, Tissue, and Organ Engineering, Department of Clinical Sciences, Wallenberg Center for Molecular Medicine, Lund University, 22100 Lund, Sweden.', 'Stem Cell Center, Lund University, 221 00 Lund, Sweden.', 'Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland; andres.garcia-garcia@unibas.ch ivan.martin@usb.ch.', 'Technologies for Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Basel, 4123 Allschwil, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*3D perfusion bioreactors', '*AML/MPN', '*engineering stem cell niches', '*osteoblastic niche', '*stromal-vascular niche']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/09/28 05:51'],"['2021/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/27 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/09/28 05:51 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2114227118 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2114227118 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Oct 5;118(40). pii: 2114227118. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2114227118.,20211214,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']","['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche/*physiology', 'Stromal Vascular Fraction/metabolism', 'Tissue Scaffolds/chemistry', 'Tumor Microenvironment/physiology']",40,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8797-649X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3468-6955', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7639-6844', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6493-0432']",,PMC8501773,,,['2022/03/27 00:00'],,,,,,,

The CD47 ""don't eat me signal"" is upregulated on LSCs and contributes to immune evasion by inhibiting phagocytosis through interacting with myeloid-specific signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha). Activation of macrophages by blocking CD47 has been successful, but the ubiquitous expression of CD47 on healthy cells poses potential limitations for such therapies. In contrast, CD123 is a well-known LSC-specific surface marker utilized as a therapeutic target. Here, we report the development of SIRPalpha-alphaCD123 fusion antibodies that localize the disruption of CD47/SIRPalpha signalling to AML while specifically enhancing LSC clearance. METHODS: SIRPalpha-alphaCD123 antibodies were generated by fusing the extracellular domain of SIRPalpha to an alphaCD123 antibody. The binding properties of the antibodies were analysed by flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance. The functional characteristics of the fusion antibodies were determined by antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays using primary AML patient cells. Finally, an in vivo engraftment assay was utilized to assess LSC targeting. RESULTS: SIRPalpha-alphaCD123 fusion antibodies exhibited increased binding and preferential targeting of CD123(+) CD47(+) AML cells even in the presence of CD47(+) healthy cells. Furthermore, SIRPalpha-alphaCD123 fusion antibodies confined disruption of the CD47-SIRPalpha axis locally to AML cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that SIRPalpha-alphaCD123 antibodies greatly enhanced AML cell phagocytosis mediated by allogeneic and autologous macrophages. Moreover, SIRPalpha-alphaCD123 fusion antibodies efficiently targeted LSCs with in vivo engraftment potential.

However, the mechanism by which ferroptosis modulates acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of ferroptosis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in AML and establish a corresponding prognostic model. METHODS: RNA-sequencing data and clinicopathological characteristics were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and ferroptosis-related genes were obtained from the FerrDb database. The ""limma"" R package, Cox regression, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used to determine the ferroptosis-related lncRNA signature with the lowest Akaike information criteria (AIC). The risk score of ferroptosis-related lncRNAs was calculated and patients with AML were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the median risk score. The Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the risk score. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were performed to explore the biological functions of the ferroptosis-related lncRNAs. RESULTS: Seven ferroptosis-related lncRNA signatures were identified in the training group, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses confirmed that risk scores were independent prognostic predictors of AML in both the training and validation groups (All P < 0.05). In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) analysis confirmed that the signatures had a good predictive ability for the prognosis of AML. GSEA and ssGSEA showed that the seven ferroptosis-related lncRNAs were related to glutathione metabolism and tumor immunity. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, seven novel ferroptosis-related lncRNA signatures (AP001266.2, AC133961.1, AF064858.3, AC007383.2, AC008906.1, AC026771.1, and KIF26B-AS1) were established. These signatures were shown to accurately predict the prognosis of AML, which would provide new insights into strategies for the development of new AML therapies.",['(c) 2021.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 34-year-old woman diagnosed with AML-M4 who achieved remission after chemotherapy and received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for consolidation. Her past medical history showed that she received bilateral breast implants 7 years ago. This patient underwent ultrasound examination of the breast and multiple bilateral breast nodules were revealed that were not considered by clinicians to be concerning. Several months later, the patient's bilateral nodules rapidly progressed to large palpable masses. Ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed diffuse infiltration of undifferentiated tumor cells and immunohistochemistry (IHC) indicated that the tumor was positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO), cluster of differentiation (CD) 34, CD43, CD68, CD117, and Ki67. The pathological diagnosis was extramedullary recurrence of AML as MS of breast. After the diagnosis, the patient received systemic chemotherapy and drugs containing cytarabine, azacitidine, and methotrexate. However, 1 year after achieving partial remission, the patient died from intracranial invasion of leukemia, brain herniation, and respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: It is necessary for the specialist to have a high suspicion index by careful inquiry of the patient's medical history if a patient presents at the breast clinic with a breast tumor as the chief complaint. Combining information from the patient's medical history with a tumor biopsy is critical for obtaining the correct diagnosis of the disease.",['(c) 2021.

These side effects are experienced by patients and parents as detrimental with respect to health related quality of life (HRQoL). Based on previous studies, it has been suggested that neurobehavioral side effects are associated to cortisol depletion of the mineralocorticoid receptor in the brain. Our previously reported randomized controlled trial, the Dexadagen study (NTR3280), suggests that physiological hydrocortisone addition during dexamethasone treatment may overcome clinically relevant neurobehavioral problems in patients who experience these problems during dexamethasone treatment. With our current study, we aim to replicate these results in a targeted larger sample before further implementing this intervention into standard of care. METHODS: In a national center setting, pediatric ALL patients between 3 and 18 years are enrolled in an Identification study, which identifies patients with clinically relevant dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral side effects using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Contributing factors, such as genetic susceptibility, dexamethasone pharmacokinetics as well as psychosocial and family factors are studied to determine their influence in the inter-patient variability for developing dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral side effects. Patients with clinically relevant problems (i.e. a rise of >/= 5 points on the SDQ Total Difficulties Score after 5 days of dexamethasone) are subsequently included in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a cross-over design. They receive two courses placebo followed by two courses hydrocortisone during dexamethasone treatment, or vice versa, each time at least 16 days without study medication in between. The primary endpoint is change in SDQ score. The secondary endpoints are sleep (measured with actigraphy and the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children) and HRQoL (Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire). DISCUSSION: The results of our current study may contribute to the management of future ALL patients who experience dexamethasone-induced neuropsychological problems as it may improve HRQoL for patients who suffer most from dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral side effects. Furthermore, by investigating multiple risk factors that could be related to inter-patient variability in developing these side effects, we might be able to identify and treat patients who are at risk earlier during treatment.

These strains and subspecies carry infectious and endogenous mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs) that can be pathogenic and mutagenic. MLVs evolved in concert with restrictive host factors with some under positive selection, including the XPR1 receptor for xenotropic/polytropic MLVs (X/P-MLVs) and the post-entry restriction factor Fv1. Since positive selection marks host-pathogen genetic conflicts, we examined MLVs for counter-adaptations at sites that interact with XPR1, Fv1, and the CAT1 receptor for ecotropic MLVs (E-MLVs). Results describe different co-adaptive evolutionary paths within the ranges occupied by these virus-infected subspecies. The interface of CAT1, and the otherwise variable E-MLV envelopes, is highly conserved; antiviral protection is afforded by the Fv4 restriction factor. XPR1 and X/P-MLVs variants show coordinate geographic distributions, with receptor critical sites in envelope, under positive selection but with little variation in envelope and XPR1 in mice carrying P-ERVs.

Different transmission modes have been described, such as breastfeeding, and, as for other blood-borne pathogens, unsafe sexual activity, intravenous drug usage, and blood transfusion and transplantation. The present systematic review was conducted to identify all peer-reviewed studies concerning the work-related infection by HTLV-1/2. A literature search was conducted from January to May 2021, according to the PRISMA methodology, selecting 29 studies: seven related to health care workers (HCWs), five to non-HCWs, and 17 to sex workers (SWs). The findings showed no clear evidence as to the possibility of HTLV-1/2 occupational transmission in HCWs, according to the limited number and quality of the papers. Moreover, non-HCWs showed a higher prevalence in jobs consistent with a lower socioeconomic status or that could represent a familial cluster, and an increased risk of zoonotic transmission from STLV-1-infected non-human primates has been observed in African hunters. Finally, a general increase of HTLV-1 infection was observed in SWs, whereas only one paper described an increased prevalence for HTLV-2, supporting the urgent need for prevention and control measures, including screening, diagnosis, and treatment of HTLV-1/2, to be offered routinely as part of a comprehensive approach to decrease the impact of sexually transmitted diseases in SWs.",,"['Stufano, Angela', 'Jahantigh, Hamid Reza', 'Cagnazzo, Francesco', 'Centrone, Francesca', 'Loconsole, Daniela', 'Chironna, Maria', 'Lovreglio, Piero']","['Stufano A', 'Jahantigh HR', 'Cagnazzo F', 'Centrone F', 'Loconsole D', 'Chironna M', 'Lovreglio P']","['Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine-Section of Occupational Medicine, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine-Section of Occupational Medicine, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine-Section of Occupational Medicine, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology-Hygiene Section, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology-Hygiene Section, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology-Hygiene Section, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine-Section of Occupational Medicine, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210902,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV infection', 'STLV-1 zoonotic transmission', 'blood borne pathogens', 'health care workers', 'occupational risk', 'sex workers']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2021/09/28 01:26'],"['2021/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:26 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['v13091753 [pii]', '10.3390/v13091753 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2021 Sep 2;13(9). pii: v13091753. doi: 10.3390/v13091753.,,,,9,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9101-7742', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0482-7510', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3018-5408', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2057-9745', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1043-1256', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1609-9397']",,PMC8472817,,,,,,,,,,

This is partly due to the lack of clinical presentation during the early stages of primary infection and the elusive nature of BLV transmission. This study sought to validate a near-complete genomic sequencing approach for reliability and accuracy before determining its efficacy in characterizing the sequence identity of BLV proviral genomes collected from a pilot study made up of 14 animals from one commercial dairy herd. These BLV-infected animals were comprised of seven adult dam/daughter pairs that tested positive by ELISA and qPCR. The results demonstrate sequence identity or divergence of the BLV genome from the same samples tested in two independent laboratories, suggesting both vertical and horizontal transmission in this dairy herd.

A major breakthrough in the armamentarium of anti-cancer agents has been the introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), able to inhibit aberrantly activated pathways and/or to unleash antigen (Ag)-specific immune responses. Nonetheless, mAb-mediated targeted pressure often fails due to escape mechanisms, mainly Ag loss/downregulation, ultimately providing therapy resistance. Hence, in order to target multiple Ag at the same time, and to facilitate cancer-immune cells interactions, bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have been developed and are being tested in clinical trials, yielding variable safety/efficacy results based on target selection and their structure. While in hematologic cancers the bsAb blinatumomab recently reached the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval for B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, bsAbs use in solid tumors faces considerable challenges, such as target Ag selection, biodistribution, and the presence of an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).

Standard therapy for paediatric AML has remained largely unchanged for over four decades and, combined with inadequate understanding of the biology of paediatric AML, has limited the progress of targeted therapies in this cohort. In recent years, the search for novel targets for the treatment of paediatric AML has accelerated in parallel with advanced genomic technologies which explore the mutational and transcriptional landscape of this disease. Exploiting the large combinatorial space of existing drugs provides an untapped resource for the identification of potential combination therapies for the treatment of paediatric AML. We have previously designed a multiplex screening strategy known as Multiplex Screening for Interacting Compounds in AML (MuSICAL); using an algorithm designed in-house, we screened all pairings of 384 FDA-approved compounds in less than 4000 wells by pooling drugs into 10 compounds per well. This approach maximised the probability of identifying new compound combinations with therapeutic potential while minimising cost, replication and redundancy. This screening strategy identified the triple combination of glimepiride, a sulfonylurea; pancuronium dibromide, a neuromuscular blocking agent; and vinblastine sulfate, a vinca alkaloid, as a potential therapy for paediatric AML.

Despite considerable improvement in treatment options and survival parameters in the new millennium, many patients with HM still develop chemotherapyrefractory diseases and require re-treatment. Because frontline therapies for the majority of HM (except for CLL) are still largely based on classical cytostatics, the relapses are often associated with defects in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways and anti-apoptotic blocks exemplified, respectively, by mutations or deletion of the TP53 tumor suppressor, and overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family. BCL2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics represent a novel class of pro-apoptotic anti-cancer agents with a unique mode of action-direct targeting of mitochondria independently of TP53 gene aberrations. Consequently, BH3 mimetics can effectively eliminate even non-dividing malignant cells with adverse molecular cytogenetic alterations. Venetoclax, the nanomolar inhibitor of BCL2 anti-apoptotic protein has been approved for the therapy of CLL and AML. Numerous venetoclax-based combinatorial treatment regimens, next-generation BCL2 inhibitors, and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) protein inhibitors, which are another class of BH3 mimetics with promising preclinical results, are currently being tested in several clinical trials in patients with diverse HM. These pivotal trials will soon answer critical questions and concerns about these innovative agents regarding not only their anti-tumor efficacy but also potential side effects, recommended dosages, and the optimal length of therapy as well as identification of reliable biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance. Effective harnessing of the full therapeutic potential of BH3 mimetics is a critical mission as it may directly translate into better management of the aggressive forms of HM and could lead to significantly improved survival parameters and quality of life in patients with urgent medical needs.",,"['Klener, Pavel', 'Sovilj, Dana', 'Renesova, Nicol', 'Andera, Ladislav']","['Klener P', 'Sovilj D', 'Renesova N', 'Andera L']","['First Department of Internal MedicineHematology, General University Hospital in Prague, 121 08 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pathological Physiology, Charles University, 121 08 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biotechnology CAS/BIOCEV, 252 50 Vestec, Czech Republic.', 'First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pathological Physiology, Charles University, 121 08 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biotechnology CAS/BIOCEV, 252 50 Vestec, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics CAS, 142 20 Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210921,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BH3 mimetics', 'apoptosis', 'biomarkers', 'hematologic malignancies', 'resistance', 'targeted therapy', 'venetoclax']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/09/28 01:19'],"['2021/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:19 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms221810157 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms221810157 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Sep 21;22(18). pii: ijms221810157. doi: 10.3390/ijms221810157.,20211101,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/therapeutic use', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",18,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7786-9378', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8701-5912']","['AZV NU21-03-00386/Agentura Pro Zdravotnicky Vyzkum Ceske Republiky', 'GACR17-14007S and GACR19-08772S/Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky', 'Center of Excellence UNCE/MED/016/Univerzita Karlova v Praze', 'PROGRES Q26/LF1 and PROGRES Q28/LF1/Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy']",PMC8466478,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, pharmacological inhibition (PTC596) or knockdown (siRNA) of BMI-1 reduced cancer stem-like cells and enhanced cancer cell death. Mechanistically, the inhibition of BMI-1 induced the downregulation of Mcl-1 protein, but not Mcl-1 mRNA. PTC596 downregulated Mcl-1 protein expression at the post-translational level through the proteasome-ubiquitin system. PTC596 and BMI-1 siRNA induced downregulation of DUB3 deubiquitinase, which was strongly linked to Mcl-1 destabilization. Furthermore, overexpression of Mcl-1 or DUB3 inhibited apoptosis by PTC596.

Therefore, it is essential for understanding gene function. Meganucleases were the start of genome engineering, and it continued with the discovery of Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), followed by Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). They can generate double-strand breaks at a desired target site in the genome, and therefore can be used to knock in mutations or knock out genes in the same way. Years later, genome engineering was transformed by the discovery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Implementation of CRISPR systems involves recognition guided by RNA and the precise cleaving of DNA molecules. This property proves its utility in epigenetics and genome engineering. CRISPR has been and is being continuously successfully used to model mutations in leukemic cell lines and control gene expression. Furthermore, it is used to identify targets and discover drugs for immune therapies.

These enzymes are known for introducing methyl marks at specific locations of histone proteins, creating a complex system that regulates epigenetic control of gene expression and cell differentiation. Here, we describe the identification of first-generation cell-permeable non-nucleoside type inhibitors of SETD2, the only mammalian HMT that is able to tri-methylate the K36 residue of histone H3. By generating the epigenetic mark H3K36me3, SETD2 is involved in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia. We developed a structure-based virtual screening protocol that was first validated in retrospective studies.

Also, synthetic GC derivatives (pharmacological GCs) constitute the first-line treatment in many chronic inflammatory conditions with unquestionable therapeutic benefits despite the associated adverse effects. GC actions are principally mediated through the GC receptor (GR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Despite the ubiquitous expression of GR, imbalances in GC signalling affect tissues differently, and with variable degrees of severity through mechanisms that are not completely deciphered. Congenital or acquired GC hypersensitivity or resistance syndromes can impact responsiveness to endogenous or pharmacological GCs, causing disease or inadequate therapeutic outcomes, respectively. Acquired GC resistance is defined as loss of efficacy or desensitization over time, and arises as a consequence of chronic inflammation, affecting around 30% of GC-treated patients. It represents an important limitation in the management of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer, and can be due to impairment of multiple mechanisms along the GC signalling pathway. Among them, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and/or alterations in expression of their regulators, the dual-specific phosphatases (DUSPs), have been identified as common mechanisms of GC resistance. While many of the anti-inflammatory actions of GCs rely on GR-mediated inhibition of MAPKs and/or induction of DUSPs, the GC anti-inflammatory capacity is decreased or lost in conditions of excessive MAPK activation, contributing to disease susceptibility in tissue- and disease- specific manners. Here, we discuss potential strategies to modulate GC responsiveness, with the dual goal of overcoming GC resistance and minimizing the onset and severity of unwanted adverse effects while maintaining therapeutic potential.",,"['Sevilla, Lisa M', 'Jimenez-Panizo, Alba', 'Alegre-Marti, Andrea', 'Estebanez-Perpina, Eva', 'Caelles, Carme', 'Perez, Paloma']","['Sevilla LM', 'Jimenez-Panizo A', 'Alegre-Marti A', 'Estebanez-Perpina E', 'Caelles C', 'Perez P']","['Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia (IBV)-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona (UB), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Barcelona (IBUB), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona (UB), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Barcelona (IBUB), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona (UB), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Barcelona (IBUB), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Barcelona (IBUB), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, School of Pharmacy and Food Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia (IBV)-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210917,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic inflammation', 'dual-specific phosphatases (DUSPs)', 'glucocorticoid receptor', 'glucocorticoids', 'leukaemia', 'mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)', 'resistance/sensitivity', 'therapeutics']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/09/28 01:18'],"['2021/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:18 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms221810049 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms221810049 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Sep 17;22(18). pii: ijms221810049. doi: 10.3390/ijms221810049.,20211115,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Deficiency']","['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/therapy', 'Chronic Disease', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucocorticoids/*metabolism', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Leukemia/therapy', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Respiration Disorders/therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Diseases/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",18,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7046-6162', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2687-5801', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7166-2824']","['SAF2017-88046-R; PID2020-114652RB-I00; BFU-2017-86906-R;', 'PID2020-119875RB-100/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion']",PMC8465023,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we discovered new aspects of NO2-OA involvement in the regulation of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation. Murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) or mESC-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) were exposed to NO2-OA or oleic acid (OA) for selected time periods. Our results showed that NO2-OA but not OA caused the loss of pluripotency of mESC cultivated in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) rich medium via the decrease of pluripotency markers (NANOG, sex-determining region Y-box 1 transcription factor (SOX2), and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4)). The effects of NO2-OA on mESC correlated with reduced phosphorylation of STAT3. Subsequent differentiation led to an increase of the ectodermal marker orthodenticle homolog 2 (Otx2). Similarly, treatment of mESC-derived EBs by NO2-OA resulted in the up-regulation of both neural markers Nestin and beta-Tubulin class III (Tubb3). Interestingly, the expression of cardiac-specific genes and beating of EBs were significantly decreased. In conclusion, NO2-OA is able to modulate pluripotency of mESC via the regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation. Further, it attenuates cardiac differentiation on the one hand, and on the other hand, it directs mESC into neural fate.",,"['Pereckova, Jana', 'Pekarova, Michaela', 'Szamecova, Nikoletta', 'Hoferova, Zuzana', 'Kamarytova, Kristyna', 'Falk, Martin', 'Perecko, Tomas']","['Pereckova J', 'Pekarova M', 'Szamecova N', 'Hoferova Z', 'Kamarytova K', 'Falk M', 'Perecko T']","['Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Department of Cell Biology and Radiobiology, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Department of Cell Biology and Radiobiology, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Department of Cell Biology and Radiobiology, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Department of Cell Biology and Radiobiology, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Department of Cell Biology and Radiobiology, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Department of Cell Biology and Radiobiology, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Department of Cell Biology and Radiobiology, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210915,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT3', 'cardiomyogenesis', 'mouse embryonic stem cells', 'neurogenesis', 'nitro-oleic acid', 'pluripotency']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/09/28 01:18'],"['2021/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:18 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22189981 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22189981 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Sep 15;22(18). pii: ijms22189981. doi: 10.3390/ijms22189981.,20211019,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Nitro Compounds)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '1N19AGY57Y (CXA-10)']","['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Embryoid Bodies/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitro Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Oleic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Organogenesis/drug effects', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",18,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7565-993X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9229-0468', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4278-4088']","['17-08066Y/Czech Science Foundation', 'LTAUSA17160/Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports', 'No. L200041802/Czech Academy of Sciences']",PMC8468660,,,,,,,,,,

Most targeted therapies, which include small molecules, act on specific molecular targets that are altered in tumour cells, mainly in cancers such as breast, lung, colorectal, lymphoma and leukaemia. With the recent exponential progress in drug development, programmed cell death, which includes apoptosis and autophagy, has become a promising therapeutic target. The research in identifying effective small molecules that target compensatory mechanisms in tumour cells alleviates the emergence of drug resistance. Due to the heterogenous nature of breast cancer, various attempts were made to overcome chemoresistance. Amongst breast cancers, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is of particular interest due to its heterogeneous nature in response to chemotherapy. TNBC represents approximately 15% of all breast tumours, however, and still has a poor prognosis. Unlike other breast tumours, signature targets lack for TNBCs, causing high morbidity and mortality. This review highlights several small molecules with promising preclinical data that target autophagy and apoptosis to induce cell death in TNBC cells.",,"['Maniam, Subashani', 'Maniam, Sandra']","['Maniam S', 'Maniam S']","['School of Science, STEM College, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC 3001, Australia.', 'Department of Human Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210908,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'breast cancer', 'programmed cell death', 'small molecule']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/09/28 01:17'],"['2021/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:17 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22189722 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22189722 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Sep 8;22(18). pii: ijms22189722. doi: 10.3390/ijms22189722.,20211028,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy/drug effects/genetics', 'Biological Products/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', '*Drug Discovery/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics']",18,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0272-864X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5335-6666']","['GP/2018/9616500/Universiti Putra Malaysia', 'ECDF/RMIT University']",PMC8465612,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, oncogenes are viewed as deregulating cell proliferation or suppressing apoptosis in driving cancer. The cancer stem cell theory states that most, if not all, cancers are a hierarchy of cells that arises from a transformed tissue-specific stem cell. These normal counterparts generate various cell types of a tissue, which adds a new dimension to how oncogenes might lead to the anarchic behavior of cancer cells. It is that stem cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells, replenish mature cell types to meet the demands of an organism. Some oncogenes appear to deregulate this homeostatic process by restricting leukemia stem cells to a single cell lineage. This review examines whether cancer is a legacy of stem cells that lose their inherent versatility, the extent that proto-oncogenes play a role in cell lineage determination, and the role that epigenetic events play in regulating cell fate and tumorigenesis.",,"['Brown, Geoffrey']",['Brown G'],"['Institute of Clinical Sciences, School of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210907,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['epigenetics', 'lineage determination', 'oncogenes', 'proto-oncogenes', 'stem cells']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/09/28 01:16'],"['2021/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:16 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22189667 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22189667 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Sep 7;22(18). pii: ijms22189667. doi: 10.3390/ijms22189667.,20211029,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",18,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0821-0275'],['315902/Seventh Framework Programme'],PMC8470404,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we describe the management of this complication and the results of microbiological tests useful to guide the treatment. All cases reported show failure of voriconazole treatment. In the majority of cases a good susceptibility to posaconazole has been reported, which seems to have a good clinical impact; however, only L-AmB shows a clinical effect to produce quick clinical improvement and so it should be a drug of choice. A literature revision shows that only a few papers have thus far described this infection, at present only one case was reported in a hematological setting like a gastrointestinal graft versus host disease in an allogeneic HSCT recipient.

Seventy-five patients (30%) received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant within the first year after induction chemotherapy. Proven/probable IFD occurred in 17 patients (7%). Twelve of the 17 (71%) were mold infections, including aspergillosis (n = 6), fusariosis (n = 3), and mucomycosis (n = 3). Eight breakthrough IFD (B-IFD), seven of which were due to molds, occurred in patients taking antifungal prophylaxis. Patients with proven/probable IFD had a significantly greater number of cumulative neutropenic days than those without an IFD, HR = 1.038 (95% CI 1.018-1.059), p = 0.0001. By cause-specific proportional hazards regression, the risk for IFD increased by 3.8% for each day of neutropenia per 100 days of follow up. Relapsed/refractory AML significantly increased the risk for IFD, HR = 7.562 (2.585-22.123), p = 0.0002, and Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly higher mortality at 1 year in patients who developed a proven/probable IFD, p = 0.02.

In gastrointestinal cancers, TP53 target 1 (TP53TG1) is an epigenetically regulated lncRNA that represents a promising therapeutic target due to its tumor suppressor properties regulating the p53-mediated DNA damage and the intracellular localization of the oncogenic YBX1 protein. However, to translate this finding into the clinic as a gene therapy, it is important to develop effective carriers able to deliver exogenous lncRNAs to the targeted cancer cells.

DSNs presented a high association capacity and convenient physicochemical properties. In addition, pc(TP53TG1)-DSNs showed anti-tumor activities in vitro, specifically a decrease in the proliferation rate, a diminished colony-forming capacity, and hampered migration and invasiveness of the treated cancer cells.

This review attempts to provide an overview of the effects of TKIs licensed for children (e.g., imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib) on immune function, as well as its implications on immunizations. We discuss surveillance strategies (e.g., immunoglobulin blood serum levels and hepatitis B reactivation) and immunizations. All inactivated vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal, and streptococcal) can be given during the treatment of CML in the chronic phase, although their efficacy may be lower. As shown in single cases of children and adults with CML, live vaccines (e.g., varicella, measles, mumps, rubella, and yellow fever) may be administered under defined circumstances with great precautions.

However, use of DOX is limited due to its cardiotoxic effects. This study sequentially investigated the mechanistic pathways of the cardiotoxic process of DOX in rats at different post-treatment periods using cumulative dose, which is used in therapeutic regimes. In this regard, 56 male albino rats were used for the experiment. The experimental animals were divided into seven groups (n = 8/group) based on dose and sacrifice schedule as follows: G1 (2 mg/kg body weight [BW] and sacrificed at day 4), G2 (4 mg/kg BW and sacrificed at day 8), G3 (6 mg/kg BW and sacrificed at day 15), G4 (8 mg/kg BW and sacrificed at day 30), G5 (10 mg/kg BW and sacrificed at day 60), G6 (10 mg/kg BW and sacrificed at day 90), and G7 (10 mg/kg BW and sacrificed at day 120). As expected, G1, G2, and G3-treated groups revealed features of acute toxic myocarditis associated with degenerative and necrotic changes in myocytes, mitochondrial damage, elevation of cardiac biomarkers, and depletion of cellular antioxidant enzymes. However, these changes increased in severity with subsequent treatment with the same dose until reaching a cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg BW for 30 d. Furthermore, after a cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg BW with a withdrawal period of 2-3 months, various predominant changes in chronicity were reported, such as disorganization and atrophy of myocytes, condensation and atrophy of mitochondria, degranulation of mast cells, and fibrosis with occasional focal necrosis, indicating incomplete elimination of DOX and/or its metabolites. Altogether, these data provide interesting observations associated with the cardiotoxic process of DOX in rats that would help understand the accompanying changes underlying the major toxic effects of the drug. Future research is suggested to explore more about the dose-dependent mechanisms of such induced toxicity of DOX that would help determine the proper doses and understand the resulting cardiomyopathy.",,"['Abdelatty, Alaa', 'Ahmed, Mohamed S', 'Abdel-Kareem, Mona A', 'Dmerdash, Mohamed', 'Mady, Rehab', 'Saad, Ahmed S', 'Albrakati, Ashraf', 'Elmahallawy, Ehab Kotb', 'Elsawak, Ahmed', 'Abdo, Walied']","['Abdelatty A', 'Ahmed MS', 'Abdel-Kareem MA', 'Dmerdash M', 'Mady R', 'Saad AS', 'Albrakati A', 'Elmahallawy EK', 'Elsawak A', 'Abdo W']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kafrelsheikh University, Kafr Elsheikh 33516, Egypt.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kafrelsheikh University, Kafr Elsheikh 33516, Egypt.', 'Anatomy and Embryology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Kafrelsheikh University, Kafr Elsheikh 33516, Egypt.', 'Anatomy Department, Faculty of Medicine Al-azhar University, Cairo 11884, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Damanhour University, Damanhour 22511, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Port Said University, Port Said 42526, Egypt.', 'Department of Human Anatomy, College of Medicine, Taif University, P.O.

Hence, we aimed to develop an algorithm derived from CPD parameters to enable robust screening of neoplastic from non-neoplastic samples and subsequently to aid in differentiating various neoplastic haematological disorders. In this study, the CPD parameters from 245 subtypes of leukaemia and lymphoma were compared against 1103 non-neoplastic cases, and those CPD parameters that were vigorous discriminants were selected for algorithm development. We devised a novel algorithm: [(SD-V-NE*MN-UMALS-LY*SD-AL2-MO)/MN-C-NE] to distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic cases. Following that, the single parameter MN-AL2-NE was used as a discriminant to rule out reactive cases from neoplastic cases. We then assessed CPD parameters that were useful in delineating leukaemia subtypes as follows: AML (SD-MALS-NE and SD-UMALS-NE), APL (MN-V-NE and SD-V-MO), ALL (MN-MALS-NE and MN-LMALS-NE) and CLL (SD-C-MO).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) detects cytoplasmic NPM1 and is predictive of the molecular alteration. Besides IHC and molecular sequencing, Western blotting (WB) with anti-NPM1 mutant specific antibodies is another approach to identify NPM1-mutated AML.

Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the drugs of choice in the therapy of Ph+ ALL. In combination with standard chemotherapy, TKIs have markedly improved the outcome of Ph+ ALL, in particular if this treatment is followed by bone marrow transplantation. However, resistance to TKIs develops with high frequency, causing leukemia relapse that results in <5-year overall survival. Thus, new therapies are needed to address relapsed/TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL. We have shown that expression of cell cycle regulatory kinase CDK6, but not of the highly related CDK4 kinase, is required for the proliferation and survival of Ph+ ALL cells. Comparison of leukemia suppression induced by treatment with the clinically-approved dual CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib versus CDK6 silencing revealed that the latter treatment was markedly more effective, probably reflecting inhibition of CDK6 kinase-independent effects. Thus, we developed CDK4/6-targeted proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that preferentially degrade CDK6 over CDK4. One compound termed PROTAC YX-2-107, which degrades CDK6 by recruiting the Cereblon ubiquitin ligase, markedly suppressed leukemia burden in mice injected with de novo or TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL. The effect of PROTAC YX-2-107 was comparable or superior to that of palbociclib. The development of CDK6-selective PROTACs represents an effective strategy to exploit the ""CDK6 dependence"" of Ph+ ALL cells while sparing a high proportion of normal hematopoietic progenitors that depend on both CDK6 and CDK6 for their survival. In combination with other agents, CDK6-selective PROTACs may be valuable components of chemotherapy-free protocols for the therapy of Ph+ ALL and other CDK6-dependent hematological malignancies.",,"['Porazzi, Patrizia', 'De Dominici, Marco', 'Salvino, Joseph', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Porazzi P', 'De Dominici M', 'Salvino J', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210829,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*cell cycle', '*chemotherapy', '*kinase', '*proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs)']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2021/09/28 01:08'],"['2021/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['genes12091355 [pii]', '10.3390/genes12091355 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2021 Aug 29;12(9). pii: genes12091355. doi: 10.3390/genes12091355.,,,,9,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1372-7482', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2184-5980']","['R01 CA257251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL127895/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8467343,,,,,,,,,,

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate staining. Expressions of proteins and genes were examined by Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, respectively. BetA (20 muM) and Dox (1 muM) indicated a synergistic growth inhibitory effect on MOLM-13 cells. The combined drug caused more cells to reside in irreversible late apoptotic stage compared to the single treatments (p < 0.05). Elevation in ROS may be the synergistic mechanism involved in MOLM-13 cell death since ROS can directly disrupt mitochondrial activity. In contrast, in leukaemic U-937 cells, the combination treatments attenuated Dox-induced cell death. Dox and the drug combination selectively reduced (p < 0.05) a recently reported anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein isoform p15-20-Bcl-2 in MOLM-13 by our group, without affecting the usually reported p26-Bcl-2-alpha.

Several natural products activate nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling, attenuating inflammatory responses. Ergosta-7,9(11),22-trien-3beta-ol (EK100) isolated from Cordyceps militaris showed anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activity, but those mechanisms are still unclear. This study is the first to investigate EK100 on antioxidant Nrf2 relative genes expression in LPS-stimulated macrophage-like cell lines. The results showed that EK100 reduced IL-6 (interleukin-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. EK100 also attenuated a mitogen-activated protein kinase/activator protein-1 (MAPK/AP-1) pathway and interleukin-6/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (IL-6/JAK/STAT) pathway in LPS-stimulated cells. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor CLI-095 and MAPK inhibitors can synergize the anti-inflammatory response of EK100 in LPS-stimulated cells. Moreover, EK100 activated Nrf2/HO-1 (heme oxygenase-1) signaling in LPS-stimulated murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, murine microglial BV2 cells, and human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. However, Nrf2 small interfering RNA (Nrf2 siRNA) reversed EK100-induced antioxidative proteins expressions. In conclusion, EK100 showed anti-inflammatory responses via activating the antioxidative Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and inhibiting TLR4 related MAPK/AP-1 induced IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways in the LPS-stimulated cells in vitro.

However, they were rarely investigated for Nepenthes ethyl acetate extract (EANT), especially leukemia cells. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant properties and explore the antiproliferation impact and mechanism of EANT in leukemia cells. Five standard assays demonstrated that EANT exhibits antioxidant capability. In the cell line model, EANT dose-responsively inhibited cell viabilities of three leukemia cell lines (HL-60, K-562, and MOLT-4) based on 24 h MTS assays, which were reverted by pretreating oxidative stress and apoptosis inhibitors (N-acetylcysteine and Z-VAD-FMK). Due to similar sensitivities among the three cell lines, leukemia HL-60 cells were chosen for exploring antiproliferation mechanisms. EANT caused subG1 and G1 cumulations, triggered annexin V-detected apoptosis, activated apoptotic caspase 3/7 activity, and induced poly ADP-ribose polymerase expression. Moreover, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial superoxide, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were generated by EANT, which was reverted by N-acetylcysteine. The antioxidant response to oxidative stress showed that EANT upregulated mRNA expressions for nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2), catalase (CAT), thioredoxin (TXN), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) genes. Moreover, these oxidative stresses led to DNA damage (gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine) and were alleviated by N-acetylcysteine.

This is exemplified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), one of the most common adult hematologic malignancies, in which functional loss of p53 arising from genomic aberrations are frequently associated with clonal evolution, disease progression, and therapeutic resistance, even in the contemporary era of CLL targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Targeting the 'undruggable' p53 pathway therefore arguably represents the holy grail of cancer research. In recent years, several strategies have been proposed to exploit p53 pathway defects for cancer treatment. Such strategies include upregulating wild-type p53, restoring tumor suppressive function in mutant p53, inducing synthetic lethality by targeting collateral genome maintenance pathways, and harnessing the immunogenicity of p53 pathway aberrations. In this review, we will examine the biological and clinical implications of p53 pathway defects, as well as our progress towards development of therapeutic approaches targeting the p53 pathway, specifically within the context of CLL.

However, the clinical chemotherapy for T-ALL has been limited by numerous side effects, emphasizing that novel anti-T-ALL drugs are urgently needed. Herein, a series of 2-acyl-1-dimethylaminomethyl-ferrocenes for cancer therapy have been evaluated. Among them, F1 and F3 exhibited potent cytotoxicity against T-ALL cell lines, especially Jurkat cells, with low cytotoxicity for normal cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that F1 and F3 could induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells by destructing mitochondrial membrane, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, decreasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, releasing Cytochrome c, and increasing the expression of Cleaved Caspase-9/-3 and Cleaved PARP. Additionally, F1 and F3 could suppress cell proliferation and arrest the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by down-regulating the expression of CDK6, Cyclin D1, p-Akt, p-GSK-3beta, p-mTOR, p-p70 S6K, and up-regulating the expression of P21 and P27, which would also be a possible mechanism. Consequently, ferrocene derivatives F1 and F3 could induce apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway mediated by ROS, and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in Jurkat cells.

Most of these compounds function as inhibitors of key cell cycle enzymatic pathways or mediators of leukemic proliferation and survival. They have been approved both as single agents and in combination with conventional or reduced-intensity conventional chemotherapeutics. In this article, we review the molecular landscape of de novo vs. R/R AML and highlight the potential translational impact of defined molecular disease subsets. We also highlight several recent agents that have entered the therapeutic armamentarium and where they fit in the AML treatment landscape, with a focus on FLT3 inhibitors, IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors, and venetoclax.

Many of its numerical and structural abnormalities define diagnostically and clinically important subgroups. To obtain an overview about their types and their approximate genetic subgroup-specific incidence and distribution, we performed cytogenetic, FISH and array analyses in a total of 578 ALL patients (including 26 with a constitutional trisomy 21). The latter is the preferred method to assess genome-wide large and fine-scale copy number abnormalities (CNA) together with their corresponding allele distribution patterns. We identified a total of 258 cases (49%) with chromosome 21-associated CNA, a number that is perhaps lower-than-expected because ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases (11%) were significantly underrepresented in this array-analyzed cohort. Our most interesting observations relate to hyperdiploid leukemias with tetra- and pentasomies of chromosome 21 that develop in constitutionally trisomic patients. Utilizing comparative short tandem repeat analyses, we were able to prove that switches in the array-derived allele patterns are in fact meiotic recombination sites, which only become evident in patients with inborn trisomies that result from a meiosis 1 error.

Venetoclax also induces autophagy by perturbing the Bcl-2/Beclin-1 complex, so autophagy might represent a target in CLL. Diverse autophagy inhibitors were assessed for cytotoxic activities against patient-derived CLL cells. The AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin, the ULK1/2 inhibitor MRT68921, and the autophagosome-lysosome fusion inhibitor chloroquine demonstrated concentration-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxicity against CLL cells, even in those from hard-to-treat patients who carried del(11q) and del(17p). Dorsomorphin and MRT68921 but not chloroquine triggered caspase-dependent cell death. According to the metabolic activities of CLL cells and PBMCs following treatments with 10 microM dorsomorphin (13% vs. 84%), 10 microM MRT68921 (7% vs. 78%), and 25 microM chloroquine (41% vs. 107%), these autophagy inhibitors are selective toward CLL cells.

We retrospectively analyzed the results of pediatric AML treatment in Poland from 1983 to 2019 (excluding promyelocytic, therapy-related, biphenotypic, and Down syndrome AML). METHODS: The study included 899 children suffering from AML treated with the following: AML-PPPLBC 83 (1983-1993, n = 187), AML-PPGLBC 94 (1994-1997, n = 74), AML-PPGLBC 98 (1998-2004, n = 151), AML-BFM 2004 Interim (2004-2015, n = 356), and AML-BFM 2012 (2015-2019, n = 131). RESULTS: The probability of three-year overall survival was 0.34 +/- 0.03, 0.37 +/- 0.05, 0.54 +/- 0.04, 0.67 +/- 0.03, and 0.75 +/- 0.05; event-free survival was 0.31 +/- 0.03, 0.34 +/- 0.05, 0.44 +/- 0.04, 0.53 +/- 0.03, and 0.67 +/- 0.05; and relapse-free survival was 0.52 +/- 0.03, 0.65 +/- 0.05, 0.58 +/- 0.04, 0.66 +/- 0.03, and 0.78 +/- 0.05, respectively, in the subsequent periods. A systematic reduction of early deaths and deaths in remission was achieved, while the percentage of relapses decreased only in the last therapeutic period. Surprisingly good results were obtained in the group of patients treated with AML-BFM 2012 with unfavorable genetic abnormalities like KMT2A-MLLT10/t(10;11)(p12;q23) and DEK-NUP214/t(6;9)(p23;q24), while unsatisfactory outcomes were found in the patients with FLT3-ITD. CONCLUSIONS: The use of standardized, systematically modified therapeutic protocols, with the successive consideration of genetic prognostic factors, and advances in supportive care led to a significant improvement in AML treatment outcomes over the last 40 years.",,"['Czogala, Malgorzata', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Pawinska-Wasikowska, Katarzyna', 'Ksiazek, Teofila', 'Bukowska-Strakova,

In order to proliferate, leukemic cells are highly dependent on complex interactions with their microenvironment in proliferative niches. Not only soluble factors and BCR stimulation are important for their survival and proliferation, but also the activation of transcription factors through different signaling pathways. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha are two transcription factors crucial for cancer development, whose activities are dependent on tumor microenvironment conditions, such as the presence of metabolites from the tryptophan pathway and hypoxia, respectively. In this study, we addressed the potential role of AHR and HIF-1alpha in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) development in vivo. To this end, we crossed the CLL mouse model Emicro-TCL1 with the corresponding transcription factor-conditional knock-out mice to delete one or both transcription factors in CD19+ B cells only. Despite AHR and HIF-1alpha being activated in CLL cells, deletion of either or both of them had no impact on CLL progression or survival in vivo, suggesting that these transcription factors are not crucial for leukemogenesis in CLL.",,"['Gonder, Susanne', 'Largeot, Anne', 'Gargiulo, Ernesto', 'Pierson, Sandrine', 'Fernandez Botana, Iria', 'Pagano, Giulia', 'Paggetti, Jerome', 'Moussay, Etienne']","['Gonder S', 'Largeot A', 'Gargiulo E', 'Pierson S', 'Fernandez Botana I', 'Pagano G', 'Paggetti J', 'Moussay E']","['Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, L-1526 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, L-4365 Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, L-1526 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, L-1526 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, L-1526 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, L-1526 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, L-4365 Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, L-1526 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, L-4365 Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, L-1526 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, L-1526 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210908,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['AHR', 'HIF1alpha', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'tumor microenvironment']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/09/29 06:01,['2021/09/28 01:06'],"['2021/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13184518 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13184518 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Sep 8;13(18). pii: cancers13184518. doi: 10.3390/cancers13184518.,,,,18,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9388-8461', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4485-4599', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9460-5876', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0879-8067']","['7.4502.19/SG', '7.4503.19/AL', '7.4529.19/IFB', '7.6518.20/GP', 'PRIDE15/10675146/CANBIO/Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg to EG']",PMC8466120,,,,,,,,,,

Even with frontline high-intensity chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the majority of patients with AML will relapse. For these patients, treatment options are few, and novel therapies are urgently needed. Adoptive T-cell therapies represent an attractive therapeutic avenue due to the intrinsic ability of T lymphocytes to recognize tumor cells with high specificity and efficiency. In particular, T-cell therapies focused on introducing T-cell receptors (TCRs) against tumor antigens have achieved objective clinical responses in solid tumors such as synovial sarcoma and melanoma. However, contrary to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells with groundbreaking results in B-cell malignancies, the use of TCR-T cells for hematological malignancies is still in its infancy.

Finally, Vbeta usage by flow cytometry might identify LGL clones silently underlying other hematological conditions, and routine characterization of Vbeta skewing might identify recurrent TCR rearrangements that might trigger aberrant immune responses during hematological or autoimmune conditions.",,"['Giudice, Valentina', ""D'Addona, Matteo"", 'Montuori, Nunzia', 'Selleri, Carmine']","['Giudice V', ""D'Addona M"", 'Montuori N', 'Selleri C']","['Department of Medicine, Surgery, and Dentistry, Scuola Medica Salernitana, University of Salerno, 84081 Baronissi, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University Hospital ""San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgery, and Dentistry, Scuola Medica Salernitana, University of Salerno, 84081 Baronissi, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University Hospital ""San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, ""Federico II"" University, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgery, and Dentistry, Scuola Medica Salernitana, University of Salerno, 84081 Baronissi, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University Hospital ""San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210908,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['T large granular lymphocytic leukemia', 'Vbeta usage', 'clonality', 'flow cytometry']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/09/29 06:01,['2021/09/28 01:06'],"['2021/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13184513 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13184513 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Sep 8;13(18). pii: cancers13184513. doi: 10.3390/cancers13184513.,,,,18,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7492-6848', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8697-986X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5861-8984']",,PMC8468916,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds target the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), known to be essential for the viability of tumor cells. The induction of oxidative stress, depletion of glutathione, and induction of high-molecular-weight (HMW) complexes have also been reported. We here examined the response of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to the dienone compound VLX1570. AML cells have relatively high protein turnover rates and have also been reported to be sensitive to depletion of reduced glutathione. We found AML cells of diverse cytogenetic backgrounds to be sensitive to VLX1570, with drug exposure resulting in an accumulation of ubiquitin complexes, induction of ER stress, and the loss of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase activation was observed but was not required for the loss of cell viability. Glutathione depletion was also observed but did not correlate to VLX1570 sensitivity. Formation of HMW complexes occurred at higher concentrations of VLX1570 than those required for the loss of cell viability and was not enhanced by glutathione depletion. To study the effect of VLX1570 we developed a zebrafish PDX model of AML and confirmed antigrowth activity in vivo. Our results show that VLX1570 induces UPS inhibition in AML cells and encourage further work in developing compounds useful for cancer therapeutics.",,"['Selvaraju, Karthik', 'Lotfi, Kourosh', 'Gubat, Johannes', 'Miquel, Maria', 'Nilsson, Amanda', 'Hill, Julia', 'Jensen, Lasse D', 'Linder, Stig', ""D'Arcy, Padraig""]","['Selvaraju K', 'Lotfi K', 'Gubat J', 'Miquel M', 'Nilsson A', 'Hill J', 'Jensen LD', 'Linder S', ""D'Arcy P""]","['Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Health, Medical and Caring Sciences (HMV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institute, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), Linkoping University, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210910,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*deubiquitinase', '*proteasome', '*ubiquitin', '*zebrafish']",2021/09/29 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/09/28 01:06'],"['2021/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['biom11091339 [pii]', '10.3390/biom11091339 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2021 Sep 10;11(9). pii: biom11091339. doi: 10.3390/biom11091339.,20220113,"['0 (Azepines)', '0 (Benzylidene Compounds)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (VLX1570)', '120904-94-1 (Polyubiquitin)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']","['Animals', 'Azepines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzylidene Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polyubiquitin/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Ubiquitin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'Zebrafish/embryology']",9,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5797-7232', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5645-3346', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2338-357X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4952-445X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6671-7600']",,PMC8470745,,,,,,,,,,

In a step to develop new marine-inspired potent kinase inhibitors with antiproliferative activities, a new series of hybrid small molecules (5a-5g) was designed and synthesized based on chemical moieties derived from two marine natural products (Meridianin E and Leucettamine B). Over a panel of 14 cancer-related kinases, a single dose of 10 microM of the parent hybrid 5a possessing the benzo[d][1,3]dioxole moiety of Leucettamine B was able to inhibit the activity of FMS, LCK, LYN, and DAPK1 kinases with 82.5 +/- 0.6, 81.4 +/- 0.6, 75.2 +/- 0.0, and 55 +/- 1.1%, respectively. Further optimization revealed the most potent multiple kinase inhibitor of this new series (5g) with IC50 values of 110, 87.7, and 169 nM against FMS, LCK, and LYN kinases, respectively. Compared to imatinib (FDA-approved multiple kinase inhibitor), compound 5g was found to be ~ 9- and 2-fold more potent than imatinib over both FMS and LCK kinases, respectively. In silico docking simulation models of the synthesized compounds within the active site of FMS, LCK, LYN, and DAPK1 kinases offered reasonable explanations of the elicited biological activities. In an in vitro anticancer assay using a library of 60 cancer cell lines that include blood, lung, colon, CNS, skin, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancers, it was found that compound 5g was able to suppress 60 and 70% of tumor growth in leukemia SR and renal RXF 393 cell lines, respectively. Moreover, an ADME study indicated a suitable profile of compound 5g concerning cell permeability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeability, avoiding possible CNS side effects. Accordingly, compound 5g is reported as a potential lead towards novel antiproliferative marine-derived kinase modulators.",,"['Elsherbeny, Mohamed H', 'Elkamhawy, Ahmed', 'Nada, Hossam', 'Abdellattif, Magda H', 'Lee, Kyeong', 'Roh, Eun Joo']","['Elsherbeny MH', 'Elkamhawy A', 'Nada H', 'Abdellattif MH', 'Lee K', 'Roh EJ']","['Chemical Kinomics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul 02792, Korea.', 'Division of Bio-Medical Science & Technology, KIST School, University of Science and Technology, Seoul 02792, Korea.', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahram Canadian University, Giza 12566, Egypt.', 'College of Pharmacy, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.', 'College of Pharmacy, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea.', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Badr University, Cairo 11829, Egypt.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Science, Taif University, P.O.

As a result, the anti-cancer drugs bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib targeting the 26S proteasome were developed to treat multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, among others. Despite success, adverse side effects and drug resistance are prominent, raising the need for alternative therapeutic options. We recently demonstrated that knockdown of the 19S regulatory components, 26S proteasome non-ATPase subunits 1 (PSMD1) and 3 (PSMD3), resulted in increased apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, but had no effect on normal controls, suggesting they may be good targets for therapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that PSMD1 and PSMD3 are potential targets for anti-cancer therapeutics and that their relevance stretches beyond CML to other types of cancers. In the present study, we analyzed PSMD1 and PSMD3 mRNA and protein expression in cancerous tissue versus normal controls using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), comparing expression with overall survival.

The origin of this neoplasm is attributed to an early deregulation of the Ras signaling pathway in multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Since JMML is notoriously refractory to conventional cytostatic therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the mainstay of curative therapy for most cases. However, alternative therapeutic approaches with small epigenetic molecules have recently entered the stage and show surprising efficacy at least in specific subsets of patients. Hence, the establishment of preclinical models to test novel agents is a priority. Induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) offer an opportunity to imitate JMML ex vivo, after attempts to generate immortalized cell lines from primary JMML material have largely failed in the past. Several research groups have previously generated patient-derived JMML IPSCs and successfully differentiated these into myeloid cells with extensive phenotypic similarities to primary JMML cells. With infinite self-renewal and the capability to differentiate into multiple cell types, JMML IPSCs are a promising resource to advance the development of treatment modalities targeting specific vulnerabilities.

RHO GEFs, including VAV proteins, play essential signaling roles in a wide variety of fundamental cellular processes and in human diseases. Although the most widespread archetype in the field is that RHO GEFs exert proactive functions in cancer, recent studies in mice and humans are providing new insights into the in vivo function of these proteins in cancer. These results suggest a more complex scenario where the role of GEFs is not so clearly defined. For example, VAV1 can unexpectedly play non-catalytic tumor suppressor functions in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) by controlling the levels of the active form of NOTCH1 (ICN1). This review focuses on emerging work unveiling tumor suppressor roles for these proteins that should prompt a reevaluation of the role of VAV GEF family in tumor biology.",,"['Cuadrado, Myriam', 'Robles-Valero, Javier']","['Cuadrado M', 'Robles-Valero J']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), CSIC-University of Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-University of Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), CSIC-University of Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210908,Switzerland,Biology (Basel),Biology,101587988,,['NOTNLM'],"['NFAT', 'NOTCH1', 'PTCL', 'RAC1', 'RHO GEFs', 'T-ALL', 'VAV proteins', 'lung cancer', 'mouse models', 'oncogene', 'signaling', 'tumor suppressor']",2021/09/29 06:00,2021/09/29 06:01,['2021/09/28 01:03'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:01 [medline]']","['biology10090888 [pii]', '10.3390/biology10090888 [doi]']",epublish,Biology (Basel). 2021 Sep 8;10(9). pii: biology10090888. doi: 10.3390/biology10090888.,,,,9,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9410-1205', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5218-0187']","['PI20/01724/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'Fundacion Cientifica Asociacion Espanola Contra el Cancer', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer']",PMC8466051,,,,,,,,,,

In children, it appears more frequently in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), particularly in subtypes with a monocytic component. Methods: We studied a retrospective cohort including all AML cases from the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez between January 2009 to December 2019 and described the clinical characteristics of those who presented LC and other mucocutaneous manifestations. The information was collected from clinical records and analyzed using SPSS software (version 17). Results: We identified 54 AML cases: 53.7% were males, and 75.9% of the patients presented at least one dermatosis in the course of the disease. LC was clinically present in 14.8% of patients and was histologically confirmed in 9.2% of them; two congenital leukemia cases were identified. Among these patients, LC was more frequent in males. LC patients were younger than those without LC, the most frequent AML subtype was M2 (37.5%), and the most frequent clinical manifestations were plaques, chloromas, and gingival hyperplasia. None of the patients presented LC before AML diagnosis. Conclusions: Currently, only a few studies about LC on pediatric populations have been reported, and the existing ones have small sample sizes.

In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of DHA on apoptosis in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell lines. METHODS: The cells were treated separately and combined by DHA and Fludurabine (FLU) during 24, 48 and 72 hours. The cell viabilities determined by XTT method. Following separate and combined treatment of IC50 concentrations of DHA and FLU to the cells during 24 hours, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the effects on apopotis staining with AnnexinV FITC and PI. mRNA and protein expression levels of TCTP, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3 were analyzed to find out the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis by using quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometric methods. RESULTS: Treatment with DHA alone or in combination with FLU induced apoptosis in a dose dependent manner in CLL cells. DHA alone was more effective than FLU alone or combined treatment with DHA and FLU. Our results suggest that Bcl-2 protein family member Bax was active in the apoptotic response of CLL cells after DHA treatment. Moreover, the apoptotic response induced by DHA was independent from the p53 mutation status of the CLL cells. CONCLUSION: DHA might be a potential anti-cancer therapeutic for CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, targeting LSCs is of primary importance to eradicate CML. The present study demonstrates that picropodophyllin (PPP) effectively induces apoptosis and inhibits colony formation in CML stem/progenitor cells as well as quiescent CML progenitors resistant to imatinib therapy, while sparing normal hematopoietic cells in vitro. Administration of PPP in vivo markedly diminishes CML stem/progenitor cells in a transgenic mouse model of CML by inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis in LSK cells, and significantly improves survival of CML mice. Furthermore, PPP treatment preferentially leads to transcriptional activation of p53 in CML but not normal CD34(+) cells, upregulation of p53 protein in LSCs-enriched Sca-1(+) cells from CML mice, and increased phosphorylation of p53 and upregulation of Bax protein in Ku812 cells. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of PPP on CML stem/progenitor cells are associated with selective activation of p53 pathway and propose that PPP is a potent agent that selectively targets CML LSCs, and may be of value in the CML therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

At diagnosis, treatment decisions need to be made quickly to mitigate risks associated with profound cytopenias. As genetic testing options are rapidly evolving, an efficient multi-disciplinary approach and algorithm, including early involvement of a genetics team, is needed to expedite diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making. This process aids in the identification of appropriate candidates for molecular genetic testing. We present our single center experience reviewing the implementation of genetic counseling and a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm used to guide genetic evaluation of pediatric BMF. Disease-specific next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels were most often pursued in patients who presented with a clinical phenotype consistent with a known inherited BMF syndrome and when trying to reduce incidental or uninformative results. Broader BMF NGS panels were most often utilized when unable to narrow the suspected etiology to a single disorder. Whole exome sequencing helped with optimizing treatment decision-making in higher risk children with BMF who required expedited hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Here we report that post-transcriptional repression of the transcription factor ARID3A by miR-125b is a key event in megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) pathogenesis. AMKL is frequently associated with trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutations (GATA1s), and children with Down syndrome are at a high risk of developing this disease. We show that chromosome 21-encoded miR-125b synergizes with Gata1s to drive leukemogenesis in this context. Leveraging forward and reverse genetics, we uncover Arid3a as the main miR-125b target behind this synergy. We demonstrate that, during normal hematopoiesis, this transcription factor promotes megakaryocytic differentiation in concert with GATA1 and mediates TGFbeta-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in complex with SMAD2/3. While Gata1s mutations perturb erythroid differentiation and induce hyperproliferation of megakaryocytic progenitors, intact ARID3A expression assures their megakaryocytic differentiation and growth restriction. Upon knockdown, these tumor suppressive functions are revoked, causing a dual megakaryocytic/erythroid differentiation blockade and subsequently AMKL. Inversely, restoring ARID3A expression relieves the megakaryocytic differentiation arrest in AMKL patient-derived xenografts. This work illustrates how mutations in lineage-determining transcription factors and perturbation of post-transcriptional gene regulation can interplay to block multiple routes of hematopoietic differentiation and cause leukemia. In AMKL, surmounting this differentiation blockade through restoration of the tumor suppressor ARID3A represents a promising strategy for treating this lethal pediatric disease.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Alejo-Valle, Oriol', 'Weigert, Karoline', 'Bhayadia, Raj', 'Ng, Michelle', 'Issa, Hasan', 'Beyer, Christoph', 'Emmrich, Stephan', 'Schuschel, Konstantin', 'Ihling, Christian', 'Sinz, Andrea', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia', 'Flasinski, Marius', 'Regenyi, Eniko Melinda', 'Labuhn, Maurice', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Yaspo, Marie-Laure', 'Heckl, Dirk', 'Klusmann, Jan-Henning']","['Alejo-Valle O', 'Weigert K', 'Bhayadia R', 'Ng M', 'Issa H', 'Beyer C', 'Emmrich S', 'Schuschel K', 'Ihling C', 'Sinz A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Flasinski M', 'Regenyi EM', 'Labuhn M', 'Reinhardt D', 'Yaspo ML', 'Heckl D', 'Klusmann JH']","['Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle(Saale), Germany.', 'Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'University Hospital of Halle, Halle / Saale, Germany.', 'Hospital Tauberbischofsheim, Tauberbischofsheim, Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.', 'Center for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, Germany.', 'University Childrens Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210927,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/09/27 17:28'],"['2021/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/27 17:28 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01649-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021012231 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Sep 27. pii: S0006-4971(21)01649-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021012231.,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0988-7416', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0090-1250', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0865-9582', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9760-9618', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0537-4242', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5417-8950', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7027-4483', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1070-0727']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to estimate the individual and nationwide costs for cancer care during the first year after diagnosis among children and AYAs in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We estimated the direct health care costs for children (0-14 years old) and AYAs (15-29 years old) from the perspective of the public payer. Children and AYAs with newly diagnosed cancer between April 2016 and March 2018 were identified from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination Study Group database to calculate the cost per patient. The nationwide cost was estimated by the bottom-up approach, using stratification by age group, sex, and cancer classification, based on Population Estimates and Cancer Statistics data. RESULTS: A total of 2,939 children and 5,512 AYAs were identified. The median 1-year cost per patient after diagnosis was 2,832,840 (interquartile range, 927,490-9,222,780) JPY (in USD: median, 28,047; interquartile range, 9,183-91,310). The median 1-year cost per patient was higher in children than in AYAs in all cancer classifications. Leukemia, treatment in cancer centers, and early death as well as longer hospital stay were identified to have an impact on 1-year cost per patient after diagnosis. The 1-year nationwide cost after diagnosis was estimated as 34.83 x 10(9) JPY (344.8 x 10(6) USD).

PAF1/PD2 has also been linked to the oncogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we report that PAF1/PD2 undergoes posttranslational modification (PTM) through SUMOylation, enhancing the radiation resistance of PDAC cells. We identified that PAF1/PD2 is preferentially modified by small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO 1), and mutating the residues (K)-150 and 154 by site-directed mutagenesis reduces the SUMOylation. Interestingly, PAF1/PD2 was found to directly interact with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein in response to radiation, and inhibition of PAF1/PD2 SUMOylation at K-150/154 affects its interaction with PML. Our results demonstrate that SUMOylation of PAF1/PD2 increased in the radiated pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, inhibition of SUMOylation or PML reduces the cell growth and proliferation of PDAC cells after radiation treatment. These results suggest that SUMOylation of PAF1/PD2 interacts with PTM for PDAC cell survival. Furthermore, abolishing the SUMOylation in PDAC cells enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy. Overall, our results demonstrate a novel PTM and PAF1/PD2 interaction through SUMOylation, and inhibiting the SUMOylation of PAF1/PD2 enhance the therapeutic efficacy for PDAC.",,"['Rauth, Sanchita', 'Karmakar, Saswati', 'Shah, Ashu', 'Seshacharyulu, Parthasarathy', 'Nimmakayala, Rama Krishna', 'Ganguly, Koelina', 'Bhatia, Rakesh', 'Muniyan, Sakthivel', 'Kumar, Sushil', 'Dutta, Samikshan', 'Lin, Chi', 'Datta, Kaustubh', 'Batra, Surinder K', 'Ponnusamy, Moorthy P']","['Rauth S', 'Karmakar S', 'Shah A', 'Seshacharyulu P', 'Nimmakayala RK', 'Ganguly K', 'Bhatia R', 'Muniyan S', 'Kumar S', 'Dutta S', 'Lin C', 'Datta K', 'Batra SK', 'Ponnusamy MP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Centergrid.266813.8, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210927,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*PAF1', '*SUMO1', '*pancreatic cancer', '*polymorphonuclear leukocytes', '*radiation resistance', '*sumoylation']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/09/27 17:15'],"['2022/05/22 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/27 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.00135-21 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2021 Nov 22;41(12):e0013521. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00135-21.

We performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of the mutational landscapes and their correlation with CHIP-related (clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential) mutations and patient age of 122 genes in 3096 cases of 28 different hematological malignancies. Differences were observed regarding (1) the median number of mutations (highest, median n = 4; lowest, n = 0); (2) specificity of certain mutations (high frequencies in atypical chronic myeloid leukemia [aCML; ASXL1, 86%], follicular lymphoma [FL; KMT2D, 87%; CREBBP, 73%], hairy cell lymphoma [BRAF, 100%], lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma [MYD88, 98%; CXCR4, 51%], myeloproliferative neoplasm [MPN; AK2, 68%]); (3) distribution of mutations (broad distribution within/across the myeloid/lymphoid lineage for TET2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, TP53, BCOR, and ETV6); (4) correlation of mutations with patient's age (correlated with older age across entities: TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, TP53, EZH2, BCOR, GATA2, and IDH2; younger age: KIT, POT1, RAD21, U2AF2, and WT1); (5) correlation of mutation number per patient with age. Moreover, we observed high frequencies of mutations in RUNX1, SRSF2, IDH2, NRAS, and EZH2 in cases comprising at least 1 DTA (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1) mutation, whereas in cases without DTA mutations, TP53, KRAS, WT1, and SF3B1 were more frequent across entities, suggesting differences in pathophysiology. These results give further insight into the complex genetic landscape and the role of DTA mutations in hematological neoplasms and define mutation-driven entities (myelodysplastic syndrome/MPN overlap; secondary acute myeloid) in comparison with entities defined by chromosomal fusions (chronic myeloid leukemia; myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia).","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

These FET family fusion proteins typically harbor a low-complexity domain (LCD) of FET protein at their N-terminus and a DNA-binding domain (DBD) at their C-terminus. EWS-FLI1 has been confirmed to form biomolecular condensates at its target binding loci due to LCD-LCD and LCD-DBD interactions, and these condensates can recruit RNA polymerase II to enhance gene transcription. However, how these condensates are assembled at their binding sites remains unclear.

This loss can be valued and provides a measure of the cancer burden. We estimated paid and unpaid productivity lost due to cancer-related premature mortality in 31 European countries in 2018. Lost productivity was estimated for all cancers combined and 23 cancer sites, overall, by region and country. Deaths aged 15 to 64 were abstracted from GLOBOCAN 2018. Unpaid time lost (housework, caring, volunteering) was derived from Eurostat. Paid and unpaid productivity losses were valued using the human capital approach. In total, 347,149 premature cancer deaths occurred (60% male). The total value of cancer-related lost productivity was euro104.6 billion. Of this, euro52.9 billion (50.6%) was due to lost paid work, and euro51.7 billion (49.4%) to unpaid work. Females accounted for 36.7% of paid work costs but half (51.1%) of the unpaid work costs. Costs were highest in Western Europe (euro52.0 billion). The most costly cancer was lung (euro21.7 billion), followed by breast (euro10.6 billion). The average loss per premature death was highest for Hodgkin's lymphoma (euro506 345), melanoma (euro450 694), brain cancer (euro428 449) and leukaemia (euro378 750). Cancer-related lost productivity costs are significant. Almost half are due to unpaid work losses, indicating the importance of considering both paid and unpaid labour in assessing the cancer economic burden.

Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been considered as potential diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic factors in different human malignancies including AML. Altered expression of lncRNAs is correlated with the transformation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into leukemic blast cells because of their distinct role in the key cellular processes. We discuss the significant role of lncRNAs in the proliferation, survival, differentiation, leukemic stem cells in AML and their involvement in different molecular pathways (insulin-like growth factor type I receptor, FLT3, c-KIT, Wnt, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase-B, microRNAs), and associated mechanisms such as autophagy, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism.

Diagnosis of NL is challenging, as the entity can mimic neuropathies of more common etiologies, and an adequate biopsy may be difficult to obtain. Timely diagnosis demands a high index of suspicion, especially for patients without a history of hematologic malignancy. We expand upon a unique case of NL exclusively involving cranial nerves and cauda equina nerve roots, as the initial manifestation of ENKTL, and contextualize our findings within the framework of previously reported NK/T-lineage NL cases.","['(c) 2021 S.

This risk is especially important in geographical regions like Asia where many potential therapy recipients have HBV infection. Also, whether safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in Asians and Europeans with advanced CLL/SLL are similar is unknown. We determined the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib compared with rituximab in advanced CLL/SLL including persons with HBV infection. We compared outcomes with data published from trials in persons of European descent. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of a multicenter, phase-3 trial (NCT01973387). Subjects with advanced CLL/SLL were randomized 2:1 to receive ibrutinib, 420 mg/day, or rituximab, 500 mg/mE + 2, for 6 cycles. Subjects with resolved HBV infection were included. Endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), survival, and adverse events including resolved HBV reactivation. RESULTS: 131 subjects received ibrutinib (N = 87) or rituximab (N = 44) including 53 with resolved HBV infection. Median follow-up was 31 months (95% confidence interval: 28, 32 months). ORR was 61% (50, 71%) versus 7% (2, 18%; p < 0.001). Median PFS was not reached in the ibrutinib cohort but must be >40 months versus 8 months (7, 9 months; p < 0.0001) in the rituximab cohort. Median survival was not reached but must be >40 months versus 27 months (17 months, NE; p = 0.0006). In multivariable analyses, receiving ibrutinib increased PFS (hazard rate [HR] for failure = 0.12 [0.06, 0.23]; p < 0.001) and decreased risk of death (HR = 0.31 [0.15, 0.63]; p < 0.001). Median duration of exposure to ibrutinib was significantly longer than exposure to rituximab (28 vs. 5 months). The safety profile of ibrutinib was consistent with that observed in previous studies with no new safety signal. No subject receiving ibrutinib had HBV reactivation versus 2 receiving rituximab, despite much greater use of drugs to prevent HBV reactivation in the rituximab cohort. Outcomes were like those reported in persons of European descent, except ORR which, was unreliably correlated with PFS in Asians. CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib is safe and effective in persons with advanced CLL/SLL and better than rituximab in all therapy outcomes including risk of HBV reactivation. Outcomes with ibrutinib in Chinese were like those reported in persons of predominately European descent.","['(c) 2021 S.

This study assessed treatment outcomes of children presenting with ALL and evaluated perspectives of health-care providers (HCP) on ALL treatment at a Kenyan academic hospital. METHODS: This was a combined retrospective medical records and cross-sectional questionnaire study. Treatment outcomes of 136 children diagnosed with ALL between 2010 and 2016 were collected. Questionnaires were completed by 245 HCP (response rate, 86%) between September and October 2016. RESULTS: Childhood ALL treatment outcomes were death (30%), progressive or relapsed disease (26%), abandonment (24%), and event-free survival (20%). Of all deaths, 80% were early deaths (prior or during induction), whereas 20% occurred in remission. Probability of event-free survival at three years was 18%. Only 57% of HCP believed childhood ALL can be cured, with more doctors (96%) than other HCP (45%) believing in curability of ALL (P < 0.001). The majority of HCP (96%) thought that experienced doctors should put more time and effort into making parents understand the diagnosis and necessity to complete treatment. According to HCP, reasons for protocol nonadherence included parental financial difficulties (94%) and use of alternative treatment (79%). CONCLUSIONS: Event-free survival for ALL in Kenya is low. The primary reason for treatment failure is early death from treatment-related complications. More efforts should be directed toward improving supportive care strategies. In the opinion of HCPs, improved communication with parents and supervision of junior staff will improve ALL treatment outcomes.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Olbara, Gilbert', 'van der Wijk, Thyra', 'Njuguna, Festus', 'Langat, Sandra', 'Mwangi, Henry', 'Skiles, Jodi', 'Vik, Terrry A', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Mostert, Saskia']","['Olbara G', 'van der Wijk T', 'Njuguna F', 'Langat S', 'Mwangi H', 'Skiles J', 'Vik TA', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Mostert S']","['Department of Child Health and Pediatrics, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, Kenya.', ""Emma's Children Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrjie Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Child Health and Pediatrics, Moi University, School of Medicine, Eldoret, Kenya.', 'Department of Child Health and Pediatrics, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, Kenya.', 'Department of Health Information Management, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, Kenya.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Child Health and Pediatrics, Moi University, School of Medicine, Eldoret, Kenya.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', ""Emma's Children Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrjie Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Emma's Children Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrjie Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210926,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,,2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/09/27 06:41'],"['2021/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/27 06:41 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29366 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec;68(12):e29366. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29366.

Twenty-six AML patients who relapsed after allo-HSCT were enrolled and treated with venetoclax plus azacitidine and DLI. Complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), and objective remission rate (ORR) were assessed, and then event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Besides, adverse events were documented. Additionally, whole exome sequencing was performed in bone marrow samples. The CRi, PR, and ORR rates were 26.9%, 34.6%, and 61.5%, respectively. The median time of EFS and OS was 120 (95% CI: 71-610) days and 284.5 (95% CI: 81-610) days, respectively. The most common adverse events were hematologic system adverse events including agranulocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, while the adverse events of other systems were relatively less and milder. In addition, no serious adverse events existed. Of note, there were 6 (23.1%) patients who developed GVHD. As for gene mutation, 49 mutated genes were found, which were categorized as first-, second-, and third-class mutations, and then further analysis revealed that the first-class mutations were not correlated with EFS or OS. Additionally, the most frequent mutated genes were FLT3, CEBPA, DNMT3A, KIT, KRAS, and NRAS.

Both strategies revealed regulators of monocytic differentiation, SPI1, JUNB, FOS, and aryl-hydrocarbon receptor signaling (AHR/ARNT), as determinants of BETi response. AHR activation synergized with BETi while inhibition antagonized BETi-mediated cytotoxicity. Consistent with BETi sensitivity dependence on monocytic differentiation, ex vivo sensitivity to BETi in primary AML patient samples correlated with higher expression of monocytic markers CSF1R, LILRs, and VCAN. In addition, HL-60 cell line differentiation enhanced its sensitivity to BETi. Further, screens to rescue BETi sensitivity identified BCL2 and CDK6 as druggable vulnerabilities. Finally, monocytic AML patient samples refractory to venetoclax ex vivo were significantly more sensitive to combined BETi + venetoclax. Together, our work highlights mechanisms that could predict BETi response and identifies combination strategies to overcome resistance.",,"['Romine, Kyle A', 'Nechiporuk, Tamilla', 'Bottomly, Daniel', 'Jeng, Sophia', 'McWeeney, Shannon K', 'Kaempf, Andy', 'Corces, M Ryan', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W']","['Romine KA', 'Nechiporuk T', 'Bottomly D', 'Jeng S', 'McWeeney SK', 'Kaempf A', 'Corces MR', 'Majeti R', 'Tyner JW']","['Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, Portland, Oregon.', 'Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Portland, Oregon.', 'Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon. tynerj@ohsu.edu.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210701,United States,Blood Cancer Discov,Blood cancer discovery,101764786,,,,2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:01,['2021/09/27 06:24'],"['2021/09/27 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-21-0012 [doi]', '2643-3230.BCD-21-0012 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cancer Discov. 2021 Sep;2(5):518-531. doi: 10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-21-0012.

However, this new armamentarium of therapies faces an old problem: choosing the right treatment for each patient. The lack of predictive biomarkers is particularly worrying for pediatric patients since it impairs the implementation of new treatments in the clinic. In this study, we used the functional assay dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP) to evaluate two new treatments for BCP-ALL that could improve clinical outcome, especially for relapsed patients. We found that the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib exquisitely increased apoptotic priming in an NRAS-mutant and in a KMT2A-rearranged cell line presenting a high expression of FLT3, respectively. Following these observations, we sought to study potential adaptations to these treatments. Indeed, we identified with DBP anti-apoptotic changes in the BCL-2 family after treatment, particularly involving MCL-1 - a pro-survival strategy previously observed in adult cancers. To overcome this adaptation, we employed the BH3 mimetic S63845, a specific MCL-1 inhibitor, and evaluated its sequential addition to both kinase inhibitors to overcome resistance. We observed that the metronomic combination of both drugs with S63845 was synergistic and showed an increased efficacy compared to single agents. Similar observations were made in BCP-ALL KMT2A-rearranged PDX cells in response to sunitinib, showing an analogous DBP profile to the SEM cell line. These findings demonstrate that rational sequences of targeted agents with BH3 mimetics, now extensively explored in clinical trials, may improve treatment effectiveness by overcoming anti-apoptotic adaptations in BCP-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Manzano-Munoz, Alcon, Menendez, Ramirez, Seyfried, Debatin,', 'Meyer, Samitier and Montero.']","['Manzano-Munoz, Albert', 'Alcon, Clara', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Ramirez, Manuel', 'Seyfried, Felix', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Meyer, Luder H', 'Samitier, Josep', 'Montero, Joan']","['Manzano-Munoz A', 'Alcon C', 'Menendez P', 'Ramirez M', 'Seyfried F', 'Debatin KM', 'Meyer LH', 'Samitier J', 'Montero J']","['Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Stem Cell Biology, Developmental Leukemia and Immunotherapy, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute-Campus Clinic, Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Nino Jesus University Children's Hospital, Madrid, Spain."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Electronics and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Physics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Networking Biomedical Research Center in Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210909,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['BH3 mimetics', 'apoptosis', 'pediatric leukemia', 'resistance', 'targeted therapies']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:01,['2021/09/27 06:17'],"['2021/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/27 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.695225 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Sep 9;9:695225. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.695225. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['JM reports previous consulting for Vivid Biosciences and Oncoheroes Biosciences,', 'and his laboratory is currently collaborating with AstraZeneca.

Aspirin (ASA), an anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to exert anticancer activity. Herein, we investigated the effect of CDM combined with ASA on myelodysplastic syndromes-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML-MDS) cells and explored the underlying mechanism. The putative targets of CDM and ASA were predicted by network pharmacology approach. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed by DAVID. Furthermore, experimental validation was conducted by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Flow cytometry and Western blotting. Network pharmacology analysis revealed 36 AML-MDS-related overlapping genes that were targets of CDM and ASA, while 10 hub genes were identified by the plug-in cytoHubba in Cytoscape. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated CDM and ASA significantly affected PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Functional experiments demonstrated that the combination of CDM and ASA had a remarkable synergistic anti-proliferative effect by blocking the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase and inducing apoptosis. Mechanistically, the combination treatment significantly down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT. In addition, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), an activator of PI3K/AKT pathway, reversed the effects of the combination treatment. Our findings suggested that CDM combined with ASA exerted a synergetic inhibitory effect on cell growth by inactivating PI3K/AKT pathway, which might pave the way for effective treatments of AML-MDS.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Liang, Zhou, Cai, Rodrigues-Lima, Chi and Wang.']","['Liang, Simin', 'Zhou, Xiaojia', 'Cai, Duo', 'Rodrigues-Lima, Fernando', 'Chi, Jianxiang', 'Wang, Li']","['Liang S', 'Zhou X', 'Cai D', 'Rodrigues-Lima F', 'Chi J', 'Wang L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Universite de Paris, Unite de Biologie Fonctionnelle et Adaptative, CNRS UMR 8251, Paris, France.', 'Center for the Study of Hematological Malignancies, Karaiskakio Foundation, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210909,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K/Akt pathway', 'aspirin', 'chidamide', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'network pharmacology']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:01,['2021/09/27 06:17'],"['2021/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/27 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.685954 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Sep 9;9:685954. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.685954. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8458633,,,,,,,,,,

According to the guidelines, it must be done before the patient receives chemotherapy. A 22-year-old girl with acute lymphocytic leukemia was a candidate for ovarian cryopreservation after 6 months of chemotherapy. Despite chemotherapy, the anti-Mullerian hormone survey was within normal range. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation was done. In the histology survey, follicular density was 7.48. This case shows that only having a history of chemotherapy does not exclude the patient from the fertility preservation program. Regarding referring the patients for fertility preservation, cumulative factors such as a history of gonadotoxic treatment, age, and treatment protocol should be considered. In addition, the case was negative for assessing of CD45 marker.

Cytokine signal-transduction inhibitor molecule 3 (SOCS3) is an important negative regulator of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and plays certain roles in ALV-J infection. It is of significance to confirm the roles of SOCS3 in ALV-J infection and study how this gene affects ALV-J infection. In this study, we assessed the expression of the SOCS3 gene in vivo and in vitro, and investigated the roles of SOCS3 in ALV-J infection using overexpressed or interfered assays with the SOCS3 in DF-1 cells. The results showed that the SOCS3 expression of ALV-J infected chickens was different from uninfected chickens in the spleen, thymus and cecal tonsil. Further, SOCS3 is mainly expressed in the nucleus as determined by immunofluorescence assay. Overexpression of SOCS3 in DF-1 cells promoted the replication of ALV-J virus, and the expression of interferons (IFNalpha and INFbeta), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNFalpha) along with interferon-stimulating genes (CH25H, MX1, OASL, and ZAP). Conversely, interference of SOCS3 showed the opposite results. We also observed that SOCS3 promoted ALV-J virus replication by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation. In conclusion, SOCS3 promotes ALV-J replication via inhibiting the phosphorylation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These results would advance further understanding of the persistent infection and the viral immune evasion of the ALV-J virus.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Mo, Fu, Hu, Zhang, Xian, Zhang, Lin, Shi, Nie and Zhang.']","['Mo, Guodong', 'Fu, Huali', 'Hu, Bowen', 'Zhang, Qihong', 'Xian, Mingjian', 'Zhang, Zihao', 'Lin, Ling', 'Shi, Meiqing', 'Nie, Qinghua', 'Zhang, Xiquan']","['Mo G', 'Fu H', 'Hu B', 'Zhang Q', 'Xian M', 'Zhang Z', 'Lin L', 'Shi M', 'Nie Q', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.', 'Division of Immunology, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of AgroAnimal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210910,Switzerland,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,101585359,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALV-J', '*JAK2/STAT3', '*SOCS3', '*chicken', '*immune']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/09/27 06:16'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/27 06:16 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcimb.2021.748795 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2021 Sep 10;11:748795. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2021.748795. eCollection 2021.,20211020,,"['Animals', '*Avian Leukosis', '*Avian Leukosis Virus', 'Chickens', 'Phosphorylation', '*Poultry Diseases', 'Virus Replication']",,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8461107,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between MYBL2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ALL risk in children. Methods: A total of 687 pediatric ALL cases and 971 cancer-free controls from two hospitals in South China were recruited. A case-control study by genotyping three SNPs in the MYBL2 gene (rs285162 C>T, rs285207 A>C, and rs2070235 A>G) was conducted. The associations were assessed by odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup and stratification analyses were conducted to explore the association of rs285207 with ALL risk in terms of age, sex, immunophenotype, risk level, and other clinical characteristics. The false-positive report probability (FPRP) analysis was performed to verify each significant finding. Functional analysis in silico was used to evaluate the probability that rs285207 might influence the regulation of MYBL2 . Results: Our study demonstrated that rs285207 was related to a decreased ALL risk (adjusted OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.63-0.97, P = 0.022) in the dominant model. The associations of rs285207 with ALL risk appeared stronger in patients with pre B ALL (adjusted OR=0.56; 95% CI=0.38-0.84, P=0.004), with normal diploid (adjusted OR=0.73; 95% CI=0.57-0.95, P=0.017), with low risk (adjusted OR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.94, P=0.021), with lower WBC (adjusted OR=0.62; 95% CI=0.43-0.87, P=0.007) or lower platelet level (adjusted OR=0.76; 95% CI=0.59-0.96, P=0.023). With FPRP analysis, the significant association between the rs285207 polymorphism and decreased ALL risk was still noteworthy (FPRP=0.128). Functional analysis showed that IKZF1 bound to DNA motif overlapping rs285207 and had a higher preference for the risk allele A. As for rs285162 C>T and rs2070235 A>G, no significant was found between them and ALL risk. Conclusion: In this study, we revealed that rs285207 polymorphism decreased the ALL risk in children, and rs285207 might alter the binding to IKZF1, which indicated that the MYBL2 gene polymorphism might be a potential biomarker of childhood ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Guo, Li, Sun, Wu, Deng, Xu and Yang.']","['Guo, Haixia', 'Li, Na', 'Sun, Yaping', 'Wu, Cuiling', 'Deng, Huixia', 'Xu, Ling', 'Yang, Xu']","['Guo H', 'Li N', 'Sun Y', 'Wu C', 'Deng H', 'Xu L', 'Yang X']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Systems Biology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen, China.', 'Institute of Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210908,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['IKZF1', 'MYBL2', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'children', 'single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)', 'susceptibility']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:01,['2021/09/27 06:15'],"['2021/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/27 06:15 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.734588 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 8;11:734588. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.734588. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8456030,,,,,,,,,,

The two blood tumor entities were clonally unrelated. LyP presented with a diffuse (>90% body surface area) cutaneous rash and was characterized by intensely pruriginous dusky nodules (n = 10) and red flat-topped papules (n = 60). No response to topical corticosteroids and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy was observed. In order to effectively treat progressive TP53-mutated CLL, the potent BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax, was initiated with no treatment-related complications. While CLL only achieved a partial response, a complete remission of LyP-associated cutaneous rash and of the intractable pruritus was obtained within 2 months from venetoclax initiation. BCL2 immunostaining of the original cutaneous specimen showed a strong over-expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, restricted to CD30(+) lymphoid cells and reactive microenvironment. At 12 months follow-up, the patient is still in complete remission of LyP. Our findings underline the probable pathogenic role of BCL2 in LyP and the potential therapeutic efficacy of venetoclax for the treatment of this primary cutaneous CD30(+) lymphoproliferative disorder, especially in the setting of severe and refractory disease.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Guarente, Martino, Dorillo, De Falco, Rompietti, Sorcini,', 'Brogna, Cardinali, Ascani, Marra and Sportoletti.']","['Guarente, Valerio', 'Martino, Giovanni', 'Dorillo, Erica', 'De Falco, Filomena', 'Rompietti, Chiara', 'Sorcini, Daniele', 'Brogna, Mariangela', 'Cardinali, Valeria', 'Ascani, Stefano', 'Marra, Andrea', 'Sportoletti, Paolo']","['Guarente V', 'Martino G', 'Dorillo E', 'De Falco F', 'Rompietti C', 'Sorcini D', 'Brogna M', 'Cardinali V', 'Ascani S', 'Marra A', 'Sportoletti P']","['Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210909,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell lymphoma', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP)', 'lymphomatoid papulosis treatment', 'venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor)']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:01,['2021/09/27 06:15'],"['2021/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/27 06:15 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.729106 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 9;11:729106. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.729106. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8459905,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods: A total of 808 pediatric ALL cases and 1,340 cancer-free controls from five hospitals in South China were recruited. A case-control study by genotyping three SNPs in the METTL3 gene was conducted. Genomic DNA was abstracted from peripheral blood. Three SNPs (rs1263801 C>G, rs1139130 A>G, and rs1061027 A>C) in the METTL3 gene were chosen to be detected by taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Results: That rs1263801 C>G, rs1139130 A>G, and rs1061027 A>C polymorphisms were significantly associated with increased pediatric ALL risk was identified. In stratification analyses, it was discovered that rs1263801 CC, rs1061027 AA, and rs1139130 GG carriers were more likely to develop ALL in subgroups of common B-ALL, MLL gene fusion. Rs1263801 CC and rs10610257 AA carriers were more possible to increase the risk of ALL in subgroups of low hyperdiploid, and all of these three SNPs exhibited a trend toward the risk of ALL. All of these three polymorphisms were associated with the primitive/naive lymphocytes and MRD in marrow after chemotherapy in ALL children. Rs1263801 CC and rs1139130 AA alleles provided a protective effect on MRD >/=0.01% among CCCG-treated children. As for rs1139130, AA alleles provided a protective effect on MRD in marrow >/=0.01% on 33 days and 12 weeks among CCCG-treated children, but provided a risk effect on MRD in the marrow >/=0.01% among SCCLG-treated children. As for rs1263801 CC and rs1139130 AA, these two alleles provided a protective effect on MRD in the marrow >/=0.01% among CCCG-treated children. Conclusion: In this study, we revealed that METTL3 gene polymorphisms were associated with increased pediatric ALL risk and indicated that METTL3 gene polymorphisms might be a potential biomarker for choosing ALL chemotherapeutics.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Huang, Huang, Yang, Yang, Luo, Cai, Wu, Liu, Yan, Wen,', 'Cai, Xu and Jiang.']","['Liu, Xiaoping', 'Huang, Libin', 'Huang, Ke', 'Yang, Lihua', 'Yang, Xu', 'Luo, Ailing', 'Cai, Mansi', 'Wu, Xuedong', 'Liu, Xiaodan', 'Yan, Yaping', 'Wen, Jianyun', 'Cai, Yun', 'Xu, Ling', 'Jiang, Hua']","['Liu X', 'Huang L', 'Huang K', 'Yang L', 'Yang X', 'Luo A', 'Cai M', 'Wu X', 'Liu X', 'Yan Y', 'Wen J', 'Cai Y', 'Xu L', 'Jiang H']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Pediatrics Department, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Pediatric Center of Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Division of Birth Cohort Study, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210909,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoid leukemia', 'methyltransferase-like 3', 'pediatric', 'polymorphism', 'susceptibility']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:01,['2021/09/27 06:15'],"['2020/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/27 06:15 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.635251 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 9;11:635251. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.635251. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8459019,,,,,,,,,,

NK cells exhibit their function through a complex collection of receptors that act synergistically to recognize, regulate, or amplify the immune response. TLRs allow cells to detect PAMPs, MAMPs, or DAMPs, which are essential for the initiation of the immune response. Studies on the different subpopulations of NK cells and their expression profile of innate immune receptors in hematological cancers are limited. In this study, the specific subpopulations of NK cells in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the repertoire and level of expression of TLRs in cytotoxic NK cells were assessed. The results suggested that pediatric patients with ALL exhibited a significant decrease in NK cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow, in addition to alterations in the distribution of the subpopulations of cells. Regulatory and cytotoxic NK cells were diminished, whereas dysfunctional phenotype was considerably increased. Cytotoxic NK cells from children with ALL expressed all 10 TLRs, and expression of TLR1 and TLR9 was decreased compared with the controls. Interestingly, cytotoxic NK cells exhibited a higher expression of TLR1 in the bone marrow than in the peripheral blood of patients with ALL. The present study is the first to show that TLR10 was expressed in the cytotoxic NK cells and the first to assess the profile and levels of the 10 known TLRs in cytotoxic NK cells from patients with ALL.

Traditional treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, while successful in the early disease stages, are ineffective in patients with metastases and relapses who often have poor prognosis. Therefore, new treatments for EWS are needed to improve patient's outcomes. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells therapy, a novel adoptive immunotherapy, has been developing over the past few decades, and is increasingly popular in researches and treatments of various cancers. CAR-T cell therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma.

This study was designed to characterize the genomic features of a carbapenem-resistant K. oxytoca strain and analyze its molecular characteristics. Materials and Methods: The strain wzx-IMP was isolated from the blood of a 2-year-old girl diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia-M7. Species identification was performed, and the minimal inhibitory concentration of the strain was measured. Multilocus sequence typing was performed to identify the subtypes of K. oxytoca. The transfer capacity of the blaIMP-4-harboring plasmid was investigated by conjugation experiments, and the genome characteristics of the strain were examined using whole-genome sequencing. Results: wzx-IMP belongs to the ST85 type and is resistant to imipenem and meropenem, which harbored the blaIMP-4 gene. The blaIMP-4 gene was located in an IS26-associated class 1 integron of pwzx_IMP, which contains conserved IncN1-type backbone regions with a replication gene and its accessory structure for plasmid replication. The blaIMP-4-carrying plasmid in wzx-IMP was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli EC600 by conjugation. Whole-genome sequencing showed that the wzx-IMP isolate included the blaOXY-1-1 gene, accompanied by OmpK36 absence.

Here, we want to clarify the impact of hypoxia on the proliferation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) cells and the response to chemotherapy. METHODS: T-ALL cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. MTT assay and trypan blue staining technique was used to detect cell viability and proliferation. In vitro sensitivity to glucocorticoid was assessed by IC50. CDI was used to analyze the combined effects of glucocorticoid and hypoxia. Flow cytometry was performed to detect apoptosis and cell cycle. Western blotting was performed to detect the protein expression associated with hypoxia. RESULTS: Hypoxia of 1% O2 resulted different impact on cell viability and proliferation to different T-ALL cell lines, reduced, unaffected or induced, according to their different metabolic phenotype. All the cell lines showed an induction of key enzymes in glycolysis pathway following hypoxia exposure, although different effector proteins were induced in different cell lines. In GC-sensitive cells, acute hypoxia made no effect on the IC50 of dexamethasone, but chronic hypoxia may improve cell survival and induce GC resistance. However, acute hypoxia induced a higher GC resistance in GC-resistant T-ALL cells and showed an antagonistic effect while combined with high-dose dexamethasone. CONCLUSION: T-ALL cells adapt well to hypoxic environment. Hypoxia may influence leukaemic cell proliferation. More importantly, hypoxia contributes to GC resistance in T-ALL blasts, especially in refractory/relapsed T-ALL.",,"['Li, Yuanyuan', 'Wei, Yi', 'Gu, Ling']","['Li Y', 'Wei Y', 'Gu L']","[""Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""Joint laboratory of West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University and School of Life Science, Fudan University for Pulmonary Development and Disease, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""NHC Key Laboratory of Chronobiology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""Joint laboratory of West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University and School of Life Science, Fudan University for Pulmonary Development and Disease, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""NHC Key Laboratory of Chronobiology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'ER stress', 'glucocorticoid resistance', 'glycolysis', 'hypoxia']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/09/27 05:28'],"['2021/09/27 05:28 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1980689 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):775-784. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1980689.,20211028,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']","['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Tumor Hypoxia/drug effects']",1,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2410-1696'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on the mechanisms underlying imatinib resistance and other alternative drugs are urgently needed. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the differences in proteomics and phosphoproteomics between K562 and K562/G (imatinib resistant K562). Multiple bioinformatics analyses were performed to unveil the differential signal pathways. CCK-8 was used to detect cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cycle, and cell apoptosis. Western blotting and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to observe the changes of ROS and autophagy associated with imatinib resistance in CML. Our results indicated that ROS-autophagy formed one negative feedback loop and was associated with imatinib resistance. Additionally, the limited-rate enzymes of serine synthesis pathway were escalated in K562/G, which could contribute to the increased cyclin-dependent kinases and cell proliferation index. According to phosphoproteomics data, K562/G cells exhibited abnormal phosphorylation of splicing signals. These results revealed that it could be one useful strategy to correct metabolism shift and oxidative stress, or moderately regulate autophagy.

The occurrence rate of SCNS involvement is approximately 5% but comes with a poor prognosis ever after. However, existing risk models to predict the incidence and prognosis of these patients with SCNS involvement lack both efficiency and accuracy. Controversy has also been reported regarding which risk factor may best identify the population with a high CNS relapse rate. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 831 patients with diffused large B-cell lymphoma, diagnosed between March 2008 and June 2018 in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Beijing Cancer Hospital, and Cancer Hospital of The University of Chinese Academy of Science. Risk factors and nomogram were identified and established based on Fine and Gray's competing risk analysis. Among these patients, 55 (6.6%) of them eventually developed SCNS involvement. The 1- and 2-year incidence for SCNS involvement were 3.9% and 4.7%, respectively. The median time from de novo diagnosis to CNS relapse was 8 months, and the median overall survival of these patients was 28 months. Considering the competing mortality before SCNS involvement, Fine and Gray's competing risk model was performed to analyze the characteristics related to SCNS involvement, and identified risk factors as the multiple extranodal involvements, elevated LDH and AMC level, and the involvement of breast, adrenal gland/kidney, pulmonary and bone. Corresponding factors were integrated into the competing nomogram for SCNS involvement (c-index = 0.778). In conclusion, we present the first predictive nomogram to evaluate the risk to develop SCNS involvement in de novo DLBCL patients, which may help in both prognostic evaluation and clinical decision

Lack of Spred1 function has been associated with aberrant hematopoiesis and acute leukemias. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), Spred1 is reduced in patients with accelerated phase (AP) or blast crisis (BC) CML, thereby suggesting that deficit of this protein may contribute to disease transformation. In fact, Spred1 knockout (KO) in SCLtTA/BCR-ABL CML mice either globally, or restricted to hematopoietic cells (i.e., HSCs) or to endothelial cells (ECs), led to transformation of chronic phase (CP) CML into AP/BC CML. Upon BCR-ABL induction, all three Spred1 KO CML models showed AP/BC features. However, compared with global Spred1 KO, the AP/BC phenotypes of HSC-Spred1 KO and EC-Spred1 KO CML models were attenuated, suggesting a concurrent contribution of Spred1 deficit in multiple compartments of the leukemic bone marrow niche to the CML transformation. Spred1 KO, regardless if occurred in HSCs or in ECs, increased miR-126 in LSKs (Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+)), a population enriched in leukemic stem cells (LSCs), resulting in expansion of LSCs, likely through hyperactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway that augmented Bcl-2 expression and stability. This ultimately led to enhancement of Bcl-2-dependent oxidative phosphorylation that supported homeostasis, survival and activity of LSCs and drove AP/BC transformation.","['(c) 2021.

Sixty patients (median age 71 y, range 43-97) were identified. Median CIRS was eight (4-20). Patients had indolent CLL (n = 38), had completed (n = 12) or ongoing therapy (n = 10). Forty-six patients (77%) were hospitalized due to severe Covid-19 and 11 were admitted to ICU. Severe Covid-19 was equally distributed across subgroups irrespective of age, gender, BMI, CLL status except CIRS (p < 0.05). Fourteen patients (23%) died; age >/=75 y was the only significant risk factor (p < 0.05, multivariate analysis with limited power). Comparing month 1-6 vs 7-13 of the pandemic, deaths were numerically reduced from 32% to 18%, ICU admission from 37% to 15% whereas hospitalizations remained frequent (86% vs 71%). Seroconversion occurred in 33/40 patients (82%) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detectable at six and 12 months in 17/22 and 8/11 patients, respectively. Most (13/17) had neutralizing antibodies and 19/28 had antibodies in saliva. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells (ELISpot) were detected in 14/17 patients. Covid-19 continued to result in high admission even among consecutive and young early- stage CLL patients. A robust and durable B and/or T cell immunity was observed in most convalescents.","['(c) 2021.

To more effectively eradicate leukemia cells, simultaneous targeting of BCR-ABL1 and additional CML-related survival proteins has been proposed. Notably, several highly specific myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) inhibitors have recently entered clinical trials for various hematologic malignancies, although not for CML, reflecting the insensitivity of CML cell lines to single MCL1 inhibition. Here, we show that combining TKI (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, or asciminib) treatment with the small-molecule MCL1 inhibitor S63845 exerted strong synergistic antiviability and proapoptotic effects on CML lines and CD34+ stem/progenitor cells isolated from untreated CML patients in chronic phase. Using wild-type BCR-ABL1-harboring CML lines and their T315I-mutated sublines (generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination), we prove that the synergistic proapoptotic effect of the drug combination depended on TKI-mediated BCR-ABL1 inhibition, but not on TKI-related off-target mechanisms. Moreover, we demonstrate that colony formation of CML but not normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells became markedly reduced upon combination treatment compared to imatinib monotherapy. Our results suggest that dual targeting of MCL1 and BCR-ABL1 activity may efficiently eradicate residual CML cells without affecting normal hematopoietic stem/progenitors.",['(c) 2021.

However, little is known about the metabolic profile of patients with genetic variation-induced AML. Furthermore, the metabolites differ with disease progression. Here, metabolites in the bone marrow serum of ten patients with AML and healthy individuals were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Compared with that in healthy individuals, expression of most metabolites decreased in patients with AML; hydroxylamine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, monomethylphosphate, and ethylphosphate expression was unusually increased in the patients. We further examined serial metabolite changes across the initial diagnosis, postremission, and relapse phases. Patients with relapse showed increased metabolite expression compared with those in the diagnostic phase, confirming that patients with AML had aggressively modified leukemic cells. However, a clear difference in metabolite distribution was not observed between the diagnosis and complete remission phases, suggesting that the metabolic microenvironment did not change significantly despite complete remission.

Patient prognosis varies depending on the subtype of leukemia as well as eligibility for intensive treatment regimens and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Although significant progress has been made in the therapy of patients including novel targeted treatment approaches, there is still an urgent need to optimize treatment outcome. The most common therapy is based on the use of chemotherapeutics cytarabine and anthrayclines. Here, we studied the effect of the recently synthesized marine alkaloid 3,10-dibromofascaplysin (DBF) in myeloid leukemia cells. Unsubstituted fascaplysin was early found to affect cell cycle via inhibiting CDK4/6, thus we compared the activity of DBF and other brominated derivatives with known CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which was earlier shown to be a promising candidate to treat leukemia. Unexpectedly, the effect DBF on cell cycle differs from palbociclib. In fact, DBF induced leukemic cells apoptosis and decreased the expression of genes responsible for cancer cell survival. Simultaneously, DBF was found to activate the E2F1 transcription factor.

The benzamide derivative entinostat inhibits histone deacetylase and induces histone hyperacetylation. The purine nucleoside analogue clofarabine is FDA-approved for R/R ALL in children 1-21 years of age. Low doses of clofarabine have been reported to induce DNA hypomethylation. We conducted a phase 1 study of low dose clofarabine with escalating doses of entinostat in adults with ND or R/R ALL/ABL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adults >/=60 years with ND ALL/ABL or >/=21 years with R/R ALL/ABL received repeated cycles every 3 weeks of entinostat (4 mg, 6 mg or 8 mg orally days 1 and 8) and clofarabine (10 mg/m(2)/day IV for 5 days, days 3-7) (Arm A). Adults aged 40-59 years with ND ALL/ABL or age >/=21 years in first relapse received entinostat and clofarabine prior to traditional chemotherapy on day 11 (Arm B). Changes in DNA damage, global protein lysine acetylation, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and monocytes were measured in PBMCs before and during therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were treated at three entinostat dose levels with the maximum administered dose being entinostat 8 mg. The regimen was well tolerated with infectious and metabolic derangements more common in the older population versus the younger cohort. There was no severe hyperglycemia and no peripheral neuropathy in this small study. There were 2 deaths (1 sepsis, 1 intracranial bleed). Overall response rate was 32 %; it was 50 % for ND ALL/ABL. Entinostat increased global protein acetylation and inhibited immunosuppressive monocyte subpopulations, while clofarabine induced DNA damage in all cell subsets examined. CONCLUSION: Entinostat plus clofarabine appears to be tolerable and active in older adults with ND ALL/ABL, but less active in R/R patients. Further evaluation of this regimen in ND ALL/ABL appears warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

This study set out to screen the differential expression profile of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) by microarray and explore the underlying mechanism, biological function, and clinical significance of lncRNA in CLL cells. Compared to the lncRNA expression profiles of the control group, we picked lncRNA LEF1-AS1 for further exploration. By quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we validated that primary CLL cells harbor higher lncRNA LEF1-AS1 levels than normal B cells. In the two cell lines with stable overexpression of LEF1-AS1, expression of LEF1 elevated on RNA and protein level, proliferation rates increased, and apoptosis rates decreased. In primary CLL cells, mRNA expression of LEF1 decreased by qRT-PCR after negatively regulating the expression of LEF1-AS1. RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down demonstrated that LncRNA LEF1-AS1 and LEF1 protein could combine especially. This thesis concludes LEF1-AS1 may be an oncogenic lncRNA that regulates the target gene LEF1 by interacting with protein LEF1. However, the prognostic significance of lncRNA LEF1-AS1 in CLL patients is still unclear.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, we demonstrated in mice that the anticancer activity of pentostatin required Toll-like receptor 3, the type I interferon receptor, and T cells. Upon systemic administration of pentostatin, type I interferon is produced locally in tumors, resulting in immune cell infiltration. We combined pentostatin with immune checkpoint inhibitors and observed synergistic anti-cancer activities.

Excessive hematopoietic programmed cell death (PCD) and inflammation have been observed in the bone marrow of patients with MDS, and are thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Necroptosis is a major pathway of PCD that incites inflammation; however, the role of necroptosis in human MDS has not been extensively investigated. To assess PCD status in newly diagnosed MDS, we performed immunofluorescence staining with computational image analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded BM core biopsies using cleaved caspase-3 (apoptosis marker) and necroptosis markers (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 [RIPK1], phospho-mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein [pMLKL]). Patients with MDS, but not controls without MDS or patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia, had significantly increased expression of RIPK1 and pMLKL but not cleaved caspase-3, which was most evident in morphologically low-grade MDS (<5% BM blasts) and in MDS with low International Prognostic Scoring System risk score. RIPK1 expression highly correlated with the distribution of CD71(+) erythroid precursors but not with CD34(+) blast cells. We found that necroptosis is upregulated in early/low-grade MDS relative to control participants, warranting further study to define the role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of MDS and as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of low-grade MDS.","['Copyright (c) 2021 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

However, due to the unbalanced read distribution introduced by protein immunoprecipitation, existing reproducibility measures developed for Hi-C data are not appropriate for the analysis of HiChIP and PLAC-Seq data. Here, we present HPRep, a stratified and weighted correlation metric derived from normalized contact counts, to quantify reproducibility in HiChIP and PLAC-Seq data. We applied HPRep to multiple real datasets and demonstrate that HPRep outperforms existing reproducibility measures developed for Hi-C data. Specifically, we applied HPRep to H3K4me3 PLAC-Seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse brain tissues as well as H3K27ac HiChIP data from human lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 and leukemia cell line K562, showing that HPRep can more clearly separate among pseudo-replicates, real replicates, and non-replicates. Furthermore, in an H3K4me3 PLAC-Seq dataset consisting of 11 samples from four human brain cell types, HPRep demonstrated the expected clustering of data that could not be achieved by existing methods developed for Hi-C data, highlighting the need for a reproducibility metric tailored to HiChIP and PLAC-Seq data.",,"['Rosen, Jonathan D', 'Yang, Yuchen', 'Abnousi, Armen', 'Chen, Jiawen', 'Song, Michael', 'Jones, Ian R', 'Shen, Yin', 'Hu, Ming', 'Li, Yun']","['Rosen JD', 'Yang Y', 'Abnousi A', 'Chen J', 'Song M', 'Jones IR', 'Shen Y', 'Hu M', 'Li Y']","['Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27516, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 26514, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27516, USA.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27516, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 26514, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210917,Switzerland,Curr Issues Mol Biol,Current issues in molecular biology,100931761,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['HiChIP', 'PLAC-Seq', 'chromatin spatial organization', 'reproducibility']",2021/09/26 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2021/09/25 20:28'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/25 20:28 [entrez]', '2021/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cimb43020082 [pii]', '10.3390/cimb43020082 [doi]']",epublish,Curr Issues Mol Biol. 2021 Sep 17;43(2):1156-1170. doi: 10.3390/cimb43020082.,20220110,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys4)']","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Genome/*genetics', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6396-4219', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5977-1617', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0987-2916', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9275-4189']","['R01HL129132/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'P50HD103573/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM105785/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'U01DA052713/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1HG011585/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We present a complex case of a patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia who underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation complicated by persistent VRE bacteremia and meningitis. To optimize therapy, various blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were sent to a research laboratory for extensive susceptibility testing, pharmacokinetic analyses, and time-kill experiments. RESULTS: In vitro testing revealed resistance to all first-line treatment options and CSF sampling demonstrated sub-optimal central nervous system concentrations achieved by each antimicrobial agent administered in relation to their respective MIC value. Time-kill analyses at observed CSF concentrations confirmed the lack of bactericidal activity despite use of a four-drug combination regimen. CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first to report CSF concentrations of oritavancin and tedizolid in humans and adds to the limited data regarding in vitro susceptibility of new antimicrobial agents such as eravacycline, omadacycline, and lefamulin against VRE.

Clinically, these large alterations are assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for risk stratification at diagnosis. Secondary focal events, including indels and single-nucleotide variants, are also reported; however, their clinical correlates are poorly described, and FISH has insufficient resolution to assess many of them. This study examined the exonic sequences of 26 genes reported to be mutated in >1% of patients with myeloma using a custom panel. These exons were sequenced to approximately 1000 times in a cohort of 76 patients from Atlantic Canada with detailed clinical correlates and in four multiple myeloma cell lines. Across the 76 patients, 255 mutations and 33 focal copy number variations were identified. High-severity mutations and mutations predicted by FATHMM-XF to be pathogenic identified patients with significantly reduced progression-free survival. These mutations were mutually exclusive from the Revised International Staging System high-risk FISH markers and were independent of all biochemical parameters of the Revised International Staging System. Applying our panel to patients classified by FISH to be standard risk successfully reclassified patients into high- and standard-risk groups. Furthermore, three patients in our cohort each had two high-risk markers; two of these patients developed plasma cell leukemia, a rare and severe clinical sequela of multiple myeloma.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

For example, marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) can be difficult to rule-in, in large part because no widely-used, sensitive, and specific biomarker is available for the marginal zone cell of origin. In this study, it was hypothesized that DNA methylation array profiling can assist with the classification of SBCLs, including MZLs. Extramedullary SBCLs, including challenging cases, were reviewed internally for pathology consensus and profiled. By combining the resulting array data set with data sets from other groups, a set of 26 informative probes was selected and used to train machine learning models to classify 4 common SBCLs: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and MZL. Prediction probability cutoff was used to separate classifiable from unclassifiable cases, and show that the trained model was able to classify 95% of independent test cases (n = 264/279). The concordance between model predictions and pathology diagnoses was 99.6% (n = 262/263) among classifiable test cases. One validation reference test case was reclassified based on model prediction. The model was also used to predict the diagnoses of two challenging SBCLs. Although the differential examined and data on difficult cases are limited, these results support accurate methylation-based classification of SBCLs. Furthermore, high specificities of predictions suggest that methylation signatures can be used to rule-in MZLs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

METHODS: Blood counts, aminotransferase levels and prescribed 6-mercaptopurine (6MP)/methotrexate (MTX) doses were compared with the protocol guidelines to assess compliance. Non-adherence to the prescribed medication was confirmed in patients with unmeasurable 6MP metabolite levels and suspected in patients with low 6MP metabolites concurrent with aminotransferase and white blood cell count within normal ranges, while potential intermittent non-adherence was defined by >1.9 fold fluctuating 6MP metabolites. RESULTS: Physicians' non-compliance with insufficient dose increments of 6MP/MTX despite white blood cell counts above the target level comprised a median of 20.1% (interquartile range 9.7-39.3%) of the observed time in maintenance therapy, yet no association to relapse was found (P = .17). Non-adherence to 6MP was confirmed in 9.8% (5 of 51 patients), suspected in an additional 9.8% (5 of 51 patients), and intermittent non-adherence was suspected in 52.6% (20 of 38 patients).

Two previous studies investigating its expression and significances in AML are partially different. In this study, we aimed to systematically characterize the genomic and immune landscape in AML patients with altered B7-H3 expression using multi-omics data in the public domain. We found significantly increased B7-H3 expression in AML compared to either other hematological malignancies or healthy controls. Clinically, high B7-H3 expression was associated with old age, TP53 mutations, wild-type WT1 and CEBPA, and the M3 and M5 FAB subtypes. Moreover, we observed that increased B7-H3 expression correlated significantly with a poor outcome of AML patients in four independent datasets. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed the enrichment of the ""EMT"" oncogenic gene signatures in high B7-H3 expressers. Further investigation suggested that B7-H3 was more likely to be associated with immune-suppressive cells (macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and Th17 cells). B7-H3 was also positively associated with a number of checkpoint genes, such as VISTA (B7-H5), CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2), and CD70.

Complications associated with CVCs are frequently encountered and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Prospective studies investigating and comparing complications of different types of CVCs in AML patients and their effects on the quality of life are limited. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study and evaluated the complications associated with the use of CVCs in adult AML patients during induction chemotherapy and evaluated quality of life outcomes as reported by the patients during and after their hospitalization. RESULTS: Fifty newly diagnosed patients with AML (median age, 59 years) who received intensive induction chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. Twenty-nine patients (58%) had a peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) placed and 21 (42%) patients received a Hickmann tunneled central catheter (TCC). Three percent of cases developed catheter-related thrombosis in PICCs and no thrombosis in TCCs. Catheter-related bloodstream infection was diagnosed in 8% of patients. CVC occlusion occurred in 44 patients (88%). The total number of occlusion events was 128; 97% of patients with PICCs and 76% of patients with TCCs (p = 0.003). All patients reported that the use of CVC simplified their course of treatment. Most patients reported similar restrictions in activity associated with TCCs and PICCs. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that thrombosis and catheter-related bloodstream infections remain important complications of CVCs in AML patients. Occlusion rates were higher with the use of PICCs and the use of CVCs impacted the quality of life.","['(c) 2021.

However, the full potential of this emerging modality is hampered in some cancer settings by a significant rate of therapeutic failure arising from the attenuated engraftment and persistence of CAR-redirected T cells, and tumor relapse following adoptive transfer. Here, we discuss an advanced strategy that facilitates post-infusion in vivo boosting of CAR T cells via CMV vaccination, to mediate durable remission of B cell malignancies by engrafting a CAR molecule onto a CMV-specific T cell. We also discuss a feasible and unique platform for the generation of the CMV-CD19CAR T cells for clinical application. This new approach would overcome multiple challenges in current CAR T cell technology including: short T cell persistence, limited duration of response, and inability to re-stimulate T cells after relapse or persistent disease.",['(c) 2021.

If each immunosuppressant differently affects natural killer (NK) cell function, the effect of KIR-ligand mismatch may be altered depending on the type of graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. To verify this hypothesis, the difference in the effect of KIR-ligand mismatch was retrospectively assessed between patients who received CBT for acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia, as well as GVHD prophylaxis comprising tacrolimus plus methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). In the MMF group (n = 1363), KIR-ligand mismatch augmented the incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM; hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; P = 0.008), which worsened overall survival (OS; HR, 1.30, P = 0.0077). In the analysis of each KIR-ligand mismatch type, HLA-C2 mismatch had a favorable effect on relapse incidence (HR, 0.56; P = 0.0043) and OS (HR, 0.72; P = 0.037) only in the MTX group. In the MMF group, HLA-A3/A11 mismatch worsened NRM (HR, 1.93; P < 0.001) and OS (HR, 1.48; P = 0.014).

These become apparent when looking at the frequency of treatment resistance leading to disease relapse in leukaemia patients. Key questions regarding the fundamental biology of the leukaemic cells, such as their metabolic dependencies, are still unresolved. Even though a majority of leukaemic cells are killed during initial treatment, persistent leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) and therapy-resistant cells are still not eradicated with current treatments, due to various mechanisms that may contribute to therapy resistance, including cellular metabolic adaptations. In fact, recent studies have shown that LSCs and treatment-resistant cells are dependent on mitochondrial metabolism, hence rendering them sensitive to inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). As a result, rewired energy metabolism in leukaemic cells is now considered an attractive therapeutic target and the significance of this process is increasingly being recognised in various haematological malignancies. Therefore, identifying and targeting aberrant metabolism in drug-resistant leukaemic cells is an imperative and a relevant strategy for the development of new therapeutic options in leukaemia. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the most recent studies that present experimental evidence on how leukaemic cells can metabolically rewire, more specifically the importance of OXPHOS in LSCs and treatment-resistant cells, and the current drugs available to target this process. We highlight that uncovering specific energy metabolism dependencies will guide the identification of new and more targeted therapeutic strategies for myeloid leukaemia.",['(c) 2021.

Frontline treatment with the purine analogue cladribine (CDA) results in a highly variable response duration. We hypothesised that analysis of the BM tumour microenvironment would identify prognostic biomarkers of response to CDA. HCL BM immunology pre and post CDA treatment and healthy controls were analysed using Digital Spatial Profiling to assess the expression of 57 proteins using an immunology panel. A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to accommodate the more complex experimental design of a spatially resolved study. Treatment with CDA was associated with the reduction in expression of HCL tumour markers (CD20, CD11c) and increased expression of myeloid markers (CD14, CD68, CD66b, ARG1). Expression of HLA-DR, STING, CTLA4, VISTA, OX40L were dysregulated pre- and post-CDA. Duration of response to treatment was associated with greater reduction in tumour burden and infiltration by CD8 T cells into the BM post-CDA. This is the first study to provide a high multiplex analysis of HCL BM microenvironment demonstrating significant immune dysregulation and identify biomarkers of response to CDA. With validation in future studies, prospective application of these biomarkers could allow early identification and increased monitoring in patients at increased relapse risk post CDA.",['(c) 2021.

The spindle assembly checkpoint complex is responsible for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis to prevent chromosomal instability. In this study, the novel role of PIGN as a regulator of the spindle assembly checkpoint was unveiled in leukemic patient cells and cell lines. Transient downregulation or ablation of PIGN resulted in impaired mitotic checkpoint activation due to the dysregulated expression of spindle assembly checkpoint-related proteins including MAD1, MAD2, BUBR1, and MPS1. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of PIGN restored the expression of MAD2. PIGN regulated the spindle assembly checkpoint by forming a complex with the spindle assembly checkpoint proteins MAD1, MAD2, and the mitotic kinase MPS1. Thus, PIGN could play a vital role in the spindle assembly checkpoint to suppress chromosomal instability associated with leukemic transformation and progression.",['(c) 2021.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the first-choice treatment. However, resistance to TKIs remains a challenge to cure CML patients. Here, we reveal that the m(6)A methyltransferase complex METTL3/METTL14 is upregulated in CML patients and that is required for proliferation of primary CML cells and CML cell lines sensitive and resistant to the TKI imatinib. We demonstrate that depletion of METTL3 strongly impairs global translation efficiency. In particular, our data show that METTL3 is crucial for the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation. Specifically, we found that METTL3 directly regulates the level of PES1 protein identified as an oncogene in several tumors. We propose a model in which nuclear METTL3/METTL14 methyltransferase complex modified nascent transcripts whose translation is enhanced by cytoplasmic localization of METTL3, independently from its catalytic activity. In conclusion, our results point to METTL3 as a novel relevant oncogene in CML and as a promising therapeutic target for TKI resistant CML.",['(c) 2021.

However, with the introduction of highly potent BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), Ph+ ALL can now be considered relatively favorable-risk acute leukemia. Considering the high rates of measurable residual disease negativity and excellent long-term survival that has been achieved with regimens incorporating later-generation TKIs and particularly with ponatinib, lower-intensity and even chemotherapy-free regimens are now being evaluated for patients of all ages with Ph+ ALL. The very encouraging early results observed with blinatumomab-based, chemotherapy-free regimens challenge previous notions that all patients with Ph+ ALL should undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission, as these regimens are capable of achieving deep and durable remissions without need for transplant in the vast majority of patients, particularly when combined with ponatinib. In this review, we discuss the evolving approach to the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL and the major principles that should guide therapy in this disease. We also review the rationale and data supporting the use of novel, chemotherapy-free regimens in Ph+ ALL, and how these approaches may soon become new standards of care.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to assess the cost of the hospital stay for the administration of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in France. Data were collected from the French Medical Information Systems Program (PMSI) and all hospital stays associated with an administrated drug encoded 9439938 (tisagenlecleucel, Kymriah(R)) or 9440456 (axicabtagene ciloleucel, Yescarta(R)) between January 2019 and December 2020 were included. 485 hospital stays associated with an injection of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells were identified, of which 44 (9%), 139 (28.7%), and 302 (62.3%) were for tisagenlecleucel in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), tisagenlecleucel in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and axicabtagene ciloleucel respectively. The lengths of the stays were 37.9, 23.8, and 25.9 days for tisagenlecleucel in ALL, tisagenlecleucel in DLBCL, and axicabtagene ciloleucel, respectively. The mean costs per hospital stay were euro 372,400 for a tisagenlecleucel in ALL, euro 342,903 for tisagenlecleucel in DLBCL, and euro 366,562 for axicabtagene ciloleucel. CAR T-cells represented more than 80% of these costs. n=13 hospitals performed CAR-T cell injections, with two hospitals accounting for more than 50% of the total number of injections. This study provides original data in a context of limited information regarding the costs of hospitalization for patients undergoing CAR-T cell treatments. In addition to the financial burden, distance may also be an important barrier for accessing CAR T-cell treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

We performed high throughput exome sequencing of matched presentation and relapsed samples from 6 cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients treated with standard remission induction chemotherapy in order to contribute with the investigation of the mutational landscape of CN-AML and clonal evolution during AML treatment. RESULT: A total of 24 and 32 somatic variants were identified in presentation and relapse samples respectively with an average of 4.0 variants per patient at presentation and 5.3 variants per patient at relapse, with SNVs being more frequent than indels at both disease stages. All patients have somatic variants in at least one gene that is frequently mutated in AML at both disease presentation and relapse, with most of these variants are classic AML and recurrent hotspot mutations including NPM1 p.W288fs, FLT3-ITD, NRAS p.G12D and IDH2 p.R140Q. In addition, we found two distinct clonal evolution patterns of relapse: (1) a leukemic clone at disease presentation acquires additional mutations and evolves into the relapse clone after the chemotherapy; (2) a leukemic clone at disease presentation persists at relapse without the addition of novel somatic mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the relapse-initiating clones may pre-exist prior to therapy, which harbor or acquire mutations that confer selective advantage during chemotherapy, resulting in clonal expansion and eventually leading to relapse.",['(c) 2021.

Durable remissions of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia have been observed following treatment with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; however, most trials have excluded patients with active CNS disease. We aimed to assess the safety and activity of CAR T-cell therapy in patients with a history of CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia. METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis, we included 195 patients (aged 1-29 years; 110 [56%] male and 85 [44%] female) with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive acute lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma from five clinical trials (Pedi CART19, 13BT022, ENSIGN, ELIANA, and 16CT022) done at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA, USA), in which participants received CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy between April 17, 2012, and April 16, 2019. The trials required control of CNS disease at enrolment and infusion and excluded treatment in the setting of acute neurological toxic effects (>grade 1 in severity) or parenchymal lesions deemed to increase the risk of neurotoxicity. 154 patients from Pedi CART19, ELIANA, ENSIGN, and 16CT022 received tisagenlecleucel and 41 patients from the 13BT022 trial received the humanised CD19-directed CAR, huCART19. We categorised patients into two strata on the basis of CNS status at relapse or within the 12 months preceding CAR T-cell infusion-either CNS-positive or CNS-negative disease. Patients with CNS-positive disease were further divided on the basis of morphological bone marrow involvement-either combined bone marrow and CNS involvement, or isolated CNS involvement. Endpoints were the proportion of patients with complete response at 28 days after infusion, Kaplan-Meier analysis of relapse-free survival and overall survival, and the incidence of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. FINDINGS: Of all 195 patients, 66 (34%) were categorised as having CNS-positive disease and 129 (66%) as having CNS-negative disease, and 43 (22%) were categorised as having isolated CNS involvement. The median length of follow-up was 39 months (IQR 25-49) in the CNS-positive stratum and 36 months (18-49) in the CNS-negative stratum. The proportion of patients in the CNS-positive stratum with a complete response at 28 days after infusion was similar to that in the CNS-negative stratum (64 [97%] of 66 vs 121 [94%] of 129; p=0.74), with no significant difference in relapse-free survival (60% [95% CI 49-74] vs 60% [51-71]; p=0.50) or overall survival (83% [75-93] vs 71% [64-79]; p=0.39) at 2 years between the two groups. Overall survival at 2 years was significantly higher in patients with isolated CNS involvement compared with those with bone marrow involvement (91% [82-100] vs 71% [64-78]; p=0.046). The incidence and severity of neurotoxicity (any grade, 53 [41%] vs 38 [58%]; grade 1, 24 [19%] vs 20 [30%]; grade 2, 14 [11%] vs 10 [15%]; grade 3, 12 [9%] vs 6 [9%], and grade 4, 3 [2%] vs 2 [3%]; p=0.20) and cytokine release syndrome (any grade, 110 [85%] vs 53 [80%]; grade 1, 12 [9%] vs 2 [3%]; grade 2, 61 [47%] vs 38 [58%]; grade 3, 18 [14%] vs 7 [11%] and grade 4, 19 [15%] vs 6 [9%]; p=0.26) did not differ between the CNS-negative and the CNS-positive disease strata. INTERPRETATION: Tisagenlecleucel and huCART19 are active at clearing CNS disease and maintaining durable remissions in children and young adults with CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma, without increasing the risk of severe neurotoxicity; although care should be taken in the timing of therapy and disease control to mitigate this risk. These preliminary findings support the use of these CAR T-cell therapies for patients with CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia.

We aimed to investigate the potential underlying effect of Down syndrome versus the effects of adverse cancer genetics on clinical outcome. METHOD: Patients (aged 1-23 years) with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched non-Down syndrome patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (matched controls) from eight trials (DCOG ALL10 and ALL11, ANZCHOG ALL8, AIEOP-BFM ALL2009, UKALL2003, NOPHO ALL2008, CoALL 07-03, and CoALL 08-09) done between 2002 and 2018 across various countries (the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Germany) were included. Participants were matched (1:3) for clinical risk factors and genetics, including IKZF1 deletion. The primary endpoint was the comparison of MRD levels (absolute MRD levels were categorised into two groups, low [<0.0001] and high [>/=0.0001]) between patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched controls, and the secondary outcomes were comparison of long-term outcomes (event-free survival, overall survival, relapse, and treatment-related mortality [TRM]) between patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched controls. Two matched cohorts were formed: for MRD analyses and for long-term outcome analyses. For both cohorts, matching was based on induction regimen; for the long-term outcome cohort, matching also included MRD-guided treatment group. We used mixed-effect models, Cox models, and competing risk for statistical analyses. FINDINGS: Of 251 children and adolescents with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia, 136 were eligible for analyses and matched to 407 (of 8426) non-Down syndrome patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (matched controls). 113 patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia were excluded from matching in accordance with predefined rules, no match was available for two patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia. The proportion of patients with high MRD at the end of induction treatment was similar for patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (52 [38%] of 136) and matched controls (157 [39%] of 403; OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.64-1.46]; p=0.88). Patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia had a higher relapse risk than did matched controls in the IKZF1 deleted group (relapse at 5 years 37.1% [17.1-57.2] vs 13.2% [6.1-23.1]; cause-specific hazard ratio [HRcs] 4.3 [1.6-11.0]; p=0.0028), but not in the IKZF1 wild-type group (relapse at 5 years 5.8% [2.1-12.2] vs 8.1% [5.1-12.0]; HRcs 1.0 [0.5-2.1]; p=0.99). In addition to increased induction deaths (15 [6%] of 251 vs 69 [0.8%] of 8426), Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia was associated with a higher risk of post-induction TRM compared with matched controls (TRM at 5 years 12.2% [7.0-18.9] vs 2.7% [1.3-4.9]; HRcs 5.0 [2.3-10.8]; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Induction treatment is equivalently effective for patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and for matched patients without Down syndrome. Down syndrome itself provides an additional risk in individuals with IKZF1 deletions, suggesting an interplay between the germline environment and this poor risk somatic aberration. Different treatment strategies are warranted considering both inherent risk of relapse and high risk of TRM.

Unexpectedly, we discover that ERalpha is a potent non-canonical RNA-binding protein. We show that ERalpha RNA binding function is uncoupled from its activity to bind DNA and critical for breast cancer progression. Employing genome-wide cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) sequencing and a functional CRISPRi screen, we find that ERalpha-associated mRNAs sustain cancer cell fitness and elicit cellular responses to stress. Mechanistically, ERalpha controls different steps of RNA metabolism. In particular, we demonstrate that ERalpha RNA binding mediates alternative splicing of XBP1 and translation of the eIF4G2 and MCL1 mRNAs, which facilitates survival upon stress conditions and sustains tamoxifen resistance of cancer cells. ERalpha is therefore a multifaceted RNA-binding protein, and this activity transforms our knowledge of post-transcriptional regulation underlying cancer development and drug response.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The risk factors, prognosis, and outcome of patients with haematological cancers with coexistent COVID-19 need to be explored in different subsets of population. A single-institutional prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary level medical institute in North India. The clinical details of the recruited patients having haematological malignancies and diagnosed with COVID-19 between 15 March 2020 and 31 May 2021 were prospectively collected through the electronic patient database system. The outcomes with respect to 28-day and 56-day mortality and the associated risk factors for prognostication were analysed. Of the 5750 hospital admissions (inpatient and day-care) during the study period, two hundred and forty-two patients (4.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Acute leukaemia was the most common haematological malignancy, seen in 117 (48.3%) patients. Eighty-nine (36.8%) patients had moderate-to-severe COVID-19 while 153 (63.2%) patients presented with mild infection. The 28-day and 56-day mortality rates in our cohort were 13.3% and 19.8% respectively. Amongst the risk factors associated with poor outcome, the severity of COVID-19 (HR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.16-10.35; p = 0.04), presence of secondary infection (HR = 2.1, 95% CI 2.45-21.3; p = 0.023), and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (HR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-18.43; p = 0.01) were prognostically significant on multivariate log rank analysis. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not increase with haematological malignancies; however, the outcome remains poor in patients with severe COVID-19, requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation, and pre-existing bacterial/fungal infection at presentation.","['(c) 2021.

Here, we confirmed CALCRL expression as a prognostic factor in a cohort of 284 pediatric patients with AML. High CALCRL expression was independently associated with event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.57; P = .0001), overall survival (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06-2.27; P = .025), and cumulative incidence of relapse (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.49-1.96; P < .0001) when adjusting for age, white blood cell count, and genetic risk. Despite its association with leukemia stem cell signatures, CALCRL expression remained associated with all end points when compared with the 17-gene leukemic stem cell score. The strong association of CALCRL expression with the risk of relapse also in the pediatric population supports its role as novel age-independent master regulator of relapse-initiating, drug-tolerant AML cells in humans.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Peripheral vein (PV) is the most common type of blood access. When the blood vessels are not well filled and the blood flow is insufficient, the machine will appear repeated low pressure alarm or pipeline coagulation, which seriously affects the collection efficiency. A peripheral artery (PA) is utilized for drawing blood, while a peripheral vein is used for blood return, that is a way to perform apheresis. The advantages of PA are that it ensures adequate extracorporeal circulation blood flow, stable blood flow rate, simple operation, and relatively low price. However, there are very few studies on the efficacy of peripheral arterial access for HSCs collection. Therefore, this retrospective study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of PA and PV access for PBSCs collection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 150 apheresis procedures on 26 patients and 95 healthy donors collected by PV or PA access from March 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021. We compared the CD34+ cell count, collection efficiency (CE), duration of processing a single blood volume, number of low-pressure alarms, average blood flow rate and number of punctures between the two groups. Also, we analyzed adverse events. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the quality of apheresis blood components between the PA group and the PV group. The CD34+ cells collected was 274.16 +/- 216.31 x 10(6) in the PV group and 246.63 +/- 127.94 x 10(6) in the PA group. The CE in the PA group was 49.50 +/- 9.88%, higher than 42.39 +/- 14.62% in the PV group. The duration of processing a single blood volume was 90.67 +/- 15.35 min in the PV group and 79.68 +/- 10.28 min in the PA group. The number of low-pressure alarms in the PA group was 0.38 +/- 0.98, <2.42 +/- 1.76 in the PV group, and the average blood flow rate in the PA group was 59.27 +/- 2.18, higher than 54.21 +/- 3.41 in the PV group. The difference was statistically significant (P < .05). The Number of punctures was 1.35 +/- 0.75 in the PA group and 1.41 +/- 1.01 in the PV group. There was no statistically significant difference. CONCLUSION: Peripheral artery is a safe, reliable, economical, convenient, and fast vascular access, which opens a new way to the establishment of vascular access for PBSCs collection.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Tian, Min', 'Li, Xiangmin', 'Liu, Feng', 'Xu, Dongmei', 'Sun, Lanlan', 'Li, Qiuhuan', 'Ling, Yue', 'Bai, Yingxue', 'Wu, Xiaoling', 'Liu, Yun', 'Qiao, Jianhong']","['Tian M', 'Li X', 'Liu F', 'Xu D', 'Sun L', 'Li Q', 'Ling Y', 'Bai Y', 'Wu X', 'Liu Y', 'Qiao J']","['Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University &Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210924,United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['peripheral artery', 'peripheral blood stem cells', 'vascular access']",2021/09/25 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/09/24 08:53'],"['2021/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/24 08:53 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.21940 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2021 Dec;36(6):864-869. doi: 10.1002/jca.21940.

The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, therapeutic use, adverse effects, clinical use controversies, product description, and upcoming trials for myelodysplastic syndromes novel agents luspatercept-aamt and decitabine/cedazuridine are reviewed. DATA SOURCES: This review article utilized primary information obtained from both the published studies involved in the approval of luspatercept-aamt and decitabine/cedazuridine and package inserts for the respective medications. This review article utilized secondary information obtained from National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines using filters and keywords to sustain information relevancy as well as key studies using the keywords, ""luspatercept-aamt, myelodysplastic syndromes, decitabine, cedazuridine, hypomethylating agent, ASTX727"" from scholarly journal database PubMed. DATA SUMMARY: Myelodysplastic syndromes consist of myeloid clonal hemopathies with a diverse range of presentation. Until recently, there have been relatively few new therapies in the myelodysplastic syndromes treatment landscape. On April 3, 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration approved Reblozyl((R))(luspatercept-aamt), then on July 7, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved INQOVI((R)) (decitabine and cedazuridine). Luspatercept-aamt acts as a erythroid maturation agent through differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors. The safety and efficacy of luspatercept-aamt was demonstrated in the MEDALIST trial, a phase III trial in patients with very low-intermediate risk refractory myelodysplastic syndromes and ring sideroblasts. Luspatercept-aamt met both primary and secondary endpoints of transfusion independence of 8 weeks or longer and transfusion independence of 12 weeks or longer, respectively. Decitabine/cedazuridine has a unique mechanism of action in which decitabine acts as a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor promoting DNA hypomethylation and cedazuridine then prevents degradation of decitabine. The safety and efficacy of decitabine/cedazuridine was shown in the ASCERTAIN study, a phase III trial in patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The primary outcome evaluated was 5-day cumulative area under the curve between decitabine/cedazuridine and IV decitabine as well as additional outcomes including safety.

Given the low rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia, low virulence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and advent of rapid diagnostic systems, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-directed empiric therapy in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-colonized patients with neutropenic fever may be unnecessary, promoting increased antimicrobial resistance, drug-related toxicity, and cost. METHODS: Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-colonized adults admitted for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or induction therapy for acute leukemia/myeloid sarcoma with neutropenic fever were stratified by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia development and empiric vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-directed antimicrobial strategy for first neutropenic fever (Empiric Therapy vs. non-Empiric Therapy). Primary endpoints included vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-related, in-hospital, and 100-day mortality rates. Secondary outcomes included vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia incidence for first neutropenic fever and the entire hospitalization, length of stay, Clostridioides difficile infection rate, and duration and cost of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-directed therapy. RESULTS: During first neutropenic fever, 3 of 70 eligible patients (4%) developed vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia. Although all 3 (100%) were non-Empiric Therapy, no mortality (0%) occurred. Of 67 patients not developing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia, 42 (63%) received Empiric Therapy and 25 (37%) non-Empiric Therapy. Empiric Therapy had significantly greater median duration (3 days vs. 0 days; P<.001) and cost ($1604 vs. $0; P<.001) of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-directed therapy but demonstrated no significant differences in clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest Empiric Therapy may offer no clinical benefit to this population, regardless of whether vancomycin-resistant enterococcus is identified in blood culture or no pathogen is found. Such an approach may only expose the majority of patients to unnecessary vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-directed therapy and drug-related toxicities while increasing institutional drug and monitoring costs. Even in the few patients developing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia, waiting until the organism is identified in culture to start directed therapy likely makes no difference in mortality. This lack of benefit warrants consideration to potentially omit empiric vancomycin-resistant enterococcus-directed therapy in first neutropenic fever in many of these patients.",,"['Snyder, Matthew', 'Pasikhova, Yanina', 'Baluch, Aliyah']","['Snyder M', 'Pasikhova Y', 'Baluch A']","['Department of Pharmacy, 25301Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'DIvision of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pharmacy, 25301Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Oncologic Services, 25301Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['antimicrobial stewardship', 'empiric antimicrobials', 'neutropenic fever', 'vancomycin-resistant enterococcus', 'vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonization']",2021/09/25 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/09/24 08:42'],"['2021/09/24 08:42 [entrez]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10732748211045593 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2021 Jan-Dec;28:10732748211045593. doi: 10.1177/10732748211045593.,20220113,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship/organization & administration', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/economics/epidemiology/etiology', 'Body Mass Index', 'Clostridium Infections/epidemiology', 'Enterococcus', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*complications', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/economics/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sociodemographic Factors', '*Vancomycin Resistance']",,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4763-7223'],,PMC8477676,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed relevant guidelines and compiled drugs used to manage seven cancer-associated symptoms (anorexia and cachexia, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, constipation, diarrhea, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, cancer-associated fatigue, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting). Using GoodRx website, we identified the retail price (cash price at retail pharmacies) and lowest price (discounted, best-case scenario of out-of-pocket costs) for patients without insurance for each drug or formulation for a typical fill. We describe lowest prices here. RESULTS: For anorexia and cachexia, costs ranged from $5 US dollars (USD; generic olanzapine or mirtazapine tablets) to $1,156 USD (brand-name dronabinol solution) and varied widely by formulation of the same drug or dosage: for olanzapine 5 mg, $5 USD (generic tablet) to $239 USD (brand-name orally disintegrating tablet). For chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, costs of duloxetine varied from $12 USD (generic) to $529 USD (brand-name). For constipation, the cost of sennosides or polyethylene glycol was <$15 USD, whereas newer agents such as methylnaltrexone were expensive ($1,001 USD). For diarrhea, the cost of generic loperamide or diphenoxylate-atropine tablets was <$15 USD. For exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, only brand-name formulations were available, range of cost, $1,072 USD-$1,514 USD. For cancer-associated fatigue, the cost of generic dexamethasone or dexmethylphenidate was <$15 USD, whereas brand-name modafinil was more costly ($1,284 USD). For a 4-drug nausea and vomiting prophylaxis regimen, costs ranged from $181 USD to $1,430 USD. CONCLUSION: We highlight the high costs of many symptom control drugs and the wide variation in the costs of these drugs. These findings can guide patient-clinician discussions about cost-effectively managing symptoms, while promoting the use of less expensive formulations when possible.",,"['Gupta, Arjun', 'Nshuti, Leonce', 'Grewal, Udhayvir S', 'Sedhom, Ramy', 'Check, Devon K', 'Parsons, Helen M', 'Blaes, Anne H', 'Virnig, Beth A', 'Lustberg, Maryam B', 'Subbiah, Ishwaria M', 'Nipp, Ryan D', 'Dy, Sydney M', 'Dusetzina, Stacie B']","['Gupta A', 'Nshuti L', 'Grewal US', 'Sedhom R', 'Check DK', 'Parsons HM', 'Blaes AH', 'Virnig BA', 'Lustberg MB', 'Subbiah IM', 'Nipp RD', 'Dy SM', 'Dusetzina SB']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Louisiana State University, Shreveport, LA.', 'Division of Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, PA.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.', 'Division of Health Policy and Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Health Policy and Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210924,United States,JCO Oncol Pract,JCO oncology practice,101758685,IM,,,2021/09/25 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/09/24 08:40'],"['2021/09/24 08:40 [entrez]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/OP.21.00466 [doi]'],aheadofprint,JCO Oncol Pract. 2021 Sep 24:OP2100466. doi: 10.1200/OP.21.00466.,,,,,"['Devon K.

Limited data have been published about the infection risk associated with these new drugs, therefore this study analyzes the infectious complications in patients with lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) treated with monoclonal antibodies (obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, brentuximab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab), BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib), PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib) and BCL2 inhibitors (venetoclax). METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study of 458 LPD patients treated with targeted therapies in real-life setting, in 18 Spanish institutions, from the time of their commercial availability to August 2020. RESULTS: Severe infections incidence was 23% during 17-month median follow-up; cumulative incidence was higher in the first 3-6 months of targeted drug treatment and then decreased. The most frequent etiology was bacterial (54%). Nine (6%) Invasive fungal infections (IFI) were observed, in its majority in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients treated predominantly with ibrutinib. Significant risk factors for severe infection were: severe lymphopenia (p = 0.009, OR 4.7, range 1.3-1.7), combined targeted treatment vs single agent treatment (p = 0.014 OR 2.2 range 1.1-4.2) and previous rituximab (p = 0.03 OR 1.8, range 1.05-3.3). Infection-related mortality was 6%. In 22% of patients with severe infections, definitive discontinuation of the targeted drug was observed. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of patients presented severe infections during follow-up, with non-negligible attributable mortality, but infection incidence is not superior to the one observed during the chemotherapy era. In selected cases with specific risk factors for infection, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

In the present study, we analysed 67 patients with OIIA-LPDs, including 36 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-type and 19 with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)-type. After discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs, regression without relapse was achieved in 22 of 58 patients. Spontaneous regression was associated with Epstein-Barr virus positivity in DLBCL-type (P = 0.013). The 2-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) at a median follow-up of 32.4 months were 92.7% and 72.1% respectively. Furthermore, a significant difference in the 2-year PFS was seen between patients with DLBCL-type and HL-type OIIA-LPDs (81.0% vs. 40.9% respectively, P = 0.021). In targeted sequencing of 47 genes in tumour-derived DNA from 20 DLBCL-type OIIA-LPD samples, histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D; eight, 40%) and tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 14 (TNFRSF14; six, 30%) were the most frequently mutated genes. TNF alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) mutations were present in four patients (20%) with DLBCL-type OIIA-LPD. Cases with DLBCL-type OIIA-LPD harbouring TNFAIP3 mutations had shorter PFS and required early initiation of first chemotherapy. There were no significant factors for spontaneous regression or response rates according to the presence of mutations. Overall, OIIA-LPDs, especially DLBCL-types, showed favourable prognoses.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

His condition was diagnosed as high-output heart failure and primary plasma cell leukaemia after admission. Extensive bone involvement in primary plasma cell leukaemia and arteriovenous shunts in the same lesion were suspected after various imaging studies. The first cycle of chemotherapy with bortezomib, adriamycin, and dexamethasone led to remission of primary plasma cell leukaemia and improved heart failure symptoms. The patient received further chemotherapy in addition to autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and maintenance therapy and had no recurrence of pPCL or heart failure for 1 year to date. Discussion: Primary plasma cell leukaemia can be associated with high-output heart failure, which is caused by arteriovenous shunting at the lesion site with diffuse bone involvement. Imaging studies may lead to the early diagnosis of aetiology and treatment of patients with high-output heart failure associated with primary plasma cell leukaemia.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The transcription factor CEBPalpha is frequently mutated in AML patients leading to an increase in DNA methylation in many genomic locations. Previously, it has been shown that ecCEBPalpha (extra coding CEBP alpha) - a lncRNA transcribed in the same direction as CEBPalpha gene - regulates DNA methylation of CEBPalpha promoter in cis. Here, we hypothesize that ecCEBPalpha could participate in the regulation of DNA methylation in trans. Method: First, we retrieved the methylation profile of AML patients with mutated CEBPalpha locus from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We then predicted the ecCEBPalpha secondary structure in order to check the potential of ecCEBPalpha to form triplexes around CpG loci and checked if triplex formation influenced CpG methylation, genome-wide. Results: Using DNA methylation profiles of AML patients with a mutated CEBPalpha locus, we show that ecCEBPalpha could interact with DNA by forming DNA:RNA triple helices and protect regions near its binding sites from global DNA methylation. Further analysis revealed that triplex-forming oligonucleotides in ecCEBPalpha are structurally unpaired supporting the DNA-binding potential of these regions. ecCEBPalpha triplexes supported with the RNA-chromatin co-localization data are located in the promoters of leukemia-linked transcriptional factors such as MLF2. Discussion: Overall, these results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for ecCEBPalpha as a genome-wide epigenetic modulator through triple-helix formation which may provide a foundation for sequence-specific engineering of RNA for regulating methylation of specific genes.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Ogunleye AJ et al.'],"['Ogunleye, Adewale J', 'Romanova, Ekaterina', 'Medvedeva, Yulia A']","['Ogunleye AJ', 'Romanova E', 'Medvedeva YA']","['Department of Biological and Medical Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'Research Center of Biotechnology, Institute of Bioengineering, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'Department of Biological and Medical Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'Research Center of Biotechnology, Institute of Bioengineering, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210311,England,F1000Res,F1000Research,101594320,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*DNA methylation', '*Triplex', '*extra-coding CEBPalpha', '*long non coding RNA']",2021/09/28 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/09/27 06:09'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/27 06:09 [entrez]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12688/f1000research.28146.2 [doi]'],epublish,F1000Res. 2021 Mar 11;10:204. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.28146.2. eCollection 2021.,20211021,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']","['CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*RNA, Long Noncoding']",,['No competing interests were disclosed.'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-1307-0003'],,PMC8444155.2,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1980, seven subtypes of the virus have been recognized. HTLV-1 is prevalent and endemic in some regions, such as Africa, Japan, South America and Iran as the endemic regions of the HTLV-1 in the Middle East. To study HTLV-1 subtypes and routes of virus spread in Iran, phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses were performed and for as much as no previous phylogenetic studies were conducted in Tehran, we do this survey. To this purpose, the Tax region of HTLV-1 was used. Materials and Methods: In this study 100 samples were collected from blood donors in Tehran. All samples were screened for anti-HTLV-I antibodies by ELISA. Then, genomic DNA was extracted from all positive samples (10 people), and for confirmation of infection, ordinary PCR was performed for both the HBZ and LTR regions. Moreover, the Tax region was amplified and purified PCR products were sequenced and analyzed, and finally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using Mega X software. Results: Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that isolates from Iran, Japan, Brazil, and Africa are located within the extensive ""transcontinental"" subgroup A clade of HTLV-1 Cosmopolitan subtype a. The Japanese sequences are the closest to the Iranian sequences and have the most genetic similarity with them. Conclusion: Through phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses HTLV-1 strain in Tehran were characterized in Iran. The appearance of HTLV-1 in Iran was probably happened by the ancient Silk Road which linked China to Antioch.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

A growing body of evidence shows that m6A modification is involved in a variety of cell biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and self-renewal through different regulatory mechanisms. In recent years, a large number of studies have found that m6A modification play key role in the occurrence and development of tumors, such as acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, etc. As a function of m6A demethylase, FTO has attracted more and more attention in cancer. There is evidence that specific FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be significantly associated with overweight and cancer susceptibility by regulating the expression of related genes. Besides, when the expression level of FTO is altered or dysfunctional, it may be involved in the occurrence and progression of a variety of tumors as a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene, usually in an m6A-dependent manner. Further research found that FTO is involved in the development of different kinds of malignant tumors, but the mechanism is unknown. According to this review, The FTO gene's research progress in tumors is reviewed, aiming to find new targets for molecular pathological diagnosis and molecular targeted therapy of tumors.",['(c) 2021 Zheng et al.'],"['Zheng, Qing-Kang', 'Ma, Chao', 'Ullah, Irfan', 'Hu, Kang', 'Ma, Rui-Jie', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Sun, Zhi-Gang']","['Zheng QK', 'Ma C', 'Ullah I', 'Hu K', 'Ma RJ', 'Zhang N', 'Sun ZG']","[""School of Clinical Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Clinical Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Surgery, Khyber Medical University Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan.', ""School of Clinical Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, People's Republic of China."", ""Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210916,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,['NOTNLM'],"['FTO', 'FTO inhibitors', 'N6-methyladenosine', 'SNPs', 'cancers']",2021/09/25 06:00,2021/09/25 06:01,['2021/09/24 07:03'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/24 07:03 [entrez]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S329232 [doi]', '329232 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2021 Sep 16;14:4837-4846. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S329232. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],['ORCID: 0000-0003-1941-250X'],,PMC8453432,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we apply an integrated genomic approach to a murine allelic series that models the two most common mutations in AML: Flt3-ITD and Npm1c. We then deconvolute the contribution of each mutation to alterations of the epigenetic landscape and genome organization, and infer how mutations synergize in the induction of AML. Our studies demonstrate that Flt3-ITD signals to chromatin to alter the epigenetic environment and synergizes with mutations in Npm1c to alter gene expression and drive leukemia induction. These analyses also allow the identification of long-range cis-regulatory circuits, including a previously unknown superenhancer of Hoxa locus, as well as larger and more detailed gene-regulatory networks, driven by transcription factors including PU.1 and IRF8, whose importance we demonstrate through perturbation of network members.","['(c) 2021.

This approach facilitated the immune reconstitution after transplantation. IXZ significantly prolonged survival and decreased the risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) in two different murine models without hampering the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect, as confirmed by bioluminescence assays. Remarkably, the use of IXZ was related to an increase of regulatory T cells both in peripheral blood and in the GvHD target organs and a decrease of effector donor T cells. Regarding B cells, IXZ treated mice had faster recovery of B cells in PB and of pre-pro-B cells in the bone marrow.

Outside the medullary environment, adipocyte-derived MSCs (ASCs) could represent a source of functional osteoblasts. However, we recently found a defect in the osteoblastic differentiation of ASCs from myeloma patients (MM-ASCs). We examined the effects of plasma from myeloma patients at diagnosis (MM-plasmas) and in complete remission (CR-plasmas) and from healthy donors on the osteoblastic differentiation of healthy donor-derived ASCs (HD-ASCs). Osteoblastogenesis in HD-ASCs was suppressed by MM-plasmas. Seven cytokines (ANG1, ENA-78, EGF, PDGF-AA/AB/BB, and TARC) were increased in MM-plasmas and separately inhibited the osteoblastic differentiation of HD-ASCs. Comparison of MM-ASCs and HD-ASCs by RNA sequencing showed that two master genes characterizing adipocyte differentiation, CD36 and PPARgamma, were upregulated in MM-ASCs as compared to HD-ASCs. Finally, we demonstrated a significant increase in CD36 and PPARgamma expression in HD-ASCs in the presence of MM-plasmas or the seven cytokines individually, similarly as in MM-ASCs. We conclude that specific cytokines in MM-plasmas, besides the well-known DKK1, inhibit the osteoblastic differentiation of MM- and HD-ASCs with a skewing towards adipocyte differentiation.","['(c) 2021.

OBJECTIVE: To investigated the contribution of CXCL4 to SSc development by focusing on the correlation of circulatory CXCL4 levels with their peripheral vasculopathy, and the effect of CXCL4 on endothelial cell dysfunction and the potential signaling. METHODS: We measured the plasma CXCL4 levels in 58 patients with SSc, 10 patients with the very early diagnosis of SSc (VEDOSS), and 80 healthy controls (HCs). Then, CXCL4 concentrations were correlated with clinical features, especially the peripheral vasculopathy. These observations were further validated in an additional cohort. Moreover, we studied the anti-angiogenic effects of CXCL4 and the underlying downstream signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. RESULTS: Circulating CXCL4 levels were 103.62 % higher in patients with SSc and 201.51 % higher in patients with VEDOSS than matched HCs, which were confirmed in two independent cohorts. CXCL4 levels were associated with digital ulcers (DU) and nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) abnormalities in SSc. The proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs were inhibited by CXCL4 or SSc derived plasma, which reversed by CXCL4 neutralizing antibody, but failed by CXCR3 inhibitor. CXCL4 downregulated the transcription factor Friend leukaemia integration factor-1 (Fli-1) via c-Abl signaling. Furthermore, CXCL4 blocked the transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced cell proliferation of HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL4 may contribute to peripheral vasculopathy in SSc by downregulating Fli-1 via c-Abl signaling in endothelial cells and interfering angiogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

In a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory AML, combining the hypomethylating agent, azacitidine, with the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, demonstrated encouraging response rates (33%), median event-free, and overall survival, compared with a historical cohort of contemporary patients treated with azacitidine-based therapies, with an acceptable safety profile. Biomarkers of response are yet to be determined. In this study, we leveraged a multiplexed immune assay to assess the functional states of CD4+ and CD8+ cells at a single-cell level in pretherapy bone marrows in 16 patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated with azacitidine/nivolumab. Effector CD4+ but not CD8+ cells had distinct polyfunctional groups and were associated with responses and better outcomes. Further evaluation of the polyfunctional strength index composition across cell types revealed that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were the major drivers of enhanced polyfunctionality index of pretherapy CD4+ subset, whereas Granzyme B, IFN-gamma, MIP-1b, and TNF-alpha drove the nonsignificantly enhanced pretreatment Polyfunctional Strength Index of CD8+ subset in the responders. Single-cell polyfunctional assays were predictive of response in AML and may have a potential role as a biomarker in the wider sphere of immunotherapy.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

The European LeukemiaNet has defined molecular persistence at low copy number (MP-LCN) as an MRD transcript level <1% to 2% with a <1-log change between any 2 positive samples collected after the end of treatment (EOT). Because the clinical impact of MP-LCN is unknown, we sought to characterize outcomes in patients with persistent NPM1mut MRD after EOT and identify factors associated with disease progression. Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed NPM1mut AML who received >/=2 cycles of intensive chemotherapy were included if bone marrow was NPM1mut MRD positive at the EOT, and they were not transplanted in first complete remission. One hundred patients were followed for a median of 23.5 months; 42% remained free of progression at 1 year, either spontaneously achieving complete molecular remission (CRMRD-; 30%) or retaining a low-level NPM1mut transcript (12% for >/=12 months and 9% at last follow-up). Forty percent met the criteria for MP-LCN. Preemptive salvage therapy significantly prolonged relapse-free survival.

However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains uncharacterized. To address this question, we induced the most common mutation identified in JMML (Ptpn11E76K) specifically in the myeloid lineage with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) spared. These mice uniformly developed a JMML-like MPN. Importantly, HSCs in the same bone marrow (BM) microenvironment were aberrantly activated and differentiated at the expense of self-renewal. As a result, HSCs lost quiescence and became exhausted. A similar result was observed in wild-type (WT) donor HSCs when co-transplanted with Ptpn11E76K/+ BM cells into WT mice. Co-culture testing demonstrated that JMML/MPN cells robustly accelerated differentiation in mouse and human normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Cytokine profiling revealed that Ptpn11E76K/+ MPN cells produced excessive IL-1beta, but not IL-6, T NF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1alpha, or other inflammatory cytokines. Depletion of the IL-1beta receptor effectively restored HSC quiescence, normalized their pool size, and rescued them from exhaustion in Ptpn11E76K/+/IL-1R-/- double mutant mice.

Based on their complementary modes of action, ibrutinib and venetoclax are hypothesized to act in a synergistic fashion. Currently, it is unclear whether combined treatment is indeed superior to continuous single-agent treatment and what mechanisms underlie the resistance to combination treatment. In addition, the effects of such treatment on the skewed T-cell compartment characteristic of CLL are as yet unknown. In the murine Emicro-TCL1 adoptive transfer model resembling aggressive CLL, we found that combined treatment resulted in the deepest responses, with the longest duration related to a combination of decreased proliferation and increased induction of apoptosis. In addition, alterations in T-cell subsets were most prominent after combination treatment, with increased naive cells and reduced effector memory cells. Remarkably, effects of single agents but also combination treatment were eventually interrupted by relapse, and we found downregulation of BIM expression as a plausible cause of acquired drug resistance. Nevertheless, in this murine model, the combination of venetoclax and ibrutinib has increased efficacy over single agents, accompanied by a restoration of the T-cell compartment.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Mutation at the internal tandem duplication of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) is one of the most common somatic alterations in AML, associated with high relapse rates and poor survival due to the constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase and its downstream effectors, such as PI3K signaling. Thus, aberrantly activated FLT3-kinase is regarded as an attractive target for therapy for this AML subtype, and a number of small molecule inhibitors of this kinase have been identified, some of which are approved for clinical practice. Nevertheless, acquired resistance to these molecules is often observed, leading to severe clinical outcomes. Therapeutic strategies to tackle resistance include combining FLT3 inhibitors with other antileukemic agents. Here, we report on the preclinical activity of the combination of the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502 in FLT3-ITD cells.

In this study, the functions and correlation of LIF and bFGF in the development of chicken primordial follicles were examined, along with the signaling pathways including protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways. Ovarian tissues were collected from four-day-old chicks and incubated with LIF and bFGF alone or in combination for three days to observe the changes in follicular development. Results showed that there was a time-dependent correlation between the changes in expression of LIF/its receptor (LIFR) and the developmental process of primordial follicles. LIF and bFGF exerted a synergistic effect on the activation of primordial follicles. However, SC144 (an antagonist of LIFR) inhibited this stimulating action. The effect by LIF and bFGF were shown to operate at AKT and ERK signaling pathways to suppress cell apoptosis and promote proliferation (P < 0.05) via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (P < 0.05).

We conducted an 8-year-long prospective study on the diagnosis and monitoring of reactivated toxoplasmosis in paediatric HSCT recipients. The primary objective was to determine the incidence of reactivated toxoplasmosis in a setting that withholds prophylaxis until engraftment. The second objective was to identify the subgroups of HSCT recipients particularly prone to reactivation who may benefit the most from regular PCR follow-up. METHODS: Serological and qPCR screening targeting the Toxoplasma 529 bp gene was performed before HSCT, and continued by weekly monitoring after HSCT for a median time of 104 days. RESULTS: Reactivated toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in 21/104 (20.2%), predominantly in allo- (19/75) and rarely in auto-HSCT (2/29) recipients. Over 50% (14/21) of cases were diagnosed during the first month after HSCT, while awaiting engraftment without prophylaxis. Toxoplasma disease evolved in only three (14.3%, 3/21) patients, all treated by allo-HSCT. Reactivation was more frequent in patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (3/27, p 0.03) and especially, in recipients of haploidentical stem cells (10/20, p 0.005). Seronegative status of the donor (where was known) contributed to 75% (12/16) cases of reactivated toxoplasmosis after allo-HSCT. DISCUSSION: The presented results show that peripheral blood-based qPCR, both before and after HSCT, is a valuable asset for the diagnosis of reactivated toxoplasmosis, whereas the results of serology in recipients should be interpreted with caution. Weekly qPCR monitoring, at least until successful engraftment and administration of prophylaxis, allows for prompt introduction of specific treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious', 'Diseases.

Thus, discovery of novel translation initiation regulators may provide promising therapeutic targets. Here, combining Ribo-seq, mass spectrometry, and RNA-seq datasets, we discovered an oncomicropeptide, APPLE (a peptide located in ER), encoded by a non-coding RNA transcript in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APPLE is overexpressed in various subtypes of AML and confers a poor prognosis. The micropeptide is enriched in ribosomes and regulates the initiation step to enhance translation and to maintain high rates of oncoprotein synthesis. Mechanically, APPLE promotes PABPC1-eIF4G interaction and facilitates mRNA circularization and eIF4F initiation complex assembly to support a specific pro-cancer translation program. Targeting APPLE exhibited broad anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo.

METHODS: The diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), MMP-2, MMP-9 and CD34+CD38- cancer stem cells (CSCs) were assessed in bone marrow (BM) samples of 76 ALL children using Flow Cytometry analysis. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in TIMP-1 [1.52 (0.41-10) versus 0.91(0.6-1.12); respectively, p < 0.001], and CSCs CD34(+)CD38(-) [1 (0.03-18.6) versus 0.3 (0.01-1.1), p < 0.001] expression in ALL patients compared to controls. While there were no significant differences regarding MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression between the two groups. The sensitivity, specificity, area under curve (AUC) of MMP-2 were (80.3%, 53.3% and 0.568, p = 0.404), and of MMP-9 were (53.9%, 40% and 0.660, p = 0.053). While that of TIMP-1 were (78.9%, 100% and 0.892, p < 0.001), and that of CD34(+)CD38(-) CSCs were (78.9%, 73.3% and 0.855, p < 0.001). Increased TIMP-1 expression associated with the high-risk disease (p < 0.001). CD34(+)CD38(-) CSCs and MMP-2 overexpression associated with MRD at day-15, increased BM blast cell count at diagnosis and at day-15 (p < 0.05). TIMP-1 overexpression is associated with shorter DFS and OS rates (p = 0.009 and p = 0.048). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both TIMP-1 [OR: 4.224, p = 0.046], and CD34(+)CD38(-) CSCs [OR: 6.873, p = 0.005] could be potential independent diagnostic factors for pediatric ALL. CONCLUSION: TIMP-1 and CD34(+)CD38(-) CSCs could be possible useful diagnostic markers for pediatric ALL.

The effects of clinical characteristics, gene mutations and karyotype on remission rate and overall survival were investigated, as well as the effects of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on survival after remission. RESULTS: There were 39 and 10 cases achieving complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR), respectively, with CR rate of 56.5% and overall response (OR) rate of 71%. Moreover, 15 cases had no response (NR), with NR rate of 21.7%. There were 5 cases of death within 4 weeks after treatment, with early mortality rate of 7.2%. The factors of peripheral white blood cell count, bone marrow blast proportion, doubling of platelets after treatment, and co-mutation of three or more myeloid genes, significantly affected CR and OR rates, while age significantly affected OR rate.

Macrophages exhibit high phenotypic heterogeneity under both physiological and pathological conditions and are mainly divided into proinflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Furthermore, osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that arise by fusion of monocyte/macrophage-like cells, which are commonly known as bone macrophages. Emerging evidence suggests that macrophages and osteoclasts originating from myeloid progenitors lead to two competing differentiation outcomes, and they appear to play an important role in the onset, progression, and bone metastasis of solid cancers. However, little is known about their role in the development of hematological malignancies.

Multiple risk factors for SOS/VOD were identified, but it is often confused with other hepatic complications due to nonspecific clinical features. Therefore, diagnostic and severity criteria have been revised several times. The European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation suggested a new guideline that excludes the standard duration of development within 21 days, emphasizes late-onset SOS/VOD, and suggests the importance of Doppler ultrasonography. The severity criteria were further subdivided for guidance to begin active treatment using defibrotide which was approved in Korea since 2016. In a phase 3 trial, defibrotide had superior 100-day survival, compared to best available treatments (38.2% vs. 25.0%). Although several studies of SOS/VOD in Korean patients have been performed after the implementation of HCT, most involved small number of pediatric patients. Recently, the Korean Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation investigated the incidence of SOS/VOD in the Korean population, and several influential studies of adult patients were published.

However, compared to B-cell ALL, the molecular genetic makeup of B-cell LBL remains to be understood, mainly due to its rarity. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on seven patients with TCF3-PBX1-positive B-cell LBL. METHODS: WES was performed using DNA extracted from tumor specimens and paired blood samples at remission for six patients, and tumor-only analysis was performed for one patient whose remission sample was not available. For one patient, a relapsed sample was also analyzed. RESULTS: KMT2D variants and 6q LOH were found as recurrent alterations. Somatic variants of KMT2D were identified in three of the seven patients. Of note, the two patients with heterozygous nonsense variant of KMT2D were at stage III, without bone marrow infiltration. 6q LOH was also identified in two others, out of the seven patients. The common 6q deleted region of the two patients ranged from 6q12 to 6q16.3. Both patients had bone marrow infiltration. Analysis of recurrent case also revealed that the relapsed clone might be derived from a minor clone of the bone marrow at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In this study, through WES for seven patients with TCF3-PBX1-positive B-LBL, we identified KMT2D mutations and 6q LOH as recurrent alterations. In order to elucidate the relationship between these recurrent alterations and disease specificity or outcomes, further studies comparing with TCF3-PBX1-positive B-ALL are required.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data regarding implementation of an HAH unit for caring patients with hematological malignancies in our center, during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Between January and November 2020, 105 patients were treated in the HAH unit for a total of 204 episodes. Nine patients with multiple myeloma (MM) received autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT). Three patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) received consolidation therapy, 32 patients underwent clinical and analytical monitoring, 20 were transplant recipients early discharged (5 auto-HSCT and 15 allo-HSCT) and 2 had received CART cells therapy. Azacitidine, bortezomib and carfilzomib were administered at home to 54 patients with AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or MM. A median of 17 (IQR 13-19) days of admission per patient and a total of 239 visits to the Hematology day-care hospital were avoided. Overall, 28 patients (14% of all episodes) needed admission to the hospital, 4 of them due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a Hematology HAH unit was feasible and safe, and provided thorough advanced care to a high-risk population. Advanced care-at-home strategies can be crucial during times of COVID-19 to minimize treatment interruptions and reduce the risk of cross-infections.",['(c) 2021.

The resulting BET-independent MLV(W390A-CBX) was shown to integrate efficiently and more randomly, away from typical retroviral markers. In this study, we assessed the functionality and stability of expression of the redistributed MLV(W390A-CBX) vector in more depth, and evaluated safety using a clinically more relevant vector design encompassing a self-inactivated (SIN) LTR and a weak internal elongation factor 1alpha short (EFS) promoter. MLV(W390A-CBX)-EFS produced like MLV(WT) and efficiently transduced laboratory cells and primary human CD34(+) hematopoetic stem cells (HSC) without transgene silencing over time, while displaying a more preferred, redistributed, and safer integration pattern. In a human mesoangioblast (MAB) stem cell model, the myogenic fusion capacity was hindered following MLV(WT) transduction, while this remained unaffected when applying MLV(W390A-CBX). Likewise, smooth muscle cell differentiation of MABs was unaltered by MLV(W390A-CBX)-EFS.

Changes in some genetic profiles may contribute to the poor prognosis of AML. Although the prognostic value of G protein subunit alpha 15 (GNA15) in AML has been reported based on the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database, the prognostic significance of GNA15 has not been verified in clinical samples. The biological functions of GNA15 in AML development remain open to investigation. This study explored the clinical significance, biological effects and molecular mechanism of GNA15 in AML. Methods: Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression level of GNA15 in blasts of bone marrow specimens from 154 newly diagnosed adult AML patients and 26 healthy volunteers. AML cell lines, Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1, were used for lentiviral transfection. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and colony formation assays were used to determine cell proliferation. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The relevant signaling pathways were evaluated by Western blot. The Log-Rank test and Kaplan-Meier were used to evaluate survival rate, and the Cox regression model was used to analyze multivariate analysis. Xenograft tumor mouse model was used for in vivo experiments. Results: The expression of GNA15 in adult AML was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals. Subjects with high GNA15 expression showed lower overall survival and relapse-free survival in adult AML with normal karyotype. High GNA15 expression was independently correlated with a worse prognosis in multivariate analysis. Knockdown of GNA15 inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and induced cell apoptosis in AML cells. GNA15-knockdown induced down-regulation of p-P38 MAPK and its downstream p-MAPKAPK2 and p-CREB. Rescue assays confirmed that P38 MAPK signaling pathway was involved in the inhibition of proliferation mediated by GNA15 knockdown. Conclusions: In summary, GNA15 was highly expressed in adult AML, and high GNA15 expression was independently correlated with a worse prognosis in adult AML with normal karyotype. Knockdown of GNA15 inhibited the proliferation of AML regulated by the P38 MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, GNA15 may serve as a potential prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for AML in the future.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Liu, Liu, Yang, Xu, Wang, Jiang, Liu, Wang and Wang.']","['Li, Mengya', 'Liu, Yu', 'Liu, Yajun', 'Yang, Lu', 'Xu, Yan', 'Wang, Weiqiong', 'Jiang, Zhongxing', 'Liu, Yanfang', 'Wang, Shujuan', 'Wang, Chong']","['Li M', 'Liu Y', 'Liu Y', 'Yang L', 'Xu Y', 'Wang W', 'Jiang Z', 'Liu Y', 'Wang S', 'Wang C']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210906,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['GNA15', 'P38 MAPK', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell proliferation', 'prognosis']",2021/09/24 06:00,2021/09/24 06:01,['2021/09/23 06:53'],"['2021/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/23 06:53 [entrez]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.724435 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 6;11:724435. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.724435. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8451478,,,,,,,,,,

The relevance of phosphoproteomic profiling for the early identification of BTKi responders remains underexplored. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A set of six clinical samples from an ongoing phase I trial dosing patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with TG-1701, a novel irreversible and highly specific BTKi, were characterized by phosphoproteomic and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. The activity of TG-1701 was evaluated in a panel of 11 B-NHL cell lines and mouse xenografts, including two NF-kappaB- and BTK(C481S)-driven BTKi-resistant models. Biomarker validation and signal transduction analysis were conducted through real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, immunostaining, and gene knockout (KO) experiments. RESULTS: A nonsupervised, phosphoproteomic-based clustering did match the early clinical outcomes of patients with CLL and separated a group of ""early-responders"" from a group of ""late-responders."" This clustering was based on a selected list of 96 phosphosites with Ikaros-pSer442/445 as a potential biomarker for TG-1701 efficacy. TG-1701 treatment was further shown to blunt Ikaros gene signature, including YES1 and MYC, in early-responder patients as well as in BTKi-sensitive B-NHL cell lines and xenografts. In contrast, Ikaros nuclear activity and signaling remained unaffected by the drug in vitro and in vivo in late-responder patients and in BTK(C481S), BTK(KO), and noncanonical NF-kappaB models. CONCLUSIONS: These data validate phosphoproteomic as a valuable tool for the early detection of response to BTK inhibition in the clinic, and for the determination of drug mechanism of action.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Ribeiro, Marcelo Lima', 'Reyes-Garau, Diana', 'Vinyoles, Meritxell', 'Profitos Peleja, Nuria', 'Santos, Juliana Carvalho', 'Armengol, Marc', 'Fernandez-Serrano, Miranda', 'Sedo Mor, Alicia', 'Bech-Serra, Joan J', 'Blecua, Pedro', 'Musulen, Eva', 'De La Torre, Carolina', 'Miskin, Hari', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Normant, Emmanuel', 'Roue, Gael']","['Ribeiro ML', 'Reyes-Garau D', 'Vinyoles M', 'Profitos Peleja N', 'Santos JC', 'Armengol M', 'Fernandez-Serrano M', 'Sedo Mor A', 'Bech-Serra JJ', 'Blecua P', 'Musulen E', 'De La Torre C', 'Miskin H', 'Esteller M', 'Bosch F', 'Menendez P', 'Normant E', 'Roue G']","['Lymphoma Translational Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Immunopharmacology and Molecular Biology, Sao Francisco University Medical School, Braganca Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Lymphoma Translational Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Stem Cell Biology, Developmental Leukemia and Immunotherapy Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Lymphoma Translational Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Lymphoma Translational Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Lymphoma Translational Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Lymphoma Translational Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Lymphoma Translational Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Proteomics Unit, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitari General de Catalunya-Grupo Quironsalud, Sant Cugat del Valles, Spain.', 'Proteomics Unit, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'TG Therapeutics, New York, New York.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Experimental Hematology, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Stem Cell Biology, Developmental Leukemia and Immunotherapy Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'TG Therapeutics, New York, New York. groue@carrerasresearch.org enormant@tgtxinc.com.', 'Lymphoma Translational Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain. groue@carrerasresearch.org enormant@tgtxinc.com.', 'Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Experimental Hematology, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210922,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,,2021/09/24 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2021/09/23 05:55'],"['2021/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/23 05:55 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-21-1067 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1067 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Dec 1;27(23):6591-6601. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1067.

Finding a helpful marker is vital to determine the correct treatment approach. The present study was aimed to evaluate the expression of the B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) gene in papillary carcinoma, adenoma, and adjacent healthy thyroid tissues. Pathology blocks of thyroid tissues at the pathology department of patients who have undergone thyroid surgery between 2015 and 2019 were examined; papillary carcinoma, adenoma, and healthy tissues were selected and sectioned. Total RNA was extracted, and the relative expression level of the BMI-1 gene was examined using the Real-Time qPCR method. RESULTS: In the papillary and adenoma tissues, BMI-1 was overexpressed (1.047-fold and 1.042-fold) in comparison to healthy tissues (p < 0.05 for both comparisons). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between adenoma and papillary carcinoma tissues regarding BMI-1 gene expression. This study demonstrated a new biomarker for thyroid malignancies and found that the mRNA levels of the BMI-1 gene were higher in tumor tissues compared with healthy tissues.

Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and multicolor flow cytometry (FCM) were used to detect DEK-NUP214 gene expression and leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) in 15 newly diagnosed patients with positive DEK-NUP214 and receiving allo-HSCT from September 2012 to September 2017 at Peking University People's Hospital. The clinical outcome was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The impact of DEK-NUP214 expression was analyzed by log-rank test. Results: The subjects were followed-up with a median period of 657 (62-2 212) days. The median DEK-NUP214 expression level at diagnosis was 488% (274%-1 692%). Thirteen patients achieved complete remission before allo-HSCT. Thirteen patients had a residual DEK-NUP214 expression of 0.38% (0.029%-738.9%) before allo-HSCT. After allo-HSCT, DEK-NUP214 expression in 9/13 patients remained positive, which dropped by around 500 folds (5.7-5 663.0 folds) within a month post-transplant. Five patients died and 2 patients relapsed. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients with positive DEK-NUP214 before transplant was 17.5%+/-11.3% and the 3-year overall survival was 60.5%+/-13.8%.

In cancer, Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) can be inferred from short-read sequencing data, enabling genomics-based precision oncology. Emerging Nanopore sequencing technologies offer the potential for broader clinical utility, for example in smaller hospitals, due to lower instrument cost, higher portability, and ease of use. Nonetheless, Nanopore sequencing devices are limited in the number of retrievable sequencing reads/molecules compared to short-read sequencing platforms, limiting CNA inference accuracy. To address this limitation, we targeted the sequencing of short-length DNA molecules loaded at optimized concentration in an effort to increase sequence read/molecule yield from a single nanopore run. We show that short-molecule nanopore sequencing reproducibly returns high read counts and allows high quality CNA inference. We demonstrate the clinical relevance of this approach by accurately inferring CNAs in acute myeloid leukemia samples. The data shows that, compared to traditional approaches such as chromosome analysis/cytogenetics, short molecule nanopore sequencing returns more sensitive, accurate copy number information in a cost effective and expeditious manner, including for multiplex samples. Our results provide a framework for short-molecule nanopore sequencing with applications in research and medicine, which includes but is not limited to, CNAs.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The common features and coexisting mutations of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with KMT2A-MLLT10 remain unknown. In this study, 10 adult AML patients with KMT2A-MLLT10 fusions were picked up from 496 AML patients by using RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization, and then screened for mutations in the 49 genes panel with next-generation sequencing and PCR, followed by direct Sanger sequencing. Of the 10 unique individuals identified, 6 were male and 4 were female (M:F ratio, 1.5:1) with ages ranging from 19 to 52 years (median 39.5 years). Most (90%, 9/10) patients with KMT2A-MLLT10 were accompanied by additional mutations. Twelve mutated genes were detected, averaging 2.1 mutations per patient (range, 0-4). The most frequently mutated gene was NRAS (n = 5). Clinical and laboratory data pointed to common features: French American British-M5 subtype (n = 7), a high rate of relapse, and biomarkers CD33 (n = 10), CD117 (n = 9), CD13 (n = 8), and CD64 (n = 8). Overall, most patients harbored at least one mutation. A high incidence of mutations affecting the RAS signaling pathway or RAS regulating components was found in 50% (5/10) patients. The overall survival is about 12.0 months. Allogeneic-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation trends to improve survival in selected patients.","['(c) 2021 S.

METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched from inception to March 2021 for studies on maintenance therapies after allo-HCT in AML and MDS. Studies were excluded if they were reviews, commentaries, case series with <5 patients, or basic research articles, not published in English, not on post-allo-HCT maintenance with FLT3 inhibitors or HMA in AML or MDS, or if they were clinical trials without published results or duplicate publications from the same patient cohort. Studies with insufficient reporting of the primary endpoint (2-year overall survival [OS]) and studies using FLT3 inhibitors or HMA for pre-emptive treatment of imminent relapse based on positive measurable residual disease testing were excluded. Random-effects models were used to pool response rates for the primary outcome of 2-year OS. Hazard ratios (HR) for death and relapse were calculated for studies that included a control group. Rates of relapse-free survival (RFS), non-relapse mortality, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) were studied as secondary endpoints. Downs and Black checklist and risk of bias assessments were used to gauge the quality of individual studies. The study protocol has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020187298). RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 5559 studies. Twenty-one studies with a total of 809 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The 2-year OS rates were 81.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.8%-87.7%) and 65.7% (95% CI, 55.1%-74.9%) among patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors and HMA, respectively. In sensitivity analyses restricted to studies that included a control group, maintenance therapy with FLT3 inhibitors (HR for death = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26-0.62) or HMA (HR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31-0.66) appeared superior to no maintenance therapy. The 2-year RFS rates were 79.8% (95% CI, 75.0%-83.9%) and 62.4% (95% CI, 50.6%-72.9%) among patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors and HMA, respectively. Rates of any grade acute and chronic GVHD were 33.1% (95% CI, 25.4%-41.8%; grade 3/4: 16.5%) and 42.5% (95% CI, 26.3%-60.4%) among FLT3 inhibitor and 42.7% (95% CI, 33.5%-52.4%; grade 3/4: 8.1%) and 41.5% (95% CI, 32.0%-51.6%) among HMA-treated patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Maintenance therapy with either FLT3 inhibitors or HMA after allo-HCT can lead to prolonged and improved OS and RFS with a favorable safety profile. Additional studies are needed to define the optimal duration of treatment, the role of measurable residual disease status, and transplant characteristics in patient selection.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Through integrated proteomics and bioinformatics, we find that FOXC1 and RUNX1 interact through Forkhead and Runt domains, respectively, and co-occupy primed and active enhancers distributed close to differentiation genes. FOXC1 stabilizes association of RUNX1, HDAC1, and Groucho repressor TLE3 to limit enhancer activity: FOXC1 knockdown induces loss of repressor proteins, gain of CEBPA binding, enhancer acetylation, and upregulation of nearby genes, including KLF2. Furthermore, it triggers genome-wide redistribution of RUNX1, TLE3, and HDAC1 from enhancers to promoters, leading to repression of self-renewal genes, including MYC and MYB. Our studies highlight RUNX1 and CEBPA transcription factor swapping as a feature of leukemia cell differentiation and reveal that FOXC1 prevents this by stabilizing enhancer binding of a RUNX1/HDAC1/TLE3 transcription repressor complex to oncogenic effect.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

DOT1L is a versatile histone H3K79 methyltransferase with a prominent role in MLL-fusion leukemia, yet little is known about how DOT1L responds to extracellular stimuli. Here, we report that DOT1L protein stability is regulated by the extracellular glucose level through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Mechanistically, DOT1L is O-GlcNAcylated at evolutionarily conserved S1511 in its C terminus. We identify UBE3C as a DOT1L E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting DOT1L degradation whose interaction with DOT1L is susceptible to O-GlcNAcylation. Consequently, HBP enhances H3K79 methylation and expression of critical DOT1L target genes such as HOXA9/MEIS1, promoting cell proliferation in MLL-fusion leukemia. Inhibiting HBP or O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) increases cellular sensitivity to DOT1L inhibitor. Overall, our work uncovers O-GlcNAcylation and UBE3C as critical determinants of DOT1L protein abundance, revealing a mechanism by which glucose metabolism affects malignancy progression through histone methylation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Are the same results observed in the general population? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were identified from the three French hematological malignancies population-based registries. All CML patients (ICD-O-3: 9875/3) diagnosed between 2006 and 2016 and resided in registries areas were included. The TKI generation effect on achievement of MMR in first-line therapy was assessed through a multivariate competitive risk analysis. An alluvial plot described the pathways leading to death. RESULTS: In total, 507 CML patients received TKI in first-line treatment, 22% were enrolled in a clinical trial. After adjustment, NG-TKI patients were significantly more likely to achieve MMR during first-line therapy than IM patients (HR: 1.88 CI95% [1.35-2.61]). At the end of follow-up, 212 patients were still in first-line therapy (46 of them died), 203 switched to second-line (43 subsequently died), 26 were on TFR from first-line (4 subsequently died), and 20 stopped their treatment (16 subsequently died). DISCUSSION: In this comprehensive real-life setting, the results were consistent with clinical trials. The results are not sufficient to conclude that a NG-TKI treatment is superior with regard to these patients, despite indications regarding differences between the TKI generation effect on survival and tolerance.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

An adjusted multivariable analysis compared to intermediate-risk patients detected an increased risk of relapse for KMT2A-rearranged and adverse-risk patients (HR 1.27, p = 0.01 and HR 1.71, p < 0.001, respectively). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was similar for KMT2A and adverse-risk patients (HR 1.26, p = 0.002 and HR 1.47, p < 0.001), as was overall survival (OS) (HR 1.32, p < 0.001 and HR 1.45, p < 0.001).

ZEB1 is a close family member of ZEB2 but has remained more enigmatic concerning its roles in hematopoiesis. Here, we show using conditional loss-of-function approaches and bone marrow (BM) reconstitution experiments that ZEB1 plays a cell-autonomous role in hematopoietic lineage differentiation, particularly as a positive regulator of monocyte development in addition to its previously reported important role in T-cell differentiation. Analysis of existing single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of early hematopoiesis has revealed distinctive expression differences between Zeb1 and Zeb2 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) differentiation, with Zeb2 being more highly and broadly expressed than Zeb1 except at a key transition point (short-term HSC [ST-HSC]MPP1), whereby Zeb1 appears to be the dominantly expressed family member. Inducible genetic inactivation of both Zeb1 and Zeb2 using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated approach leads to acute BM failure at this transition point with increased long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cell numbers and an accompanying decrease in all hematopoietic lineage differentiation. Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data has revealed that ZEB2 acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor involved in restraining mature hematopoietic lineage gene expression programs from being expressed too early in HSPCs. ZEB1 appears to fine-tune this repressive role during hematopoiesis to ensure hematopoietic lineage fidelity. Analysis of Rosa26 locus-based transgenic models has revealed that Zeb1 as well as Zeb2 cDNA-based overexpression within the hematopoietic system can drive extramedullary hematopoiesis/splenomegaly and enhance monocyte development. Finally, inactivation of Zeb2 alone or Zeb1/2 together was found to enhance survival in secondary MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models attesting to the oncogenic role of ZEB1/2 in AML.",,"['Wang, Jueqiong', 'Farkas, Carlos', 'Benyoucef, Aissa', 'Carmichael, Catherine', 'Haigh, Katharina', 'Wong, Nick', 'Huylebroeck, Danny', 'Stemmler, Marc P', 'Brabletz, Simone', 'Brabletz,

More than 91,000 responders were exposed to a range of hazards during the recovery and clean-up operation that followed. Various health programs track the on-going health effects of 9/11, including the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program (WTCHP). The objective of this research was to review WTCHP statistics reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to analyze health trends among enrolled responders as the 20-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks approaches. METHODS: The WTCHP statistics reported by the CDC were analyzed to identify health trends among enrolled responders from 2011 through 2021. Statistics for non-responders were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 80,745 responders were enrolled in the WTCHP as of March 2021: 62,773 were classified as general responders; 17,023 were Fire Department of New York (FDNY) responders; and 989 were Pentagon and Shanksville responders. Of the total responders in the program, 3,439 are now deceased. Just under 40% of responders with certified health issues were aged 45-64 and 83% were male. The top three certified conditions among enrolled responders were: aerodigestive disorders; cancer; and mental ill health. The top ten certified cancers have remained the same over the last five years, however, leukemia has now overtaken colon and bladder cancer as the 20-year anniversary approaches. Compared to the general population, 9/11 first responders had a higher rate of all cancers combined, as well as higher rates of prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and leukemia. DISCUSSION: Trends in these program statistics should be viewed with some caution. While certain illnesses have been linked with exposure to the WTC site, differences in age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and other factors between exposed and unexposed groups should also be considered. Increased rates of some illnesses among this cohort may be associated with heightened surveillance rather than an actual increase in disease. Still, cancer in general, as well as lung disease, heart disease, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), seem to be increasing among 9/11 responders, even now close to 20 years later. CONCLUSION: Responders should continue to avail themselves of the health care and monitoring offered through programs like the WTCHP.",,"['Smith, Erin', 'Holmes, Lisa', 'Larkin, Brigid']","['Smith E', 'Holmes L', 'Larkin B']","['Edith Cowan University, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Joondalup, Perth, Western Australia.', 'Edith Cowan University, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Joondalup, Perth, Western Australia.', 'Edith Cowan University, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Joondalup, Perth, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210902,United States,Prehosp Disaster Med,Prehospital and disaster medicine,8918173,,['NOTNLM'],"['9/11', 'September 11', 'World Trade Center', 'World Trade Center Health Program', 'first responder']",2021/09/23 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2021/09/22 12:16'],"['2021/09/22 12:16 [entrez]', '2021/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1049023X21000881 [pii]', '10.1017/S1049023X21000881 [doi]']",ppublish,Prehosp Disaster Med. 2021 Oct;36(5):621-626. doi: 10.1017/S1049023X21000881.

The unique property of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma; PPARG) in transmitting the anti-survival signals of the chemotherapeutic drugs has fired the enthusiasm into the application of this receptor in cancer treatment. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the expression of PPARgamma and one of its downstream targets PTEN in non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We also investigated the therapeutic value of PPARgamma stimulation using pioglitazone in the AML-derived U937 cell line. METHODS: The blood samples from 30 patients diagnosed with non-M3 AML as well as 10 healthy individuals were collected and the mRNA expression levels of PPARgamma and PTEN were evaluated. Additionally, we used trypan blue assay, MTT assay, and flow cytometry analysis to evaluate the anti-leukemic effects of pioglitazone on U937 cells. RESULTS: While PTEN was significantly downregulated in AML patients as compared to the control group, the expression of PPARgamma was increased in the patients' group. The expression level of PPARgamma was also negatively correlated with PTEN; however, it was not statistically significant. Besides, PPARgamma stimulation using pioglitazone reduced survival and proliferative capacity of U937 cells through inducing apoptosis and suppression of cell transition from the G1 phase of the cell cycle. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study shed more light on the importance of PPARgamma and its stimulation in the therapeutic strategies of AML.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, donor knowledge and response to notification has not been assessed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted among blood donors notified of HTLV-1 seropositivity regarding their knowledge of HTLV-1 and unmet information needs. To reduce anxiety among notified individuals and raise awareness of their infection status, we created a booklet containing information that would be useful for these individuals without causing unnecessary anxiety while also requesting that they refrain from donating blood in the future. RESULTS: A questionnaire survey conducted before the distribution of a new booklet revealed that 15.0% of respondents donated blood again despite receiving an HTLV-1-seropositive notification at the previous donation. While 62.2% of respondents reacted to the notification favourably, 40.2% expressed anxiety and 32.5% requested information on related diseases and medical institutions for consultation. In the secondary survey after distribution of the new booklet, 87.9% of respondents reported that the information was comprehensible, and an increase in consultations of medical institutions by notification recipients was observed. Furthermore, no re-visiting donors were observed among the HTLV-1-seropositive recipients who were notified using the new information booklet. CONCLUSION: The new information booklet provided enlightenment on HTLV-1 infection and facilitated the consultation of medical institutions by seropositive donors, leading to an improvement in the health-related quality of life of seropositive blood donors and the safety of blood products.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We create nanoTCEs using liposomes conjugated to monoclonal antibodies to enable specific binding. We also recreate the bone marrow niche using our 3D culture system and use immunocompromised mice to enable use of human AML and T cells with nanoTCEs. We show that CD33 is ubiquitously present on AML cells. The CD33 nanoTCEs bind preferentially to AML cells compared to Isotype. We show that nanoTCEs effectively activate T cells and induce AML killing in vitro and in vivo.

To identify new drug molecules to treat MRSA patients, we have undertaken to search essential proteins that are indispensable for their survival but non-homologous to human host proteins. The current study utilizes a subtractive genome and proteome approach to screen the possible therapeutic targets against S. aureus USA300. Bacterial essential genes are obtained from the DEG database and are compared to avoid cross-reactivity with human host genes. In silico analysis shows 198 proteins that may be considered as therapeutic candidates. Depending on their sub-cellular localization, proteins are grouped as either vaccine or drug targets or both. Extracellular proteins such as cell division proteins (Q2FZ91, Q2FZ95), penicillin-binding proteins (Q2FZ94, Q2FYI0) of the bacterial cell wall, phosphoglucomutase (Q2FE11) and lipoteichoic acid synthase (Q2FIS2) are considered as vaccine targets, and their epitopes have been mapped. Altogether, 53 drug targets are identified, which have shown similarity with the drug targets available in the DrugBank database. Predicted drug targets belong to the common metabolic pathways of MRSA, such as fatty acid biosynthesis, folate biosynthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, ribosome, etc. Protein-protein interaction analysis emphasizing peptidoglycan biosynthesis reveals the connection between penicillin-binding proteins, mur-family proteins and FemXAB proteins. In this study, staphylococcal FemA protein (P0A0A5) is subjected to structure-based virtual screening for the drug repurposing approach. There are 20 residues missing in the crystal structure of FemA, and 12 of these residues are located at the catalytic site. The missing residues are modelled, and stereochemistry is checked. FDA approved drugs available in the DrugBank database have been used in virtual screening with FemA in search of potential repurposed molecules. This approach provides us with 10 drugs that may be used in the treatment of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal mediated diseases. AutoDock 4.2 is used for in silico screening and shows a comparable inhibition constant (Ki) for all 10 FDA-approved drugs towards FemA. Most of these drugs are used in the treatment of various cancers, migraines and leukaemia. Protein-drug interaction analysis shows that the drugs mostly interact with hydrophobic residues of FemA. Moreover, Tyr328 and Lys383 contribute largely to hydrogen bondings during interactions. All interacting amino acids that bind to the drugs are part of the active site cavity of FemA.

However, data of a large series of children with acute leukaemia(AL) in this setting is missing. We analysed 144 AL Haplo-PTCy paediatric recipients; median age was 10 years. Patients had acute lymphoblastic(ALL; n = 86) or myeloblastic leukaemia(AML; n = 58) and were transplanted in remission(CR1: n = 40; CR2: n = 57; CR3+: n = 27) or relapse (n = 20). Bone marrow was the graft source in 57%; donors were father (54%), mother (35%), or sibling (11%). Myeloablative conditioning was used in 87%. Median follow-up was 31 months. At day +100, cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery and acute GVHD (II-IV) were 94% and 40%, respectively. At 2-years, CI of chronic GVHD and relapse, were 31%, 40%, and estimated 2-year overall survival (OS), leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and graft-versus-host-relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 52%, 44% and 34% respectively. For patients transplanted in remission, positive measurable residual disease (MRD) prior to transplant was associated with decreased LFS (p = 0.05) and GRFS (p = 0.003) and increased risk of relapse (p = 0.02). Mother donor was associated with increased risk of chronic GVHD (p = 0.001), decreased OS (p = 0.03) and GRFS (p = 0.004). Use of PBSC was associated with increased risk of chronic GVHD (p = 0.04). In conclusion, achieving MRD negativity pre-transplant, avoiding use of mother donors and PBSC as graft source may improve outcomes of Haplo-PTCy in children with AL.","['(c) 2021.

To explore the mechanisms underlying the selective sensitivity of mutant leukemia cells to VEN and AZA, we used cell-based isogenic models containing a common leukemia-associated mutation in the epigenetic regulator ASXL1. KBM5 cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the ASXL1(G710X) mutation showed reduced leukemic growth, increased myeloid differentiation, and decreased HOXA and BCL2 gene expression in vitro compared to uncorrected KBM5 cells. Increased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, BCL2, was also observed in bone marrow CD34+ cells from ASXL1 mutant MDS patients compared to CD34+ cells from wild-type MDS cases. ATAC-sequencing demonstrated open chromatin at the BCL2 promoter in the ASXL1 mutant KBM5 cells. BH3 profiling demonstrated increased dependence of mutant cells on BCL2. Upon treatment with VEN, mutant cells demonstrated increased growth inhibition. In addition, genome-wide methylome analysis of primary MDS samples and isogenic cell lines demonstrated increased gene-body methylation in ASXL1 mutant cells, with consequently increased sensitivity to AZA. These data mechanistically link the common leukemia-associated mutation ASXL1 to enhanced sensitivity to VEN and AZA via epigenetic upregulation of BCL2 expression and widespread alterations in DNA methylation.",['(c) 2021.

Methods: The clinical data of 410 patients with Ph(+) CML, including 348 patients with primary CML-CP and 62 patients who progressed to CML-AP/BP during treatment, who were admitted to Henan People's Hospital from January 2013 to June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed to categorize into high-risk, non-high-risk, and non-ACA groups according to the ELN2020 criteria. The effects of high- and non-high-risk ACA on biological characteristics, therapy efficacy, and prognosis were compared. Results: 1 in circleAmong the 348 patients with primary CML-CP, 20 patients (5.75% ) had ACA, including 3 and 17 patients with high-risk and non-high-risk ACA, respectively, whereas the remaining 328 patients did not have ACA. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between those with and without ACA (P>0.05 for all) . The rates of complete hematological response, complete cytogenetic response, major molecular remission, and 5-year overall survival (OS) were not significantly different between the non-high-risk ACA and non-ACA groups (P>0.05 for all) ; however, the 5-year progression-free survival of the non-high-risk ACA group (42.0% ) was significantly lower than that of the non-ACA group (74.5% ) (chi(2)=4.766, P=0.029) .2 in circleOf the 62 patients who progressed to CML-AP/BP during treatment, 41 patients (66.13% ) had ACA, including 28 and 13 patients with high-risk and non-high-risk ACA, respectively, whereas the remaining 21 patients did not have ACA. Platelet counts of the high-risk ACA group (42.5x10(9)/L) were lower than those of the non-high-risk (141x10(9)/L) and non-ACA groups (109x10(9)/L) (chi(2)=4.968, P=0.083) . There was no significant difference in the incidence of point mutations in ABL kinase among the three groups (P=0.652) . The complete cytogenetic response of the high-risk ACA group (5.3% ) was significantly lower than that of the non-ACA group (46.7% ) (chi(2)=5.851, P=0.016) . The 5-year OS of the high-risk ACA group was lower than that of the non-ACA group (46.2% vs 77.8% , chi(2)=3.878, P=0.049) . Subgroup analysis revealed that the 5-year OS rate of the high-risk group , which included -7/7q-, i (17q) , and complex karyotype comprising >/=2 high-risk ACA, was significantly lower than that of the non-ACA group (28.6% vs 77.8% , chi(2)=8.035, P=0.005) whereas the 5-year OS rate was not significantly different between high-risk group , which included +8,+Ph, and complex ACA with +8/+Ph, and the non-ACA group (54.5% vs 77.8% , chi(2) =1.514, P=0.219) . Conclusion: Due to different disease stages and ACA/Ph(+) types, treatment response and prognosis vary among patients with CML harboring ACA/Ph(+). The emergence of high-risk ACA during therapy suggests worse therapy efficacy and prognosis. Strict and standardized cytogenetic monitoring is critical for early detection, precise diagnosis, and treatment of these patients.",,"['Dong, X Y', 'Li, Y L', 'Wu, C Y', 'Shang, B J', 'Zhang, L', 'Cheng, W', 'Zhu, Z M']","['Dong XY', 'Li YL', 'Wu CY', 'Shang BJ', 'Zhang L', 'Cheng W', 'Zhu ZM']","[""Institute of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital; Henan Key Laboratory of Hematopathology; Henan Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Differentiation and Modification, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University; People's Hospital of Henan University, Zhengzhou 450003, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital; Henan Key Laboratory of Hematopathology; Henan Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Differentiation and Modification, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University; People's Hospital of Henan University, Zhengzhou 450003, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital; Henan Key Laboratory of Hematopathology; Henan Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Differentiation and Modification, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University; People's Hospital of Henan University, Zhengzhou 450003, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital; Henan Key Laboratory of Hematopathology; Henan Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Differentiation and Modification, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University; People's Hospital of Henan University, Zhengzhou 450003, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital; Henan Key Laboratory of Hematopathology; Henan Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Differentiation and Modification, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University; People's Hospital of Henan University, Zhengzhou 450003, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital; Henan Key Laboratory of Hematopathology; Henan Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Differentiation and Modification, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University; People's Hospital of Henan University, Zhengzhou 450003, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital; Henan Key Laboratory of Hematopathology; Henan Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Differentiation and Modification, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University; People's Hospital of Henan University, Zhengzhou 450003, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Additional chromosomal abnormalities', 'Leukemia, myelogenous, chronic, BCR-ABL positive', 'Prognosis']",2021/09/23 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2021/09/22 03:54'],"['2021/09/22 03:54 [entrez]', '2021/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.08.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Aug 14;42(8):660-665. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.08.008.,20210923,,"['Blast Crisis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",8,,,['SB20191094/Medical Science and Technology Research Project of Henan Province'],PMC8501281,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The study, which was conducted from July 2011 to August 2017 in First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, comprised 195 newly diagnosed patients with CBF-AML, including 190 patients who achieved first complete remission after induction chemotherapy. The cohort included 134 patients with RUNX1-RUNXIT1(+) AML and 56 patients with CBFbeta-MYH11(+) AML. The cohort age ranged from 15 to 64 years, with a median follow-up of 43.6 months. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed by the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the effects of clinical factors and genetic mutations on prognosis. Results: The most common genetic mutations were in KIT (47.6% ) , followed by NRAS (20.0% ) , FLT3 (18.4% ) , ASXL2 (14.3% ) , KRAS (10.7% ) , and ASXL1 (9.7% ) . The most common mutations involved genes affecting tyrosine kinase signaling (76.4% ) , followed by chromatin modifiers (29.7% ) . Among the patients receiving intensive consolidation therapy, the OS tended to be better in patients with CBFbeta-MYH11(+) AML than in those with RUNX1-RUNXIT1 (+) AML (P=0.062) . Gene mutations related to chromatin modification, which were detected only in patients with RUNX1-RUNXIT1(+) AML, did not affect DFS (P=0.557) . The patients with mutations in genes regulating chromatin conformation who received allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) achieved the best prognosis. Multivariate analysis identified KIT exon 17 mutations as an independent predictor of inferior DFS in patients with RUNX1-RUNXIT1(+) AML (P<0.001) , and allo-HSCT significantly prolonged DFS in these patients (P=0.010) . Conclusions: KIT exon 17 mutations might indicate poor prognosis in patients with RUNX1-RUNXIT1(+) AML.

We performed a retrospective, multivariable analysis comparing outcomes of HCT approaches by donor for adults with ALL in remission. The primary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) among haploidentical HCTs using PTCy and HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD), 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD), 7 /8 HLA-MUD, or umbilical cord blood (UCB) HCT. Comparing haploidentical HCT to MSD HCT, we found that OS, leukemia-free survival (LFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) were not different but chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was higher in MSD HCT. Compared with MUD HCT, OS, LFS, and relapse were not different, but MUD HCT had increased NRM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; P = .02), grade 3 to 4 aGVHD (HR, 1.59; P = .005), and cGVHD. Compared with 7/8 UD HCT, LFS and relapse were not different, but 7/8 UD HCT had worse OS (HR, 1.38; P = .01) and increased NRM (HR, 2.13; P </= .001), grade 3 to 4 aGVHD (HR, 1.86; P = .003), and cGVHD (HR, 1.72; P </= .001). Compared with UCB HCT, late OS, late LFS, relapse, and cGVHD were not different but UCB HCT had worse early OS (</=18 months; HR, 1.93; P < .001), worse early LFS (HR, 1.40; P = .007) and increased incidences of NRM (HR, 2.08; P < .001) and grade 3 to 4 aGVHD (HR, 1.97; P < .001). Haploidentical HCT using PTCy showed no difference in survival but less GVHD compared with traditional MSD and MUD HCT and is the preferred alternative donor HCT option for adults with ALL in complete remission.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

Umbralisib is a dual inhibitor of PI3Kdelta and casein kinase-1epsilon (CK1epsilon). This study analyzed integrated comprehensive toxicity data from 4 open-label, phase 1 and 2 studies that included 371 adult patients (median age, 67 years) with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (follicular lymphoma [n = 147]; marginal zone lymphoma [n = 82]; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma/mantle cell lymphoma [n = 74]; chronic lymphocytic leukemia [n = 43]; and other tumor types [n = 25]) who were treated with the recommended phase 2 dose of umbralisib 800 mg or higher once daily. At data cutoff, median duration of umbralisib treatment was 5.9 months (range, 0.1-75.1 months), and 107 patients (28.8%) received umbralisib for >/=12 months. Any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurred in 366 (98.7%) of 371 patients, with the most frequent being diarrhea (52.3%), nausea (41.5%), and fatigue (31.8%). Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent AEs occurred in 189 (50.9%) of 371 patients and included neutropenia (11.3%), diarrhea (7.3%), and increased aminotransferase levels (5.7%). Treatment-emergent serious AEs occurred in 95 (25.6%) of 371 patients. AEs of special interest were limited and included pneumonia (29 of 371 [7.8%]), noninfectious colitis (9 of 371 [2.4%]), and pneumonitis (4 of 371 [1.1%]). AEs led to discontinuation of umbralisib in 51 patients (13.7%). Four patients (1.1%) died of AEs, none of which was deemed related to umbralisib. No cumulative toxicities were reported. The favorable long-term tolerability profile and low rates of immune-mediated toxicities support the potential use of umbralisib for the benefit of a broad population of patients with lymphoid malignancies.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

By using whole transcriptome RNA sequencing in 377 children with B-ALL from the Malaysia-Singapore ALL 2003 (MS2003) and Malaysia-Singapore ALL 2010 (MS2010) studies, we found that, after hyperdiploid and ETV6-RUNX1, the third and fourth most common subtypes were DUX4 (n = 51; 14%) and PAX5alt (n = 36; 10%). DUX4 also formed the largest genetic subtype among patients with poor day-33 minimal residual disease (MRD; n = 12 of 44). But despite the poor MRD, outcome of DUX4 B-ALL was excellent (5-year cumulative risk of relapse [CIR], 8.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8%-19.5% and 5-year overall survival, 97.8%; 95% CI, 85.3%-99.7%). In MS2003, 21% of patients with DUX4 B-ALL had poor peripheral blood response to prednisolone at day 8, higher than other subtypes (8%; P = .03). In MS2010, with vincristine at day 1, no day-8 poor peripheral blood response was observed in the DUX4 subtype (P = .03). The PAX5alt group had an intermediate risk of relapse (5-year CIR, 18.1%) but when IKZF1 was not deleted, outcome was excellent with no relapse among 23 patients. Compared with MS2003, outcome of PAX5alt B-ALL with IKZF1 codeletion was improved by treatment intensification in MS2010 (5-year CIR, 80.0% vs 0%; P = .05). In conclusion, despite its poor initial response, DUX4 B-ALL had a favorable overall outcome, and the prognosis of PAX5alt was strongly dependent on IKZF1 codeletion.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Due to the immunosuppressive nature of the disease, these patients are frequently affected by opportunistic infections and rare pathogens. Furthermore, cytotoxic chemotherapy might lead to poor or even fatal outcomes in the setting of an active infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 62-year-old HCL patient who presented with recurrent fever episodes, pancytopenia, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A treatment decision against purine analogs and for rituximab mono was made as lymph node tissue revealed disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii infection. Together with specific antimycobacterial treatment, rituximab mono led to complete hematologic remission after 6 months without aggravating the accompanying infection. CONCLUSION: Here, we demonstrate successful treatment of HCL with rituximab in a patient with concomitant disseminated M. kansasii infection.","['(c) 2021 S.

The overexpression of PI3Ks leads to hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is considered a pivotal pathway in the occurrence and development of tumors. Hence, PI3Ks are viewed as promising therapeutic targets for anti-cancer therapy. To date, some PI3K inhibitors have achieved desired therapeutic effect via inhibiting the activity of PI3Ks or reducing the level of PI3Ks in clinical trials, among which, Idelalisib, Alpelisib and Duvelisib have been approved by the FDA for treatment of ER(+)/HER2(-) advanced metastatic breast cancer and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL). This review focuses on the latest advances of PI3K inhibitors with efficacious anticancer activity, which are classified into Pan-PI3K inhibitors, isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors based on the isoform affinity. Their corresponding structure characteristics and structures-activity relationship (SAR), together with the progress in the clinical application are mainly discussed.

Uterine gland dysfunction is considered a major contributing factor to pregnancy loss, however our understanding of how glands impact embryo survival and stromal cell decidualization is incomplete. Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) is expressed only in the glandular epithelium and regulates its development and function. Mice with a conditional deletion of FOXA2 in the uterus are infertile due to defective embryo implantation arising from a lack of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a critical factor of uterine gland origin. Here, a glandless FOXA2-deficient mouse model, coupled with LIF repletion to rescue the implantation defect, was used to investigate the roles of uterine glands in embryo survival and decidualization. Studies found that embryo survival and decidualization were compromised in glandless FOXA2-deficient mice on gestational day 6.5, resulting in abrupt pregnancy loss by day 7.5. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that uterine glands secrete factors other than LIF that impact embryo survival and stromal cell decidualization for pregnancy success.",['(c) 2021 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],"['Dhakal, Pramod', 'Fitzgerald, Harriet C', 'Kelleher, Andrew M', 'Liu, Hongyu', 'Spencer, Thomas E']","['Dhakal P', 'Fitzgerald HC', 'Kelleher AM', 'Liu H', 'Spencer TE']","['Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', ""Division of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA."", 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', ""Division of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*FOXA2', '*decidualization', '*endometrium', '*gland', '*pregnancy']",2021/09/22 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/09/21 17:27'],"['2021/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/21 17:27 [entrez]', '2021/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1096/fj.202101170RR [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2021 Oct;35(10):e21938. doi: 10.1096/fj.202101170RR.,20211027,"['0 (Foxa2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '135845-92-0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta)']","['Animals', 'Decidua/immunology/*metabolism', '*Embryo Loss/immunology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*embryology/immunology', '*Embryonic Development/immunology', 'Female', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta/deficiency', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Stromal Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Uterus/immunology/*metabolism']",10,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2815-766X'],['R01 HD096266/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The role of viruses in cancer is typically to initiate cellular transformation through cellular DNA damage, although specific mechanisms remain unknown. Silent and long-term viral infections need to be present, in order to initiate cancer disease. In efforts to establish a causative role of viruses, first is needed to demonstrate the strength and consistency of associations in different populations. The aim of this study was to determine the association of bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a causative agent of leukemia in cattle, with breast cancer and its biomarkers used as prognosis of the severity of the disease (Ki67, HER2, hormonal receptors) in Colombian women. An unmatched, observational case-control study was conducted among women undergoing breast surgery between 2016-2018. Malignant samples (n = 75) were considered as cases and benign samples (n = 83) as controls. Nested-liquid PCR, in-situ PCR and immunohistochemistry were used for viral detection in blood and breast tissues. For the risk assessment, only BLV positive samples from breast tissues were included in the analysis. BLV was higher in cases group (61.3%) compared with controls (48.2%), with a statistically significant association between the virus and breast cancer in the unconditional logistic regression (adjusted-OR = 2.450,95%CI:1.088-5.517, p = 0.031).

U2AF1 mutations that code for the most common amino acid substitutions are always heterozygous, and the retained WT allele is expressed, suggesting that mutant hematopoietic cells may require the residual WT allele to be viable. We show that hematopoiesis and RNA splicing in U2af1 heterozygous knockout mice were similar to those in control mice, but that deletion of the WT allele in U2AF1(S34F) heterozygous mutant-expressing hematopoietic cells (i.e., hemizygous mutant) was lethal. These results confirm that U2AF1 mutant hematopoietic cells are dependent on the expression of WT U2AF1 for survival in vivo and that U2AF1 is a haplo-essential cancer gene. Mutant U2AF1(S34F)-expressing cells were also more sensitive to reduced expression of WT U2AF1 than nonmutant cells. Furthermore, mice transplanted with leukemia cells expressing mutant U2AF1 had significantly reduced tumor burden and improved survival after the WT U2af1 allele was deleted compared with when it was not deleted. These results suggest that selectively targeting the WT U2AF1 allele in heterozygous mutant cells could induce cancer cell death and be a therapeutic strategy for patients harboring U2AF1 mutations.",,"['Wadugu, Brian A', 'Nonavinkere Srivatsan, Sridhar', 'Heard, Amanda', 'Alberti, Michael O', 'Ndonwi, Matthew', 'Liu, Jie', 'Grieb, Sarah', 'Bradley, Joseph', 'Shao, Jin', 'Ahmed, Tanzir', 'Shirai, Cara L', 'Khanna, Ajay', 'Fei, Dennis L', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'Walter, Matthew J']","['Wadugu BA', 'Nonavinkere Srivatsan S', 'Heard A', 'Alberti MO', 'Ndonwi M', 'Liu J', 'Grieb S', 'Bradley J', 'Shao J', 'Ahmed T', 'Shirai CL', 'Khanna A', 'Fei DL', 'Miller CA', 'Graubert TA', 'Walter MJ']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine, Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Section, Cancer Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology', '*RNA processing']",2021/09/22 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/09/21 17:20'],"['2020/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/21 17:20 [entrez]']","['141401 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI141401 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Nov 1;131(21). pii: 141401. doi: 10.1172/JCI141401.,20211207,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (Zrsr1 protein, mouse)']","['*Alleles', 'Animals', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', '*Heterozygote', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism', '*Splicing Factor U2AF/biosynthesis/genetics']",21,,,"['R50 CA211782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA167540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8553566,,,['2022/02/01 00:00'],,,,,,,

Although ATRA can induce differentiation in some non-APL AML cell lines and primary blasts, clinical results of adding ATRA to standard therapy in non-APL AML patients have been inconsistent, probably due to use of different regimens and lack of diagnostic tools for identifying which patients may be sensitive to ATRA. In this study, we exposed primary blasts obtained from non-APL AML patients to ATRA to test for differentiation potential in vitro. We observed increased expression of differentiation markers, indicating a response to ATRA, in four out of fifteen primary AML samples. Three samples in which CD11b increased in response to ATRA had an inversion of chromosome 16 as well as the CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene, and the fourth sample was from a patient with KMT2A-rearranged, therapy-related AML. In conclusion, we identified a subgroup of non-APL AML patients with inv(16) and CBFB-MYH11 as the most sensitive to ATRA-mediated differentiation in vitro, and our results can help identify patients who may benefit from ATRA treatment.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: This retrospective review of 196 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation episodes (144 allogeneic, 52 autologous) performed in a tertiary pediatric unit focused on neurological symptoms and complications occurred from the start of conditioning to within 3 years of transplantation. Indications for transplantation included both benign and malignant diseases. For episodes involving allogeneic transplantation, 42% of donors were matched-unrelated, 19% were matched-sibling, and 12% were haploidentical. RESULTS: Neurological complications developed in 17% of all hematopoietic stem cell transplantation episodes. Tumors of central nervous system and leukemia or lymphoma were two indications reported to have higher incidence of 42% and 21%, respectively. The occurrence of neurological complications was significantly associated with primary diagnosis (p = 0.01), central nervous system involvement by underlying disease (p = 0.001), and radiation-based conditioning (p = 0.018). Upon multivariate analysis, central nervous system involvement by underlying disease remained to be the only significant factor (p = 0.019), while radiation-based containing conditioning (p = 0.029) is revealed to be associated when considering allogeneic transplantation alone. Pre-transplant central nervous system-directed treatment, allogeneic versus autologous donor, stem cell source, donor type, busulfan use, and cyclosporin use were not significantly associated with neurological complications. Patients with neurological complications were also found to have an inferior 2-year overall survival (53.9% +/- 8.8% versus 63.8% +/- 4.2%; p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Neurological complications were common in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and were associated with adverse outcome; non-radiation containing conditioning regimens might be beneficial in mitigating the risk of such complications.","['(c) 2021.

METHODS: APL is confirmed by identifying translocation t(15;17)(q24;q21) PML-RARA by using either molecular or cytogenetic methods on peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens. We used the EPIDEM model to decrease the turnaround time (TAT) of molecular diagnosis by improving communication and developing reflex testing. We additionally compared 32 APL cases against a control group of 18 suspected APL cases. RESULTS: Our review of 687 multiplex polymerase chain reaction orders and 33 PML-RARA orders (January 2012 to April 2021) showed an initial TAT decrease from 4.48 days to 2.71 days (P < .0001), which further decreased to 0.64 days (P < .0001) after implementation of the PML-RARA qualitative assay. Compared with patients suspected of having APL, patients with confirmed APL had higher dimerized plasmin fragment D (P = .0145), lower fibrinogen (P </= .0001), and lower WBC (P </= .0001). CONCLUSIONS: By using the EPIDEM model, with its emphasis on local context, culture, and resources, improved communication and workflow changes enabled us to reduce the time needed to diagnose APL to 0.64 days and identify potential locally derived screening cutoffs.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

We reviewed the epidemiological studies that were initiated in response to these concerns that assessed cancer risks from CT scans using medical record linkage. We evaluated the study methodology and findings and provide recommendations for optimal study design for new efforts. We identified 17 eligible studies; 13 with published risk estimates, and 4 in progress. There was wide variability in the study methodology, however, which made comparison of findings challenging. Key differences included whether the study focused on childhood or adulthood exposure, radiosensitive outcomes (e.g. leukemia, brain tumors) or all cancers, the exposure metrics (e.g. organ doses, effective dose or number of CTs) and control for biases (e.g. latency and exclusion periods and confounding by indication). We were able to compare results for the subset of studies that evaluated leukemia or brain tumors. There were eight studies of leukemia risk in relation to red bone marrow (RBM) dose, effective dose or number of CTs; seven reported a positive dose-response, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in four studies. Six of the seven studies of brain tumors also found a positive dose-response and in five, this was statistically significant. Mean RBM dose ranged from 6 to 12 mGy and mean brain dose from 18 to 43 mGy. In a meta-analysis of the studies of childhood exposure the summary ERR/100 mGy was 1.78 (95%CI: 0.01-3.53) for leukemia/myelodisplastic syndrome (n = 5 studies) and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.48-1.12) for brain tumors (n = 4 studies) (p-heterogeneity >0.4). Confounding by cancer pre-disposing conditions was unlikely in these five studies of leukemia. The summary risk estimate for brain tumors could be over estimated, however, due to reverse causation. In conclusion, there is growing evidence from epidemiological data that CT scans can cause cancer. The absolute risks to individual patients are, however, likely to be small. Ongoing large multicenter cohorts and future pooling efforts will provide more precise risk quantification.",,"['Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy', 'Pasqual, Elisa', 'Veiga, Lene']","['Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'Pasqual E', 'Veiga L']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,IM,,,2021/09/22 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/09/21 08:38'],"['2021/09/21 08:38 [entrez]', '2021/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1259/bjr.20210471 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 2021 Oct 1;94(1126):20210471. doi: 10.1259/bjr.20210471.,20210927,,"['Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Organs at Risk', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Assessment', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1126,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7332-8387'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has enabled in-depth analysis of intercellular heterogeneity in various diseases. However, its full potentials for personalized medicine are yet to be reached. Towards this, we propose A Single-cell Guided pipeline to Aid Repurposing of Drugs (ASGARD). ASGARD can repurpose single drugs for each cell cluster and for multiple cell clusters at individual patient levels; it can also predict personalized drug combinations to address the intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. We tested ASGARD on three independent datasets, including advanced metastatic breast cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On single-drug therapy, ASGARD shows significantly better average accuracy (AUC=0.95) compared to two other single-cell pipelines (AUC 0.69 and 0.57) and two other bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods (AUC 0.80 and 0.75). The top-ranked drugs, such as fulvestrant and neratinib for breast cancer, tretinoin and vorinostat for leukemia, and chloroquine and enalapril for severe COVID19, are either approved by FDA or in clinical trials treating corresponding diseases. In conclusion, ASGARD is a promising pipeline guided by single-cell RNA-seq data, for repurposing personalized drugs and drug combinations.

However, no additional diagnostic criteria for BMM have been proposed. Within the registry dataset of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis, we compared characteristics and outcomes of 390 patients with BMM and 1175 patients with typical ISM. BMM patients were significantly older, predominantly male, had lower tryptase and lower burden of neoplastic mast cells, and displayed a higher frequency of allergic reactions, mainly triggered by Hymenoptera, than patients with typical ISM. The estimated 10-year progression-free survival of BMM and typical ISM was 95.9% and 92.6%, respectively. In BMM patients defined by WHO-based criteria, the presence of one B-Finding and tryptase level >/=125 ng/mL were identified as risk factors for progression in multivariate analyses. BMM patients without any of these risk factors were found to have better progression-free survival (p < 0.05) and better overall survival (p < 0.05) than other ISM patients. These data support the proposal to define BMM as a separate SM variant characterized by SM criteria, absence of skin lesions, absence of B-Findings, and tryptase levels <125 ng/mL.","['(c) 2021.

Clinically, the disease manifests with weight loss, cough, weakness, diarrhea, and multi-organ dysfunction that is unresponsive to therapy. We developed a one-time gene therapy for CEL-NOS using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing an anti-eosinophil monoclonal antibody (AAVrh.10mAnti-Eos) to provide sustained suppression of eosinophil numbers in blood, thus reducing eosinophil tissue invasion and organ dysfunction. A novel CEL-NOS model was developed in NOD-scid IL2rgamma(null) (NSG) mice by administration of AAV expressing the cytokine IL5 (AAVrh.10mIL5), resulting in marked peripheral and tissue eosinophilia of the heart, lung, liver, and spleen, and eventually death. Mice were administered AAVrh.10mAnti-Eos (10(11) genome copies) 4 wk after administration of AAVrh.10mIL5 and evaluated for anti-eosinophil antibody expression, blood eosinophil counts, organ eosinophil invasion, and survival. AAVrh.10mAnti-Eos expressed persistent levels of the anti-eosinophil antibody for >24 wk. Strikingly, CEL-NOS treated mice had markedly lower blood eosinophil levels and reduced mortality when compared with control treated mice. These results suggest that a single treatment with AAVrh.10mAnti-Eos has the potential to provide substantial therapeutic benefit to patients with CEL-NOS, a fatal malignant disorder.","['(c) 2021.

Radiation-induced gliomas (RIGs) have been reported in patients after treatment with cranial irradiation for various primary malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and medulloblastoma (MB). We perform comprehensive (epi-) genetic and expression profiling of RIGs arising after cranial irradiation for MB (n = 23) and ALL (n = 9). Our study reveals a unifying molecular signature for the majority of RIGs, with recurrent PDGFRA amplification and loss of CDKN2A/B and an absence of somatic hotspot mutations in genes encoding histone 3 variants or IDH1/2, uncovering diagnostic markers and potentially actionable targets.",['(c) 2021.

DESIGN: Survey of paediatric oncologists/haematologists. Questionnaires were sent electronically with reminder notifications to non-responders. SETTING: UK Paediatric Oncology Principal Treatment Centres (PTCs). PARTICIPANTS: Paediatric oncologists/haematologists with an interest in the effects of treatment on fertility representing the 20 PTCs across the UK. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Referral practices, sources and length of funding for storage of gametes or gonadal tissue for children diagnosed with cancer in the preceding 12 months. RESULTS: Responses were received from 18 PTCs (90%) with responses to 98.3% of questions. All centres had referred patients for fertility preservation: ovarian tissue collection/storage 100% (n=18 centres), sperm banking 100% (n=17; one centre was excluded due to the age range of their patients), testicular tissue storage 83% (n=15), mature oocyte collection 35% (n=6; one centre was excluded due to the age range of their patients). All centres with knowledge of their funding source reported sperm cryopreservation was NHS funded. Only 60% (n=9) centres reported the same for mature oocyte storage. Of the centres aware of their funding source, half reported that ovarian and testicular tissue storage was funded by charitable sources; this increased in England compared with the rest of the UK. CONCLUSIONS: Inequality exists in provision of fertility preservation for children with cancer across the UK. There is lack of formalised government funding to support international guidelines, with resultant geographical variation in care. Centralised funding of fertility preservation for children and young adults is needed alongside establishment of a national advisory panel to support all PTCs.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

The 2020 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data demonstrates the incidence rate of MDS increases with age especially in those greater than 70 years of age. Risk stratification that impact prognosis, survival, and rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation in MDS is largely dependent on revised International Prognostic Scoring System along with molecular genetic testing as a supplement. Low risk MDS typically have a more indolent disease course in which treatment is only initiated to ameliorate symptoms of cytopenias. In many, anemia is the most common cytopenia requiring treatment and erythroid stimulating agents, are considered first line. In contrast, high risk MDS tend to behave more aggressively for which treatment should be initiated rapidly with Hypomethylating Agents (HMA) being in the frontline. In those with high risk MDS and eligible, evaluation for allogeneic stem cell transplant should be considered as this is the only potential curative option for MDS. With the use of molecular genetic testing, a personalized approach to therapy in MDS has ensued.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous hematological cancer characterized by cytopenias and risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. MDS pathogenesis has been associated with problems of DNA repair system. This report aimed to evaluate NER polymorphisms (XPA rs1800975, XPC rs2228000, XPD rs1799793 and XPF rs1800067) in 269 MDS patients of different populations in Latin America (173 Brazilian and 96 Argentinean). Genotypes were identified in DNA samples by RT-qPCR using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Regarding rs1799793 polymorphism of XPD for Brazilian population, the heterozygous genotype AG presented a high odds ratio (OR) to have a normal karyotype (p = 0.012, OR=3.000) and the mutant homozygous genotype AA was associated to a high OR of AML transformation (p = 0.034, OR=7.4). In Argentine population, the homozygous mutant AA genotype of rs1800975 polymorphism of XPA was associated with an increased odd to have hemoglobin levels below 8g/dL (p = 0.013, OR=10.000) while for the rs1799793 polymorphism of XPD, the heterozygous AG genotype decreased OR to be classified as good (p < 0.001, OR=9.05 x 10(-10)), and intermediate (p < 0.001, OR=3.08 x 10(-10)), according to Revised-International Prognostic Scoring System. Regarding the rs1800067 polymorphisms of XPF, the homozygous mutant AA genotype showed a decreased OR to be classified as good (p < 0.001, OR=4.03 x 10(-13)) and intermediate (p < 0.001, OR=2.54 x 10(-13)).

Expression of the p210 variant is most common in CML (95% of cases), while the p190 and p230 variants are less common (1-4%). On the contrary, p190 predominates in ALL. Measurement of BCR/ABL gene expression is included in clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of CML and ALL as sequential tests in accordance with their occurrence. At the same time, in the context of primary patients testing with suspected hematological malignancies with a low prevalence of BCR-ABL positive patients in the cohort of examined individuals, sequential testing is associated with low cost-effectiveness. Purpose: approbation of a parallel algorithm for detecting all three (p210, p190 and p230) using the multiplex RT-PCR format implemented in the <<BCR/ABL-MULTITEST>> reagent kit. We used anonymized blood samples from patients with suspected CML, as well as samples from ALL patients before starting therapy. Testing of blood samples was carried out using two variants of the algorithm: sequential determination of individual BCR-ABL transcripts and parallel determination using the developed set of reagents <<BCR/ABL-MULTITEST>>. To detect the p210 transcript, a commercial kit <<AmpliSens(R) Leukemia Quantum M-bcr-FRT>> (Central Research Institute of Epidemiology of Rospotrebnadzor, Russia) was used. Simultaneously, a test was used to detect all three variants of BCR-ABL transcripts using the <<BCR/ABL - MULTITEST>> reagent kit based on a monochrome multiplex reaction <<in one test tube>>. Reverse transcription were carried out using the REVERTA-L reagent kit (Central Research Institute of Epidemiology of Rospotrebnadzor, Russia) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Using the reagent kits <<BCR/ABL-MULTITEST>> and <<AmpliSens(R) Leukemia Quantum M-bcr-FRT>> there is a high level of correlation of quantitative results of determining the chimeric transcript BCR-ABL small er, Cyrillic210 (r = 0.99). When using the proposed parallel algorithm with the primary use of the <<BCR/ABL-MULTITEST>> reagent kit, out of 95 patients with suspected CML, 9 samples with p210 transcript were identified, one with p190 BCR / ABL, and in one case a transcript variant characteristic of chronic neutrophilic leukemia - p230 BCR / ABL. The estimated cost for detecting one positive case of BCR-ABL when using the parallel diagnostic algorithm <<BCR/ABL-MULTITEST>> with a focused flow of studies is reduced by about 2 times due to a decrease in the amount of laboratory plastic used and the volume of the reaction mixture, as well as the absence of the need for repeated separate tests to detect p190 and p230. The use of the multiplex PCR-RT test system <<BCR/ABL-MULTITEST>> allows detecting in one test tube all three main variants of BCR-ABL transcripts - p210, p190, p230 and achieving significant resource savings when examining a cohort of patients with suspected CML and ALL and low frequency of positive samples.",,"['Gorbenko, A S', 'Stolyar, M A', 'Vasiliev, E V', 'Mikhalev, M A', 'Bakhtina, V I', 'Olkhovik, T I', 'Mochalova, E E', 'Orlova, K E', 'Olkhovskiy, I A']","['Gorbenko AS', 'Stolyar MA', 'Vasiliev EV', 'Mikhalev MA', 'Bakhtina VI', 'Olkhovik TI', 'Mochalova EE', 'Orlova KE', 'Olkhovskiy IA']","['Krasnoyarsk branch of the <<National Research Center for Hematology>> Department of Health.', 'Federal Research Center Krasnoyarsk Scientific Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.', 'Krasnoyarsk branch of the <<National Research Center for Hematology>> Department of Health.', 'Federal Research Center Krasnoyarsk Scientific Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.', 'Krasnoyarsk regional clinic Hospital.', 'Krasnoyarsk city clinical Hospital numero sign7.', 'Krasnoyarsk regional clinic Hospital.', 'Prof. V.F.

Differences in signaling and drug sensitivity of such subclones complicates treatment and warrants tools to identify them and track disease progression. We previously identified over 50 AML-specific plasma membrane (PM) proteins and seven of these (CD82, CD97, FLT3, IL1RAP, TIM3, CD25 and CD123) were implemented in routine diagnostics in patients with AML (n=256) and MDS (n=33). We developed a pipeline termed CombiFlow in which expression data of multiple PM markers is merged, allowing a Principle Component-based analyses to identify distinctive marker expression profiles and to generate single cell tSNE landscapes to longitudinally track clonal evolution. Positivity for one or more of the markers after 2 courses of intensive chemotherapy predicted a shorter relapse-free survival supporting a role of these markers in measurable residual disease (MRD) detection. CombiFlow also allowed the tracking of clonal evolution in paired diagnosis and relapse samples (n=12). Extending the panel to 36 AML-specific markers further refined the CombiFlow pipeline. In conclusion, CombiFlow provides a valuable tool in the diagnosis, MRD detection, clonal tracking, and the understanding of clonal heterogeneity in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Houtsma, Roos', 'van der Meer, Nisha K', 'Meijer, Kees', 'Morsink, Linde', 'Hogeling, Shanna M', 'Woolthuis, Carolien', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Nijk, Marije', 'de Boer, Bauke', 'Huls, Gerwin', 'Mulder, Andre B', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Houtsma R', 'van der Meer NK', 'Meijer K', 'Morsink L', 'Hogeling SM', 'Woolthuis C', 'Ammatuna E', 'Nijk M', 'de Boer B', 'Huls G', 'Mulder AB', 'Schuringa JJ']","['University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, UMCG, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, UMCG, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Biotech Research Innovation Centre (BRIC), Copenhagen N, Denmark.', 'University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210920,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2021/09/20 17:27'],"['2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/20 17:27 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00592-9 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005018 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2021 Sep 20. pii: S2473-9529(21)00592-9. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005018.,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9583-4424', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4876-2795', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5408-5298', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2124-5333', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6631-645X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8247-4901']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed the first enhancer mapping of pAML in 22 patient samples. Generally, pAML samples were distinct from adult AML samples, and MLL (KMT2A)-rearranged samples were also distinct from non-KMT2A-rearranged samples. Focusing specifically on superenhancers (SEs), we identified SEs associated with many known leukemia regulators. The retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene was differentially regulated in our cohort, and a RARA-associated SE was detected in 64% of the study cohort across all cytogenetic and molecular subtypes tested. RARA SE+ pAML cell lines and samples exhibited high RARA messenger RNA levels. These samples were specifically sensitive to the synthetic RARA agonist tamibarotene in vitro, with slowed proliferation, apoptosis induction, differentiation, and upregulated retinoid target gene expression, compared with RARA SE- samples. Tamibarotene prolonged survival and suppressed the leukemia burden of an RARA SE+ pAML patient-derived xenograft mouse model compared with a RARA SE- patient-derived xenograft. Our work shows that examining chromatin regulation can identify new, druggable dependencies in pAML and provides a rationale for a pediatric tamibarotene trial in children with RARA-high AML.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

A phase 1/2 study (NCT02306291) evaluated the safety, tolerability, and anti-leukemic activity of uproleselan (5-20 mg/kg) with MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine) among patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Among the first 19 patients, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was 10 mg/kg twice daily. An additional 47 patients with R/R AML were treated with uproleselan at the RP2D plus MEC. At the RP2D, the remission rate (complete response [CR]/complete response with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) was 41% (CR 35%) and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.8 months. In a separate cohort, 25 newly diagnosed patients aged >/=60 years received uproleselan at the RP2D plus cytarabine and idarubicin (7+3). In these front-line patients, the CR/CRi rate was 72% (CR 52%) and the median OS was 12.6 months. The addition of uproleselan was associated with low rates of oral mucositis. Eselectin ligand expression on leukemic blasts was higher in patients with relapsed vs primary refractory AML, and with high-risk cytogenetics and secondary AML in newly diagnosed older patients. In the R/R cohort, Eselectin expression above 10% was associated with a higher response rate and improved survival.

We showed that Tax and HBZ target distinct but also common transcription factors. Unexpectedly, we also uncovered a large set of interactions with RNA-binding proteins, including the U2 auxiliary factor large subunit (U2AF2), a key cellular regulator of pre-mRNA splicing. We discovered that Tax and HBZ perturb the splicing landscape by altering cassette exons in opposing manners, with Tax inducing exon inclusion while HBZ induces exon exclusion. Among Tax- and HBZ-dependent splicing changes, we identify events that are also altered in Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) samples from two independent patient cohorts, and in well-known cancer census genes.

However, the effector cells, affected organ(s), and cytokines in the GVHD remain controversially discussed, without having determined a particular cytotoxic activity of the graft against the host. After i.v. injection of C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) spleen cells into irradiated BDF1 (H-2(b/d)) mice, the hosts developed interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-dependent bone marrow (BM) GVHD on days 5-17. When H-2D(d)K(d) transgenic H-2(b) lymphoma cells were i.p. inoculated into irradiated, H-2(b) splenocyte-transplanted H-2(b/d) mice, the infiltration of macrophages cytotoxic against H-2D(d)K(d) transgenic H-2(b) mouse skin epithelia (a GVHD activity) into the peritoneal cavity preceded several days the infiltration of interleukin (IL)-2-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to achieve a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. In contrast, allogeneic BM transplanted alone into the irradiated mice did not induce GVHD for 44 days, whereas i.v. injection of graft anti-host macrophages or graft anti-host CTLs along with allogeneic BM, respectively, induced GVHD or promoted the GVL effect in the absence of GVHD. These results revealed that macrophage-induced GVHD and the CTL-mediated GVL effect were a set (Th1: IFN-gamma/IL-2) response of the graft to allogeneic hosts and leukemia cells, respectively, and that graft T cell activation rather than inhibition skipped GVHD after BM transplantation.",,"['Yoshida, Ryotaro', 'Yamana, Hidenori', 'Hayashi, Michihiro', 'Yasuda, Emi', 'Shibayama, Yuro', 'Hirose, Yoshinobu', 'Tanigawa, Nobuhiko', 'Uchiyama, Kazuhisa', 'Kubota, Takahiro']","['Yoshida R', 'Yamana H', 'Hayashi M', 'Yasuda E', 'Shibayama Y', 'Hirose Y', 'Tanigawa N', 'Uchiyama K', 'Kubota T']","['Department of Physiology, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Research Laboratory, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of Physiology, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of General and Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of General and Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of General and Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of General and Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of Physiology, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Takatsuki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Th1', '*cytotoxic T lymphocyte', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia effect', '*macrophage']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2021/09/20 17:15'],"['2021/09/20 17:15 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2021.0032 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2021 Sep;41(9):310-318. doi: 10.1089/jir.2021.0032.,,,,9,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7399-4793'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The total cell production of MSC in patients with leukemia at the onset of the disease did not differ from that in the group of healthy donors. The relative expression of the IL6, TGFb1 and TGFb2, PPARG genes was similar in all patients. The relative expression of the JAG1, LIF, IGF1, CSF1, IL1b, and IL1bR1 genes in MSC of patients with leukemia was enhanced and the relative expression of SDF1 was unchanged in comparison with MSC from donors.

Two groups of patients who underwent abdominopelvic CT scans with RP-CT (n = 50) and DG-CT (n = 50) voluntarily participated in this study. The two groups of patients had approximately similar demographic features including mass, height, body mass index, sex, and age. Radiation dose parameters included CTDIvol, dose-length product, scan length, effective tube current, and pitch factor, all taken from the CT scanner console. The ImPACT software was used to calculate the patient-specific radiation doses. The risks of cancer incidence and mortality were estimated based on the BEIR VII report of the US National Research Council. In the RP-CT group, the mean +/- standard deviation of cancer incidence risk for all cancers, leukemia, and all solid cancers was 621.58 +/- 214.76, 101.59 +/- 27.15, and 516.60 +/- 189.01 cancers per 100,000 individuals, respectively, for male patients. For female patients, the corresponding risks were 742.71 +/- 292.35, 74.26 +/- 20.26, and 667.03 +/- 275.67 cancers per 100,000 individuals, respectively. In contrast, for DG-CT cancer incidence risks were 470.22 +/- 170.07, 78.23 +/- 18.22, and 390.25 +/- 152.82 cancers per 100,000 individuals for male patients, while they were 638.65 +/- 232.93, 62.14 +/- 13.74, and 575.73 +/- 221.21 cancers per 100,000 individuals for female patients. Cancer incidence and mortality risks were greater for RP-CT than for DG-CT scans. It is concluded that the various protocols of abdominopelvic CT scans, especially the RP-CT scans, should be optimized with respect to the radiation doses associated with these scans.","['(c) 2021.

Silent Sinus Syndrome (SSS) refers to a rare, asymptomatic condition whereby occlusion of the maxillary sinus ostium results in gradual resorption of air, creation of negative pressure and collapse of the maxillary walls. METHODS: Review of medical records and literature review using NCBI/PubMed. RESULTS: We describe a case of a 54-year-old gentleman presenting solely with enophthalmos. He had been diagnosed with stage IVa small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) 1.5 years prior to this, which was being managed with active surveillance. CT demonstrated severe bowing of the anterior and posterolateral wall, inferior displacement of the floor of the orbit and right enophthalmos, thus supporting a diagnosis of silent sinus syndrome. Compared to previous staging CT at the time of the lymphoma diagnosis these findings were entirely new, and soft tissue in the pterygomaxillary fissure was found to be enlarged. The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and a right maxillary mega-antrostomy was performed to ventilate the maxillary sinus and prevent progression of eye symptoms. A biopsy was taken from the pterygopalatine fossa, which was confirmed to be chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CONCLUSION: This case is unique both in being secondary to malignancy, as well as being rapidly progressive given the presence of radiologically normal appearances 1.5 years prior to presentation. Although a rare condition, prompt recognition of SSS is vital to prevent ophthalmological complications.

However, trial patients may not be representative of real-world patients (RWPs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RWP clinical factors associated with effectiveness and safety in CML patients treated with TKIs. METHODS: Patients with CML treated with at least 30 days of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib between 2014 and 2018 were included. Patients were stratified into categories based on the number of factors that would have precluded enrollment into pivotal TKI phase 3 trials (0, 1, >/=2). End points included complete hematologic response (CHR), early molecular response (EMR), major molecular response (MMR), adverse event (AE)-induced dose decreases, treatment interruptions, and treatment discontinuations. RESULTS: Final analyses included 174 patients. Patients with >/=2 factors had a higher risk of dose decreases (relative risk = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.02-2.34; P = 0.02) and a shorter time to dose decrease (hazard ratio = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.23-4.97; P = 0.006) compared with patients with 0 factors. Significant differences were observed in CHR at 1 month and MMR at 3 months between patients with 0 and >/=2 factors (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 60% of our RWPs would have been excluded from the pivotal phase 3 TKI trials.

Chemoresistant clones contributing to relapse arise from minimal residual disease (MRD) or newly-acquired mutations. However, the dynamics of clones comprising MRD is poorly understood. We developed a predictive stochastic model, based on a multitype age-dependent Markov branching process, to describe how random events in MRD contribute to the heterogeneity in treatment response. We employed training and validation sets of patients who underwent whole genome sequencing and for whom mutant clone frequencies at diagnosis and relapse were available. The disease evolution and treatment outcome are subject to stochastic fluctuations. Estimates of malignant clone growth rates, obtained by model fitting, are consistent with published data. Using the estimates from the training set, we developed a function linking MRD and time of relapse, with MRD inferred from the model fits to clone frequencies and other data. An independent validation set confirmed our model. In a third data set, we fitted the model to data at diagnosis and remission and predicted the time to relapse. As a conclusion, given bone marrow genome at diagnosis and MRD at or past remission, the model can predict time to relapse, and help guide treatment decisions to mitigate relapse.",,"['Dinh, Khanh N', 'Jaksik, Roman', 'Corey, Seth J', 'Kimmel, Marek']","['Dinh KN', 'Jaksik R', 'Corey SJ', 'Kimmel M']","['Irving Institute of Cancer Dynamics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Departments of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation and Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210914,United States,Comput Syst Oncol,Computational and systems oncology,101775780,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clonal evolution', 'minimal residual disease']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:01,['2021/09/20 06:24'],"['2022/09/14 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/09/20 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/cso2.1026 [doi]'],ppublish,Comput Syst Oncol. 2021 Sep;1(3). doi: 10.1002/cso2.1026.

However, the non-specific P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine (CsA) showed significant clinical benefits in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which likely represents the only proof-of-principle clinical trial using several generations of MDR inhibitors. Nevertheless, the mutational mechanisms that may underlie unsuccessful MDR modulation by CsA are not elucidated because of the absence of CsA-relevant cellular models. In this study, our aims were to establish CsA-resistant leukemia models and to examine the presence or absence of ABCB1 exonic mutations in these models as well as in diverse types of human cancer samples including AMLs. Methods: Drug-resistant lines were established by stepwise drug co-selection and characterized by drug sensitivity assay, rhodamine-123 accumulation, [(3)H]-labeled drug export, ABCB1 cDNA sequencing, and RNase protection assay. The genomic stability of the ABCB1 coding regions was evaluated by exome sequencing analysis of variant allele frequencies in human populations. Moreover, the mutational spectrum of ABCB1 was further assessed in diverse types of cancer samples including AMLs in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) at the National Cancer Institute. Results: We report the development of two erythroleukemia variants, RVC and RDC, which were derived by stepwise co-selection of K562/R7 drug-resistant leukemia cells with the etoposide-CsA and doxorubicin-CsA drug combinations, respectively. Interestingly, both RVC and RDC cell lines, which retained P-gp expression, showed altered multidrug-resistant phenotypes that were resistant to CsA modulation. Strikingly, no mutations were found in the ABCB1 coding regions in these variant cells even under long-term stringent drug selection. Genomically, ABCB1 displayed relatively low variant allele frequencies in human populations when compared with several ABC superfamily members. Moreover, ABCB1 also exhibited a very low mutational frequency in AMLs compared with all types of human cancer. In addition, we found that CsA played a role in undermining the selection of highly drug-resistant cells via induction of low-level and unstable drug resistance. Conclusion: Our data indicate that ABCB1 coding regions are genomically stable and relatively resistant to drug-induced mutations. Non-ABCB1 mutational mechanisms are responsible for the drug-resistant phenotypes in both RVC and RDC cell lines, which are also prevalent in clinical AML patients. Accordingly, we propose several relevant models that account for the development of alternative drug resistance mechanisms in the absence of ABCB1 mutations.",,"['Chen, Kevin G', 'Duran, George E', 'Mogul, Mark J', 'Wang, Yan C', 'Ross, Kevin L', 'Jaffrezou, Jean-Pierre', 'Huff, Lyn M', 'Johnson, Kory R', 'Fojo, Tito', 'Lacayo, Norman J', 'Sikic, Branimir I']","['Chen KG', 'Duran GE', 'Mogul MJ', 'Wang YC', 'Ross KL', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Huff LM', 'Johnson KR', 'Fojo T', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Sikic BI']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Current Address: NIH Stem Cell Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Current Address: Medical Affairs U.S., Servier Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA 02210, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Current Address: Ross BioPharm Group, Rocky Point, NY 11778, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Current Address: French National Centre for Scientific Research, Paris 75016, France.', 'Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Current Address, Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Intramural IT and Bioinformatics Program, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Current Address: Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology-Stem Cell Transplantation and Cancer Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine and Stanford Cancer Institute, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201103,United States,Cancer Drug Resist,"Cancer drug resistance (Alhambra, Calif.)",101738710,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'Cancer', 'P-glycoprotein', 'cyclosporine', 'leukemia', 'multidrug resistance', 'mutation']",2020/01/01 00:00,2020/01/01 00:01,['2021/09/20 06:21'],"['2021/09/20 06:21 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.20517/cdr.2020.51 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Drug Resist. 2020;3:959-979. doi: 10.20517/cdr.2020.51.

Multiple primary cancer always presents as solid cancer or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to lymphoma. Here, we report a rare case of secondary peripheral T-cell lymphoma and AML after Burkitt lymphoma treatment. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital complaining of edema on her left lower limb. Physical examination revealed multiple superficial lymphadenectasis on her neck and pelvis. Color ultrasonography examination showed multiple uterine fibroids and a solid mass at the lower left side of the abdomen. Pathological biopsy revealed Burkitt lymphoma. After three hyper-CVAD (A + B) regimens, she achieved complete remission. Two years later, lymphadenectasis reoccurred. A relevant biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which was accompanied by gastrointestinal invasion and hemocytopenia. Meanwhile, bone marrow examination revealed AML. On the second day of scheduled treatment, she developed gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, and hemorrhagic shock and was critically ill. She was then discharged from the hospital due to financial concerns. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of secondary peripheral T-cell lymphoma and AML after Burkitt lymphoma treatment with heterochronous and synchronal multiple primary cancers.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021.

Serious adverse reactions are uncommon compared with cytotoxic drugs. CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old man presented with general weakness and cytopenia. He had been taking erlotinib for 11 mo to treat NSCLC. The pathological diagnosis from the right upper lobe mass was adenocarcinoma with an EGFR mutation in exon 21 (L858R). He had previously received paclitaxel/carboplatin, gemcitabin/ vinorelbine chemotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastasis, and whole-brain radiotherapy as treatment for NSCLC. We diagnosed the patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During the induction and consolidation chemotherapy for AML, the erlotinib was discontinued. When complete remission of the AML was achieved, since the lung masses were increased, pemetrexed/ cisplatin for the NSCLC was initiated. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the cytopenia was prolonged. AML relapse occurred with the same karyotype. CONCLUSION: Therapy-related acute myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) is a rare but fatal late complication. Although a patient may be taking EGFR-TKIs, the possibility of t-MN should be considered. Further studies are needed to determine whether EGFR-TKI usage is a predisposing factor for t-MN.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

This adaptation requires DNA and histone epigenetic modifications, which are mediated by several types of enzymes; among them are lysine methyltransferases (KMTs). Methods: KMT inhibitors, chaetocin and tazemetostat (TZM), were used to study their role in the DDR induced by ionizing radiation or doxorubicin in two human sarcoma cells lines. The effect of these KMT inhibitors was tested by the analysis of chromatin epigenetic modifications, H4K16ac and H4K20me2. DDR was monitored by the formation of gammaH2AX, MDC1, NBS1 and 53BP1 foci, and the induction of apoptosis. Results: Chaetocin and tazemetostat treatments caused a significant increase of H4K16 acetylation, associated with chromatin relaxation, and increased DNA damage, detected by the labeling of free DNA-ends. These inhibitors significantly reduced H4K20 dimethylation levels in response to DNA damage and impaired the recruitment of 53BP1, but not of MDC1 and NBS1, at DNA damaged sites. This modification of epigenetic marks prevents DNA repair by the NHEJ pathway and leads to cell death. Conclusion: KMT inhibitors could function as sensitizers to DNA damage-based therapies and be used in novel synthetic lethality strategies for sarcoma treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Campillo-Marcos, Monte-Serrano, Navarro-Carrasco,', 'Garcia-Gonzalez and Lazo.']","['Campillo-Marcos, Ignacio', 'Monte-Serrano, Eva', 'Navarro-Carrasco, Elena', 'Garcia-Gonzalez, Raul', 'Lazo, Pedro A']","['Campillo-Marcos I', 'Monte-Serrano E', 'Navarro-Carrasco E', 'Garcia-Gonzalez R', 'Lazo PA']","['Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210903,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['53BP1 foci', 'DNA repair', 'H2AX foci', 'chaetocin', 'doxorubicin', 'histone methylation', 'ionizing radiation', 'tazemetostat']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:01,['2021/09/20 06:14'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/20 06:14 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.715126 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Sep 3;9:715126. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.715126. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8446283,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic aberration is one of the major causes contributing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where chromosomal rearrangements are frequently found. Increasing evidences have shown the pivotal roles of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in chromatin remodeling, which are involved in stemness maintenance, cell fate determination, proliferation and differentiation, via mastering the transcriptional switch of key genes. In abnormal, these functions can be bloomed to elicit carcinogenesis. Presently, HDAC family members are appealing targets for drug exploration, many of which have been deployed to the AML treatment. As the majority of AML events are associated with chromosomal translocation resulting in oncogenic fusion proteins, it is valuable to comprehensively understand the mutual interactions between HDACs and oncogenic proteins. Therefore, we reviewed the process of leukemogenesis and roles of HDAC members acting in this progress, providing an insight for the target anchoring, investigation of hyperacetylated-agents, and how the current knowledge could be applied in AML treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, Gao and Yu.']","['Zhang, Juan', 'Gao, Xuefeng', 'Yu, Li']","['Zhang J', 'Gao X', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210901,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'HDACs', 'chromosomal translocation', 'epigenetic modification', 'leukemogenesis', 'oncogenic fusion protein']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:01,['2021/09/20 06:13'],"['2021/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/20 06:13 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.741746 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 1;11:741746. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.741746. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8440836,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A clinical trial was conducted in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients using chidamide, decitabine, cytarabine, idarubicin, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, termed CDIAG, a double epigenetic priming regimen. Results: Thirty-five patients were recruited. Three patients received 2 treatment cycles. In 32 evaluable patients and 35 treatment courses, the completed remission rate (CRR) was 42.9%. The median OS time was 11.7 months. The median OS times of responders were 18.4 months, while those of nonresponders were 7.4 months (P = 0.015). The presence of RUNX1 mutations was associated with a high CRR but a short 2-year OS (P = 0.023) and PFS (P = 0.018) due to relapse after treatment. The presence of IDH mutations had no effect on the remission rate (80.0% vs. 73.3%), but showed a better OS (2-year OS rate: 100.0% vs. 28.9%). Grade 3/4 nonhematological adverse events included pneumonia, hematosepsis, febrile neutropenia, skin and soft tissue infection and others. Conclusion: The double epigenetic priming regimen (CDIAG regimen) showed considerably good antileukemia activity in these patients. Adverse events were acceptable according to previous experience.

In fact, due to heterogeneity, substantial rarity and absence of clinical trials, there are no therapeutic guidelines available. We investigated the genetic basis of 10 cases of ALAL diagnosed at our centre from 2008 and 2020, through a targeted myeloid and lymphoid sequencing approach. We show that this rare group of acute leukemias is enriched in myeloid-gene mutations. In particular we found that RUNX1 mutations, which have been found double mutated in 40% of patients and tend to involve both alleles, are associated with an undifferentiated phenotype and with lineage ambiguity. Furthermore, because this feature is typical of acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation, we believe that our data strengthen the idea that acute leukemia with ambiguous lineage, especially those with an undifferentiated phenotype, might be genetically more closer to acute myeloid leukemia rather than acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These data enrich the knowledge on the genetic basis of ALAL and could have clinical implications as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - oriented chemotherapeutic approach might be more appropriate.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Merati, Rossi, Galli, Roncoroni, Zibellini, Rizzo, Pietra,', 'Picone, Rocca, Cabrera, Gelli, Santacroce, Arcaini and Zappasodi.']","['Merati, Gabriele', 'Rossi, Marianna', 'Galli, Anna', 'Roncoroni, Elisa', 'Zibellini, Silvia', 'Rizzo, Ettore', 'Pietra, Daniela', 'Picone, Cristina', 'Rocca, Barbara', 'Cabrera, Claudia Patricia Tobar', 'Gelli, Eleonora', 'Santacroce, Eugenio', 'Arcaini, Luca', 'Zappasodi, Patrizia']","['Merati G', 'Rossi M', 'Galli A', 'Roncoroni E', 'Zibellini S', 'Rizzo E', 'Pietra D', 'Picone C', 'Rocca B', 'Cabrera CPT', 'Gelli E', 'Santacroce E', 'Arcaini L', 'Zappasodi P']","['Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'enGenome, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210831,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['Runx1', 'acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage', 'acute undifferentiated leukaemia', 'double mutations', 'myeloid genes']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:01,['2021/09/20 06:13'],"['2021/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/20 06:13 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.726637 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 31;11:726637. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.726637. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Author ER was employed by the company enGenome srl.

In order to rapidly and sensitively diagnose APML we intended to suggest a cost effective, sensitive FCM panel and also to prognositicate patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, flowcytometry characteristics of 123 cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia were studied including 40 hypogranular variants. The expression of markers was compared with the Mean flurescent Intensity (MFI) and percent expression of markers. A non-statistical comparison was made with cases of acute monocytic leukemia. The cases were grouped according to their immunophenotype characteristics and expression with comparison of MFI by multivariate logistic regression. The aberrant markers positive at diagnostic and remission flow test were compared with the survival outcomes, and their positive predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: The most common feature of side scatter property was the absence of blasts in the window and high side scatter, except hypogranular variants which had low side scatter. Immunophenotypically characterised by positivity for CD117, cMPO, and bright CD33 and CD13 positivity and lack of CD34 and HLA-DR was seen in the majority of APML including hypo-granular variant. We suggest a rapid diagnostic four-tube panel for fast and rapid diagnosis of APML, including hypogranular variants with 100% sensitivity. The study also identified six groups of immunophenotypes with significant prediction values of APML, including hypogranular variants. The study also highlights CD2, CD56, and CD9 as prognostic markers for acute promyelocytic leukemia.",['AJBR Copyright (c) 2021.'],"['Siraj, Fouzia', 'Tanwar, Pranay', 'Singh, Amitabh', 'Rishi, Bhavika', 'Ranjan, Amar', 'Chopra, Anita', 'Rai, Sandeep', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Misra, Aroonima']","['Siraj F', 'Tanwar P', 'Singh A', 'Rishi B', 'Ranjan A', 'Chopra A', 'Rai S', 'Bakhshi S', 'Misra A']","['ICMR-National Institute of Pathology, Safdarjung Hospital Campus Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, DR B R A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India.', 'ICMR-National Institute of Pathology, Safdarjung Hospital Campus Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, DR B R A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, DR B R A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, DR B R A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, DR B R A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'ICMR-National Institute of Pathology, Safdarjung Hospital Campus Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210815,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'flowcytometry', 'hypogranular variants', 'prognostication']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:01,['2021/09/20 06:09'],"['2020/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/20 06:09 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2021 Aug 15;11(4):446-457. eCollection 2021.,,,,4,"['A retrospective study from 2014-2019 of all the cases of APML after obtaining', 'consent from patients/guardians were evaluated for clinicopathological', 'parameters, flow cytometry, and cytochemistry.

Iron overload leads to damage to vital organs like the heart, liver, thyroid, Gonads, Pancreas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was done from June 2017-December 2019 in a tertiary care pediatric hematology oncology unit in northern India on children diagnosed with hematological malignancy and bone marrow failure syndromes receiving packed cell transfusion. After due ethical considerations and patient consent, the details were documented in predesigned proforma. All cases were planned to be investigated with Liver function test, Thyroid function test, Serum ferritin level, 2 D Echocardiography, Ultrasonography of abdomen, and MRI of the abdomen at admission and six months of enrollment. RESULTS: Out of 58 cases enrolled, ferritin levels were high in 65% of subjects at the start of treatment and 76% at the endpoint. Mean ferritin level was 725 ng/ml at baseline and 1268 ng/ml end of 6 month follow up period. Fifty-seven percent had a ferritin level above 1000 ng/ml, which correlated to basal ferritin level (P-value 0.005). The final ferritin level correlated strongly with the final number of packed cell transfusions (P-value 0.0002). Functional derangement of the liver was evident biochemically in 13.7% before starting treatment and 31.8% at six months follow-up period. Echocardiography detected diastolic dysfunction in 2% of patients at baseline before starting treatment and increased to 22% in 6 months follow-up period. The percentage of subclinical hypothyroidism increased from 22.8% to 48.8% during treatment. CONCLUSION: Like transfusion-dependent anemias, children with hematological malignancy and bone marrow failure syndrome on chronic transfusion are at risk of transfusion-related iron overload and organ damage.",['AJBR Copyright (c) 2021.'],"['Das, Samannay', 'Misra, Aroonima', 'Kashyap, Archana', 'Meena, Satish', 'Singh, Amitabh', 'Aggarwal, Kailash C']","['Das S', 'Misra A', 'Kashyap A', 'Meena S', 'Singh A', 'Aggarwal KC']","['Department of Pediatrics, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital New Delhi, India.', 'ICMR-National Institute of Pathology, Safdarjung Hospital Campus New Delhi, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital New Delhi, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital New Delhi, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210815,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,['NOTNLM'],"['BM failure', 'Blood transfusion', 'ferritin levels', 'iron overload', 'leukemia', 'pediatric patients']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:01,['2021/09/20 06:09'],"['2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/20 06:09 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2021 Aug 15;11(4):384-390. eCollection 2021.,,,,4,['None.'],,,PMC8446827,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis is poor and treatment options are limited in case of relapse. A comprehensive assessment of current disease burden and the clinical efficacy of non-intensive therapies in this population are lacking. We conducted two systematic literature reviews (SLRs). The first SLR (disease burden) included observational studies reporting the incidence and economic and humanistic burden of relapsed/refractory (RR) AML. The second SLR (clinical efficacy) included clinical trials (phase II or later) reporting remission rates (complete remission [CR] or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) and median overall survival (mOS) in patients with RR AML or patients with de novo AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. For both SLRs, MEDLINE((R))/Embase((R)) were searched from January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2020. Clinical trial registries were also searched for the clinical efficacy SLR. After screening, two independent reviewers determined the eligibility for inclusion in the SLRs based on full-text articles. The disease burden SLR identified 130 observational studies. The median cumulative incidence of relapse was 29.4% after stem cell transplant and 46.8% after induction chemotherapy. Total per-patient-per-month costs were $28,148-$29,322; costs and health care resource use were typically higher for RR versus non-RR patients. Patients with RR AML had worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores than patients with de novo AML across multiple instruments, and lower health utility values versus other AML health states (i.e. newly diagnosed, remission, consolidation, and maintenance therapy). The clinical efficacy SLR identified 50 trials (66 total trial arms). CR/CRi rates and mOS have remained relatively stable and low over the last 2 decades. Across all arms, the median rate of CR/CRi was 18.3% and mOS was 6.2 months. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients with AML will develop RR AML, which is associated with significant humanistic and economic burden.

A patient with leukaemia has a relative infection with pneumonia treated by fluoroquinolones as moxifloxacin HCL (MOX). Because opioid analgesic as nalbuphine HCL (NAL) does not have a ceiling dose, it is used to manage the distasteful sensory in leukaemia. Consequently, green methods for synchronous spectrofluorimetric quantification of a ternary mixture of ETO, MOX and NAL were developed. The first approach relies simply on the estimation of MOX at 371 nm by conventional synchronous fluorimetric technique (Deltalambda of 60 nm). The second approach depends on applying the first derivative synchronous fluorimetric technique (Deltalambda of 60 nm) for simultaneous estimation of ETO and NAL at 257 and 273 nm, respectively. A good linear correlation was obtained in the ranges of 0.04-0.40, 0.10-1.00 and 0.50-5.00 microg ml(-1) for MOX, ETO and NAL, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approaches were successfully applied for the estimation of the studied drugs in the pharmaceutical dosage forms. Additionally, the synchronous assessment of ETO, MOX and NAL in the spiked human urine was successfully attained by the facile protein precipitation technique.

Central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement and chemotherapy-related stroke are the most common causes. Hyperleukocytosis induced stroke is very rarely reported. Case presentation: A 2-year-old male child presented with hyperleukocytosis (leukocyte count was 320x10(9)/L). Bone marrow evaluation revealed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He was treated with dexamethasone, vincristine and daunorubicin, and on day 4 of chemotherapy, he developed abnormal movements, altered mental status, limb weakness and mutism. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multifocal infarctions involving left pons and both cerebellar hemispheres causing tonsillar herniation with restricted diffusion and mild hydrocephalus but no leptomeningeal enhancement or leukemic infiltrates. Magnetic resonance angiography did not show any arterial stenosis. He was intubated, sedated and managed conservatively with dexamethasone. Cytologic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid showed no blasts. Thrombophilia work up was negative. Five weeks later, the patient had significant improvement in overall neurologic status. He is free of leukemia. MRI showed interval resolution of previous infarcts. Clinical discussion: Hyperviscosity secondary to hyperleukocytosis was considered to be the most likely explanation for this patient stroke after excluding thrombophilia and leukemic infiltration. Prompt management with hydration and careful chemotherapy resulted in good outcome in our patient.

Icaritin is an active component of the genus Epimedium, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Icaritin has been shown to notably inhibit the growth of CML cells. To explore the potential mechanisms of inhibiting growth and inducing cell senescence in imatinib-resistant CML cells by icaritin, MTT assays were used to assess the cell viability. The apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were evaluated using flow cytometry. The SA-beta-Gal staining and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured using flow cytometry to detect the senescent cells. qRT-PCR was conducted to assess the expression of the cell cycle-associated proteins, and western blotting was used to analyze the expressions of the JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation proteins. The results showed that icaritin inhibited cell growth and induced cell senescence in imatinib-resistant CML cells, which is associated with the regulation of the JAK2/STAT3/P21 axis and accompanied by the accumulation of ROS.

Methods: The mRNA levels of PD-L1 and ERK in TCL samples were analyzed. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 69 TCL patients were collected to detect the expression of PD-L1 and p-ERK by multiplexed immunofluorescence staining. The total PD-L1 and p-ERK was measured by western blotting, and membrane PD-L1 was determined using flow cytometry. Results: PD-L1 and ERK mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in TCL. The expression rates of PD-L1 and p-ERK were 52.2% and 27.5%, respectively. PD-L1 expression correlated with stage (R=0.304, P=0.011) and IPI score (R=0.313, P=0.009), and p-ERK expression correlated with stage (R=0.330, P=0.006) and IPI score (R=0.376, P=0.002). PD-L1 expression positively correlated with p-ERK expression (R=0.355, P=0.003). Patients with co-expression of PD-L1 and p-ERK had the worst overall survival (P=0.007). In three TCL cell lines with PD-L1 expression, we demonstrated that the expression of p-ERK was upregulated after stimulation with PD-1, suggesting that ERK signaling was activated.

We found that LY3009120, a pan-RAF inhibitor, significantly decreased cell survival in RAS-mutated AML cell lines. We then investigated the synergistic effects of LY3009120 with either cytarabine or azacitidine. We found that the combination of low-dose cytarabine and LY3009120 showed a synergistic effect in NRAS-mutated HL-60 cells and KRAS-mutated NB4 cells. This effect was caused by a decrease in proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and cell growth arrest through a decrease in phosphorylated MEK and ERK along with a cytotoxic response occurring specifically for the RAS mutation of the pan-RAF inhibitor LY3009120.

After cerebral ischemia, Rfam sequence category revealed increased ribosomic RNA (rRNA) and decreased transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in plasma. Of the 2049 miRNAs detected after cerebral ischemia, 36 were upregulated, and 76 were downregulated (fold change >/=2.0, P < 0.05). For example, mml-miR-191-5p, miR-421, miR-409-5p, and let-7g-5p were found to be significantly overexpressed, whereas mml-miR-128a-5p_R - 2, miR-431_R - 1, and let-7g-3p_1ss22CT were significantly downregulated. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses revealed that these differentially expressed miRNAs were implicated in the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and signaling pathways in cancer, glioma, chronic myeloid leukemia, and chemokine signaling. miRNA clustering analysis showed that mml-let-7g-5p and let-7g-3p_1ss22CT, which share three target genes [RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 (RB1CC1), G-protein subunit gamma 5 (GNG5), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)], belong to one cluster, were altered in opposite directions following ischemia. These data suggest that circulating mml-let-7g may serve as a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Chen, Zhao, Huang, Li, Fan, Wang, Han, Yang, Wu, Wu, Luo and', 'Ji.']","['Chen, Jian', 'Zhao, Haiping', 'Huang, Yuyou', 'Li, Yuqian', 'Fan, Junfen', 'Wang, Rongliang', 'Han, Ziping', 'Yang, Zhenhong', 'Wu, Longfei', 'Wu, Di', 'Luo, Yumin', 'Ji, Xunming']","['Chen J', 'Zhao H', 'Huang Y', 'Li Y', 'Fan J', 'Wang R', 'Han Z', 'Yang Z', 'Wu L', 'Wu D', 'Luo Y', 'Ji X']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Cerebrovascular Diseases Research, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Cerebrovascular Diseases Research, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210901,Switzerland,Front Neurosci,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481,,['NOTNLM'],"['cerebral ischemia', 'let-7g-3p_1ss22CT', 'let-7g-5p', 'plasma', 'rhesus monkeys']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/09/21 06:01,['2021/09/20 06:00'],"['2021/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fnins.2021.738576 [doi]'],epublish,Front Neurosci. 2021 Sep 1;15:738576. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2021.738576. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8441133,,,,,,,,,,

They consist of intercellular channels termed ""connexions"", which can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation if dysregulated. This study aimed to evaluate the expression levels of the Cx32 and Cx43 genes and their correlations with other prognostic markers in patients with AML. Methods: This cross sectional study was performed on peripheral blood samples from 60 newly diagnosed patients with AML and 40 healthy control subjects at Kasr Alainy School of Medicine, Cairo University, from June 2016 to December 2017. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test was used to examine the relative expression level of Cx43 and Cx32 genes in the patients and the control subjects. The Chi square test or the Fisher exact test was employed to examine the relationship between qualitative variables, while the independent t test or the Mann-Whitney test was employed for quantitative data. All the tests were two-tailed, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among the patients with AML, 65% had a high Cx32 expression level, whereas 63.3% had a low Cx43 expression level. There was a statistically significant difference in the fold change values of Cx32 and Cx43 expression between the patient group and the control group (P=0.009 vs P=0.013, respectively). There was a remarkable association between both Cxs and CD34 and HLA-DR cells. Conclusion: Cx expression in samples may add to the diagnostic workup of AML. Although we found a negative correlation between Cx43 expression and the peripheral blood blast percentage, the response after the first induction of chemotherapy showed no significant relationship with Cx43 and Cx32.",['Copyright: (c) Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences.'],"['Fateen, Mohamed', 'Seif, Alia', 'Salama, Rasha', 'Shams, Ahmed', 'Amin, Dalia']","['Fateen M', 'Seif A', 'Salama R', 'Shams A', 'Amin D']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Med Sci,Iranian journal of medical sciences,8104374,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['* Gap junctions', '* Gene expression', '* Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Connexin 43']",2021/09/21 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2021/09/20 05:53'],"['2020/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/20 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.30476/ijms.2020.84511.1477 [doi]', 'IJMS-46-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Iran J Med Sci. 2021 Sep;46(5):347-354. doi: 10.30476/ijms.2020.84511.1477.,20211026,"['0 (Connexin 43)', '0 (Connexins)', '0 (GJA1 protein, human)', '0 (connexin 32)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Connexin 43/*analysis/genetics', 'Connexins/*analysis/genetics', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors']",5,,,,PMC8438339,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a 67-year-old patient with long-standing untreated B1 thymoma that presented with constitutional symptoms and a painless soft tissue mass on the right chest wall. Pathological analysis of the biopsy from the mass demonstrated T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. The patient went through a complicated course, was refractory to several lines of therapy, and eventually underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in complete remission from a matched related donor. The association between thymoma and malignant neoplasms has been described in the literature, most notably with colorectal adenocarcinoma and thyroid cancer. Thymoma-associated leukemia is, however, extremely unusual, with limited reports in the literature. Distinguishing between thymoma and leukemia can be challenging and often requires meticulous diagnostic efforts. For patients with a past history of thymoma, awareness of this particular association should be bared in mind to allow earlier diagnosis and therapy.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by S.

However, Dox use is restricted due to inherent and acquired resistance and an 8-fold increase in the risk of potentially fatal cardiotoxicity. Hybrid cyclic-linear peptide [R5K]W7A and linear peptide R5KW7A were conjugated with Dox through a glutarate linker to afford [R5K]W7A-Dox and R5KW7A-Dox conjugates to generate Dox derivatives. Alternatively, [R5K]W7C was conjugated with Dox via a disulfide linker to generate [R5K]W7C-S-S-Dox conjugate, where S-S is a disulfide bond. Comparative antiproliferative assays between conjugates [R5K]W7A-Dox, [R5K]W7C-S-S-Dox, linear R5KW7A-Dox, the corresponding physical mixtures of the peptides, and Dox were performed in normal and cancer cells. [R5K]W7A-Dox conjugate was 2-fold more efficient than R5KW7A-Dox, and [R5K]W7C-S-S-Dox conjugates in inhibiting the cell proliferation of human leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM). Therefore, hybrid cyclic-linear [R5K]W7A-Dox conjugate was selected for further studies and inhibited the cell viability of CCRF-CEM (84%), ovarian adenocarcinoma (SK-OV-3, 39%), and gastric carcinoma (AGS, 73%) at a concentration of 5 muM after 72 h of incubation, which was comparable to Dox (5 muM) efficacy (CCRF-CEM (85%), SK-OV-3 (33%), and AGS (87%)). While [R5K]W7A-Dox had a significant effect on the viability of cancer cells, it exhibited minimal cytotoxicity to normal kidney (LLC-PK1, 5-7%) and heart cells (H9C2, <9%) at concentrations of 5-10 muM (compared to free Dox at 5 muM that reduced the viability of kidney and heart cells by 85% and 44%, respectively). The fluorescence microscopy images were consistent with the cytotoxicity studies, indicating minimal uptake of the cyclic-linear [R5K]W7A-Dox (5 muM) in H9C2 cells. In comparison, Dox (5 muM) showed significant uptake, reduced cell viability, and changed the morphology of the cells after 24 h. [R5K]W7A-Dox showed 16-fold and 9.5-fold higher activity against Dox-resistant cells MDA231R and MES-SA/MX2 (lethal dose for 50% cell death or LC50 of 2.3 and 4.3 muM, respectively) compared to free Dox (LC50 of 36-41 muM, respectively). These data, along with the results obtained from the cell viability tests, indicate comparable efficiency of [R5K]W7A-Dox to free Dox in leukemia, ovarian, and gastric cancer cells, significantly reduced toxicity in normal kidney LLC-PK1 and heart H9C2 cells, and significantly higher efficiency in Dox-resistant cells.

Among the 264 patients, 180 (68%) received a BM graft and 84 (32%) received a PB graft. The median patient age was 50 years in both groups. The majority (n = 199; 75%) received reduced-intensity conditioning. The rate of acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome was higher in the BM graft recipients compared with the PB graft recipients (85% [n = 152] versus 55% [n = 46]; P < .01). The median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment and the incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) were comparable in the 2 groups.

Because of this reason, the objective of current study is to explore whether XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism confers risk to leukemia. METHODS: Two independent authors systematically and comprehensively searched Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane library, Google academic, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Search time is from database foundation to March 2021. RESULTS: Overall, significant associations between leukemia risk and XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism were found in Caucasian population by allele contrast (T vs. C: OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.40), homozygote comparison (TT vs. CC: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05-1.73), and recessive genetic model (TT vs. TC/CC: OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.64).

This review evaluates how much asparaginase is needed for optimal outcome in childhood ALL. We provide an overview of asparaginase dose intensity, i.e. duration of total cumulative exposure in weeks and level of exposure reflected by dose and/or asparaginase activity level, and the corresponding outcome. We systematically searched papers published between January 1990 and March 2021 in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases and included 20 papers. The level and duration of exposure were based on the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug and the assumption that trough asparaginase activity levels of >/=100 IU/L should be achieved for complete l-asparagine depletion. The statistical meta-analysis of outcomes was not performed because different outcome measures were used. The level of exposure was not associated with the outcome as long as therapeutic asparaginase activity levels of >/=100 IU/L were reached. Conflicting results were found in the randomised controlled trials, but all truncation studies showed that the duration of exposure (expressed as weeks of l-asparagine depletion) does affect the outcome; however, no clear cutoff for optimal exposure duration was determined. Optimal exposure duration will also depend on immunophenotype, (cyto)genetic subgroups, risk group stratification and backbone therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Mono- and di-methylation of H3K36 by NSD1 is mainly primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, alternative splicing, and other important biological processes. Many types of cancers, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), liver cancer, lung cancer, endometrial carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer, are associated with NSD1 fusion, missense mutation, nonsense mutation, silent mutation, deletion, and insertion of frameshift, and deletion in a frame. Therefore, targeting NSD1 may be a potential strategy for tumor therapy.

It is urgent to understand the microenvironment to improve therapy and prognosis. METHODS: Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze transcription expression profile of AML patient samples with complete clinical information from UCSC Xena TCGA-AML datasets and validate with GEO datasets. Western blot, qPCR, RNAi and CCK8 assay were used to assay the effect of GPX1 expression on AML cell viability and the expression of genes of interest. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that highly expressed GPX1 in AML patients links to unfavorable prognosis. GPX1 expression was positively associated with not only fraction levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), monocytes and T cell exhaustion, the expression levels of MDSC markers, MDSC-promoting CCR2 and immune inhibitory checkpoints (TIM3/Gal-9, SIRPalpha and VISTA), but also negatively with low fraction levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Silencing GPX1 expression reduced AML cell viability and CCR2 expression. Moreover, GPX1-targetd kinases were PKC family, SRC family, SYK and PAK1, which promote AML progression and the resistance to therapy. Furthermore, Additionally, GPX1-associated prognostic signature (GPS) is an independent risk factor with high area under curve (AUC) values of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. High risk group based on GPS enriched not only with endocytosis which transfers mitochondria to favor AML cell survival in response to chemotherapy, but also NOTCH, WNT and TLR signaling which promote therapy resistance.

The routine use of next-generation sequencing in the clinic has facilitated the identification of an ever-increasing number of inborn errors of immunity, revealing the roles of immunologically important genes in human pathologies. However, despite this progress, treatment is still extremely challenging. OBJECTIVE: We sought to report a new monogenic autoinflammatory disorder caused by a de novo activating mutation, p.Tyr515 *, in hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK). The disease is characterized by cutaneous vasculitis and chronic pulmonary inflammation that progresses to fibrosis. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, mass spectrometry, and western blotting were performed to identify and characterize the pathogenic HCK mutation. Dysregulation of mutant HCK was confirmed ex vivo in primary cells and in vitro in transduced cell lines. RESULTS: Mutant HCK lacking the C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine Tyr522 exhibited increased kinase activity and enhanced myeloid cell priming, migration and effector functions, such as production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha, and production of reactive oxygen species. These aberrant functions were reflected by inflammatory leukocyte infiltration of the lungs and skin. Moreover, an overview of the clinical course of the disease, including therapies, provides evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of the Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in inflammatory lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: We propose HCK-driven pulmonary and cutaneous vasculitis as a novel autoinflammatory disorder of inborn errors of immunity.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

This reflects the fact that HSCT is currently the only curative treatment, capable of inducing prolonged disease-free survival. Nevertheless, several problems prevent more patients from undergoing an allogeneic HSCT: we will be discussing indications for HSCT, comorbidities, splenomegaly, older age and disease phase.

Nevertheless, the clinical relevancy of immune signals in patients with MDS remains elusive. To address this, we used single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis to score immune signatures of bone marrow (BM) samples from 176 patients with primary MDS. Enhanced signatures of 'immature dendritic cells' and 'natural killer cells with cluster of differentiation (CD)56(bright') were correlated with better overall survival (OS), whilst higher 'CD103(+) signature' was associated with reduced survival. An MDS-Immune-Risk (MIR) scoring system was constructed based on the weighted sums derived from Cox regression analysis. High MIR scores were correlated with higher revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) scores and mutations in ASXL transcriptional regulator 1 (ASXL1), Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), and tumour protein p53 (TP53). High-score patients had significantly inferior leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and OS than low-score patients. The prognostic significance of MIR scores for survival remained valid across IPSS-R subgroups and was validated in two independent cohorts. Multivariable analysis revealed that a higher MIR score was an independent adverse risk factor for LFS and OS. We further proposed a model with the combination of MIR score and gene mutations to be complementary to IPSS-R for the prognostication of LFS and OS of patients with MDS.",['(c) 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wang, Yu-Hung', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Yao, Chi-Yuan', 'Hsu, Chia-Lang', 'Tsai, Cheng-Hong', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Wang YH', 'Lin CC', 'Yao CY', 'Hsu CL', 'Tsai CH', 'Hou HA', 'Chou WC', 'Tien HF']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210918,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,,2021/09/19 06:00,2021/09/19 06:00,['2021/09/18 08:35'],"['2021/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/18 08:35 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17837 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2022 Jan;196(1):156-168. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17837.

In order to clarify the association, the publications in English that provided information about maternal antibiotic exposure during pregnancy and ALL risk in offspring in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically reviewed and we performed a meta-analysis using the random-effect models. Results of pooled analysis showed that maternal antibiotic intake during pregnancy is not associated with childhood ALL risk (pooled odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.18) without significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 13.7%, P = 0.310). This finding was consistent across subgroups stratified by type of study design, measurement method, sample size, study quality, and pregnancy stage. Our findings suggest that maternal antibiotic consumption during pregnancy was not associated with ALL risk in progeny. Further investigations are needed to confirm the results and assess any risk differences of ALL by types of antibiotics.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that maternal antibiotics consumption during pregnancy was not associated with ALL risk in progeny. Further investigations are needed to confirm the results and assess any risk differences of ALL by types of antibiotics. What is Known: * It is not unusual for pregnant woman to receive antibiotics for local or systematic use during pregnancy. * The conclusions regarding the associations between maternal antibiotics use during pregnancy and childhood ALL risk were inconsistent. What is New: * Maternal antibiotics consumption during pregnancy was not associated with the increased ALL risk in offspring. * Further laboratory evidences are needed to confirm the results.","['(c) 2021.

We demonstrate that compound heterozygous loss of multiple genes critical for B and T cell development drives transformation, including Pax5(+/-)xEbf1(+/-), Pax5(+/-)xIkzf1(+/-), and Ebf1(+/-)xIkzf1(+/-) mice for B-ALL, or Tcf7(+/-)xIkzf1(+/-) mice for T-ALL. To identify genetic defects that cooperate with Pax5 and Ebf1 compound heterozygosity to initiate leukemia, we performed a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon screen that identified cooperating partners including gain-of-function mutations in Stat5b (~65%) and Jak1 (~68%), or loss-of-function mutations in Cblb (61%) and Myb (32%). These findings underscore the role of JAK/STAT5B signaling in B cell transformation and demonstrate roles for loss-of-function mutations in Cblb and Myb in transformation. RNA-Seq studies demonstrated upregulation of a PDK1>SGK3>MYC pathway; treatment of Pax5(+/-)xEbf1(+/-) leukemia cells with PDK1 inhibitors blocked proliferation in vitro. In addition, we identified a conserved transcriptional gene signature between human and murine leukemias characterized by upregulation of myeloid genes, most notably involving the GM-CSF pathway, that resemble a B cell/myeloid mixed-lineage leukemia. Thus, our findings identify multiple mechanisms that cooperate with defects in B cell transcription factors to generate either progenitor B cell or mixed B/myeloid-like leukemias.","['(c) 2021.

Here we demonstrate that Pin1 is a key cellular molecule necessary for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) propagation. In this study, siRNA-mediated silencing of Pin1 expression markedly suppressed the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. In addition, several recently generated Pin1 inhibitors showed strong inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 proliferation, measured by both viral mRNA and protein synthesis, and alleviated the cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. One compound, termed H-77, was found to block SARS-CoV-2 proliferation at an EC50 below 5 muM regardless of whether it was added to the culture medium prior to or after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The inhibition of viral N protein mRNA synthesis by H-77 implies that the molecular mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is likely to be associated with viral gene transcription or earlier steps. Another Pin1 inhibitor, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-a commercially available drug used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and which both activates the retinoic acid receptor and inhibits the activity of Pin1-similarly reduced the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, the results indicate that Pin1 inhibitors could serve as potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19.",['(c) 2021.

Here, we show that Bone Marrow (BM) adipocytes dynamically evolve during ALL pathogenesis and therapy, transitioning from cellular depletion in the primary leukaemia niche to a fully reconstituted state upon remission induction. Functionally, adipocyte niches elicit a fate switch in ALL cells towards slow-proliferation and cellular quiescence, highlighting the critical contribution of the adipocyte dynamic to disease establishment and chemotherapy resistance. Mechanistically, adipocyte niche interaction targets posttranscriptional networks and suppresses protein biosynthesis in ALL cells. Treatment with general control nonderepressible 2 inhibitor (GCN2ib) alleviates adipocyte-mediated translational repression and rescues ALL cell quiescence thereby significantly reducing the cytoprotective effect of adipocytes against chemotherapy and other extrinsic stressors. These data establish how adipocyte driven restrictions of the ALL proteome benefit ALL tumours, preventing their elimination, and suggest ways to manipulate adipocyte-mediated ALL resistance.",['(c) 2021.

This study aimed to compare the nephrotoxicity associated with L-AmB in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 112 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia patients who received treatment with L-AmB (Ambisome(R)) at the University of Health Sciences Dr Behcet Uz Children's Hospital over 7 years were included. The incidence of hypokalemia, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate and presence of acute kidney injury was recorded. RESULTS: The average L-AmB treatment duration was 17.1+/-15.0 days. Five patients (4.4%) of the patients had grade I acute renal injury according to KDIGO criteria and 16 patients (14.2%) had increased risk for kidney injury according to RIFLE criteria. There were no patients with eGFR decrease above 50% and no renal injury and failure were observed during L-AmB treatment. The rate of patients with hypokalemia in the pre-treatment was 17.9% and the post-L-AmB group was 50.0%. The rate of hypokalemia was higher in the post-treatment group (P=0.0015). Among the 112 patients, only two patients (1.7%) required cessation of L-AmB treatment due to resistant hypokalemia despite supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia was more common compared to glomerulotoxicity and acute renal injury (according to KDIGO and RIFLE criteria) in pediatric leukemia patients treated with L-AmB. Hypokalemia developed in nearly half of the patients and the study shows the need for randomized controlled trials and strategies for hypokalemia associated with L-AmB treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Societe francophone de nephrologie, dialyse et', 'transplantation.

Repeated purine analogs achieve decreasing efficacy and increasing toxicity, particularly to normal T-cells. MRD-free complete remissions (CRs) are more common using rituximab with purine analogs in both 1(st)-line and relapsed settings. BRAF inhibitors and Ibrutinib can achieve remission, but due to persistence of MRD, must be used chronically to prevent relapse. BRAF inhibition combined with Rituximab can achieve high MRD-free CR rates. Anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin moxetumomab pasudotox is FDA-approved in the relapsed setting and is unique in achieving high MRD-free CR rates as a single-agent.

Unlike other cancer types, diagnosis of MPNs requires a combination of microscopic, clinical and genetic evidence, which provide unique challenges given the typical notification processes of cancer registries. This, and the relatively recent advances in diagnosis and revision of the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria, may result in under-diagnosis or under-reporting of MPNs. We used population-based cancer registry data from the Australian Cancer Database and modelled the incidence and survival of MPNs between 2007 and 2016 using generalised linear models and Bayesian spatial Leroux models. Substantial evidence was found of spatial heterogeneity in the incidence of MPNs and significant differences in incidence and survival by state or territory. States with lower incidence tended to have poorer survival, suggesting that some less severe cases may not be diagnosed or notified to the registries in those states. Population rates of genetic testing and percentages of records diagnosed using bone marrow biopsies did not explain the differences in incidence by state and territory. It is important to determine the key drivers of these geographical patterns, including the need to standardise diagnosis and reporting of MPNs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which is negatively regulated by the BIN1 proto-oncogene, is an interferon-gamma-inducible mediator of immune tolerance. With the aim to develop a prognostic IDO1-based immune gene signature, biological and clinical data of 982 patients with newly diagnosed, nonpromyelocytic AML were retrieved from public datasets and analyzed using established computational pipelines. Targeted transcriptomic profiles of 24 diagnostic BM samples were analyzed using the NanoString's nCounter platform. BIN1 and IDO1 were inversely correlated and individually predicted overall survival. PLXNC1, a semaphorin receptor involved in inflammation and immune response, was the IDO1-interacting gene retaining the strongest prognostic value. The incorporation of PLXNC1 into the 2-gene IDO1-BIN1 score gave rise to a powerful immune gene signature predicting survival, especially in patients receiving chemotherapy. The top differentially expressed genes between IDO1lowand IDO-1high and between PLXNC1lowand PLXNC1high cases further improved the prognostic value of IDO1 providing a 7- and 10-gene immune signature, highly predictive of survival and correlating with AML mutational status at diagnosis. Taken together, our data indicate that IDO1 is pivotal for the construction of an immune gene signature predictive of survival in AML patients. Given the emerging role of immunotherapies for AML, our findings support the incorporation of immune biomarkers into current AML classification and prognostication algorithms.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

Our aim was to establish PS29MRC as a clinically usable assay by using the widely implemented NanoString platform and further validate the classifier in a more recently treated patient cohort. Analyses were performed on 351 patients with newly diagnosed AML intensively treated within the German AML Cooperative Group registry. As a continuous variable, PS29MRC performed best in predicting induction failure in comparison with previously published risk models. The classifier was strongly associated with overall survival. We were able to establish a previously defined cutoff that allows classifier dichotomization (PS29MRCdic). PS29MRCdic significantly identified induction failure with 59% sensitivity, 77% specificity, and 72% overall accuracy (odds ratio, 4.81; P = 4.15 x 10-10). PS29MRCdic was able to improve the European Leukemia Network 2017 (ELN-2017) risk classification within every category. The median overall survival with high PS29MRCdic was 1.8 years compared with 4.3 years for low-risk patients. In multivariate analysis including ELN-2017 and clinical and genetic markers, only age and PS29MRCdic were independent predictors of refractory disease. In patients aged >/=60 years, only PS29MRCdic remained as a significant variable. In summary, we confirmed PS29MRC as a valuable classifier to identify high-risk patients with AML. Risk classification can still be refined beyond ELN-2017, and predictive classifiers might facilitate clinical trials focusing on these high-risk patients with AML.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

We assembled a cohort of 745 patients with cGVHD treated with initial systemic immune suppressive (IS) therapy from 3 prior cGVHD Consortium observational studies. Initial therapy was defined as first IS therapy started for cGVHD or prednisone increased to >/=0.4 mg/kg per day from lower doses within 30 days before cGVHD diagnosis to any time afterward. Initial therapies were nonprednisone IS therapies (n = 137, 18%), prednisone alone (n = 411, 55%), or prednisone plus other IS therapy (n = 197, 26%). In multivariate analysis, initial therapy group was not associated with failure-free survival (FFS; a composite of death, relapse, and new IS therapy), overall survival (OS), or nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Among the prednisone-based approaches, steroid dose was <0.25 (9%), 0.25 to 0.74 (36%), 0.75 to 1.25 (42%), or >1.25 mg/kg per day (13%). Prednisone dose within the patients treated with steroids was not significantly associated with FFS, OS, or NRM. No significant interactions were detected between overall cGVHD severity and either initial therapy group or prednisone dose for the outcomes of FFS, OS, or NRM. These observational data document heterogeneity in more contemporary cGVHD initial treatment practices, including prednisone dose and use of nonsteroid approaches. This variation was not associated with FFS, OS, or NRM. Prospective trials are needed to verify efficacy of reduced-dose prednisone or prednisone-free initial therapy approaches.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Asparaginase depletes serum asparagine by deamination into aspartic acid. Normal hematopoietic cells can survive due to asparagine synthetase (ASNS) activity, whereas leukemia cells are supposed to undergo apoptosis due to silencing of the ASNS gene. Because the ASNS gene has a typical CpG island in its promoter, its methylation status in T-ALL cells may be associated with asparaginase sensitivity. Thus, we investigated the significance of ASNS methylation status in asparaginase sensitivity of T-ALL cell lines and prognosis of childhood T-ALL. Sequencing of bisulfite polymerase chain reaction products using next-generation sequencing technology in 22 T-ALL cell lines revealed a stepwise allele-specific methylation of the ASNS gene, in association with an aberrant methylation of a 7q21 imprinted gene cluster. T-ALL cell lines with ASNS hypermethylation status showed significantly higher in vitro l-asparaginase sensitivity in association with insufficient asparaginase-induced upregulation of ASNS gene expression and lower basal ASNS protein expression. A comprehensive analysis of diagnostic samples from pediatric patients with T-ALL in Japanese cohorts (N = 77) revealed that methylation of the ASNS gene was associated with an aberrant methylation of the 7q21 imprinted gene cluster. In pediatric T-ALL patients in Japanese cohorts (n = 75), ASNS hypomethylation status was significantly associated with poor therapeutic outcome, and all cases with poor prognostic SPI1 fusion exclusively exhibited ASNS hypomethylation status. These observations show that ASNS hypomethylation status is associated with asparaginase resistance and is a poor prognostic biomarker in childhood T-ALL.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

Currently it is poorly understood how and when CD8+ alphabeta T cells exert graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity after DLI. Also, there is no reliable biomarker to monitor GVL activity of the infused CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we analyzed the dynamics of CD8+ alphabeta T-cell clones in patients with DLI. In this prospective clinical study of 29 patients, we performed deep T-cell receptor beta (TRB ) sequencing of sorted CD8+ alphabeta T cells to track patients' repertoire changes in response to DLI. Upon first occurrence of GVL, longitudinal analyses revealed a preferential expansion of distinct CD8+TRB clones (n = 14). This did not occur in samples of patients without signs of GVL (n = 11). Importantly, early repertoire changes 15 days after DLI predicted durable remission for the 36-month study follow-up. Furthermore, absence of clonal outgrowth of the CD8+TRB repertoire after DLI was an early biomarker that predicted relapse at a median time of 11.2 months ahead of actual diagnosis. Additionally, unbiased sample analysis regardless of the clinical outcome revealed that patients with decreasing CD8+TRB diversity at day 15 after DLI (n = 13) had a lower relapse incidence (P = .0040) compared with patients without clonal expansion (n = 6). In conclusion, CD8+TRB analysis may provide a reliable tool for predicting the efficacy of DLI and holds the potential to identify patients at risk for progression and relapse after DLI.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

This review outlines the most recent advances in the detection and prevention of AML relapse following allogeneic HCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Conventional methods for predicting post-HCT relapse rely on the molecular and cytogenetics features present at diagnosis. These methods are slow to reflect a growing understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of AML and impact of new therapies on post-HCT outcomes. The use of measurable residual disease (MRD) techniques, including multiparameter flow cytometry and molecular testing, may improve the prognostic ability of these models and should be incorporated into post-HCT surveillance whenever possible.In the post-HCT setting, FLT3 inhibitor maintenance data indicate that effective therapies can improve post-HCT outcomes. Maintenance data with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor monotherapy is less compelling and outcomes may improve with combinations. Early interventions directed at preemptive management of MRD may further improve post-HCT outcomes. SUMMARY: Post-HCT AML relapse prevention has evolved to include more sensitive measures of disease detection and novel therapies that may improve outcomes of poor-risk AML patients. Additional work is needed to maintain this progress.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In resource-limited countries lacking TBI facilities; however, ALL patients undergo radiation-free myeloablative conditioning, though its impacts on post-HSCT outcomes of the patients with pre-HSCT CNS involvement have not been analyzed. In this 14-year series of 278 adult (> 18 y) ALL patients undergoing TBI-free busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning allo-HSCT, we found that the long-term probabilities of overall survival, disease free survival, relapse and non-relapse mortality were not significantly different between CNS-involved and CNS-spared patients. Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of post-HSCT CNS relapse between CNS-involved and CNS-spared patients. Pre-HSCT cranial radiation therapy (CRT) showed no significant preventive effect on the likelihood of post-HSCT CNS relapse.

The hypothesis for this study is that next-generation sequencing with sequential digestion of genomic DNA with SmaI and XmaI enzymes could provide highly quantitative information on methylation levels in cats. Using blood from four healthy control cats and two disease cats as well as three feline lymphoma/leukemia cell lines, approximately 74-94 thousand CpG sites across the cat genome could be analysed. CpG sites in CpG island (CGI) were broadly either methylated or unmethylated in normal blood, while CpG sites in non-CpG islands (NCGI) are largely methylated. Lymphoma cell lines showed thousands of CpG sites with gain of methylation at normally unmethylated CGI sites and loss of methylation at normally methylated NCGI sites. Hypermethylated CpG sites located at promoter regions included genes annotated with 'developmental process' and 'anatomical structure morphogenesis' such as HOXD10.

The carboxamides and ureates were synthesized by converting 5-(aryl)-isoxzaole-3-carbohydrazides 1a,b to the corresponding carbonylazides 2a,b followed by treatment with the appropriate amines. The hydrazones were directly obtained through condensation of the carbohydrazide 1a,b with aldehydes and/or ketones. The structures of the target compounds were confirmed by elemental and spectral analyses. A preliminary in vitro anticancer screening of solutions (10(-5)M) on 60 cancer cell lines (NCI, USA) revealed that the carboxamide 3c is the most promising growth inhibitor. Explicitly, 3c showed potent anticancer activity at 10micro M against leukemia (HL-60(TB), K-562 and MOLT-4), colon cancer (KM12) and melanoma (LOX IMVI) cell lines with %GI range = 70.79-92.21. Evaluation of growth inhibitory activity of the synthesized compounds against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), that overexpresses VEGFR2, showed superior activity of compounds 8, 10a and 10c with IC50 in sub micromolar concentrations of 0.84, 0.79 and 0.69 muM, respectively, which is better than that of the reference drug, Sorafenib (IC50 = 3.99 microM). Moreover, these compounds displayed high selective cytotoxicity for HepG2 cancer cells over the nontumorigenic THLE2 liver cells (SI range = 26.37-38.60) which reflect their safety. The results of VEGFR2 kinase inhibition assay demonstrate that, compounds 8 and 10a are the most active inhibitors with IC50 = 25.7 and 28.2 nM, respectively, (Sorafenib IC50 = 28.1 nM). Molecular docking of the synthesized derivatives to VEGFR2 (PDB: 3WZE) showed similar binding modes to that of the co-crystallized ligand, sorafenib. Moreover, the results of computational assessment of ADME and drug-likeness characteristics inspire further investigations of the new isoxazole-based derivatives to afford more potent, safe and orally active VEGFR2 inhibitors as potential anticancer drug candidates.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Identification of the t(15;17)(PML-RARA) chromosomal translocation through conventional cytogenetics fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or detection of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion through RT-PCR represent the current standard of care for diagnosing APL. However, about 1-2% of patients with APL have a variant translocation involving other fusion partners with RARalpha besides PML. These patients present a unique diagnostic and clinical challenge in that conventional cytogenetics in addition to FISH and/or RT-PCR for PML-RARalpha may fail to identify these clinically relevant genetic lesions leading to an inappropriate diagnosis and treatment. We present two cases of patients who had APL with variant translocations whose bone marrow specimens were sent to the University of Michigan for enrollment in the MI-ONCOSEQ study (HUM00067928) after standard testing failed to identify PML-RARalpha or t(15;17) despite a phenotypic concern for this diagnosis. In these two patients, whole exome and transcriptome profiling via the MI-ONCOSEQ platform identified a PRKAR1A-RARalpha fusion in one patient and ZBTB16-RARalpha fusion in another patient. These cases illustrate the utility of whole exome and transcriptome profiling in diagnosing variant translocations in patients in whom there is a high clinical suspicion for APL based on hematopathology review.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

We hypothesised that frontline time-limited, minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided triplet therapy with acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab would induce deep (ie, more patients with undetectable MRD) and durable remissions. METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm, investigator-sponsored, phase 2 study, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma were recruited from two academic hospitals in Boston, MA, USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and were treatment naive. Patients were treated in 28 day cycles. Acalabrutinib monotherapy was given orally at 100 mg twice daily for cycle 1, then combined for six cycles with intravenous obinutuzumab (100 mg on cycle 2 day 1, 900 mg on day 2, 1000 mg on day 8, and 1000 mg on day 15 and on day 1 of cycles 3-7); and from the beginning of cycle 4, oral venetoclax was dosed daily using an accelerated ramp-up from 20 mg on day 1 to 400 mg by day 22 and continued at this dose thereafter. Patients continued on acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily and venetoclax 400 mg once daily until day 1 of cycle 16 or day 1 of cycle 25. If the patient had undetectable MRD in the bone marrow they were given the option to discontinue therapy at the start of cycle 16 (if also in complete remission) or at the start of cycle 25 (if at least in partial remission). The primary endpoint was complete remission with undetectable MRD in the bone marrow (defined as <1 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell per 10 000 leucocytes as measured by four-colour flow cytometry), at cycle 16 day 1. Safety and activity endpoints were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of any study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03580928, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Aug 2, 2018, and May 23, 2019, 37 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were enrolled and all received at least one dose of any study drug. The median age of patients was 63 years (IQR 57-70), and ten (27%) were female and 27 (73%) were male. Median follow-up was 27.6 months (IQR 25.1-28.2). At cycle 16 day 1, 14 (38% [95% CI 22-55]) of 37 participants had a complete remission with undetectable MRD in the bone marrow. The most common grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse event was neutropenia (16 [43%] of 37 patients). The most common grade 3-4 non-haematological adverse events were hyperglycaemia (three [8%]) and hypophosphataemia (three [8%]). Serious adverse events occurred in nine (24%) patients; the most common was neutropenia in three (8%) patients. There have been no deaths on study. INTERPRETATION: Acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab is a highly active and well tolerated frontline therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although the primary endpoint of this study was not met, the high proportion of patients who had undetectable MRD in the bone marrow supports further investigation of this regimen, which is being tested against acalabrutinib-venetoclax and chemoimmunotherapy in an ongoing phase 3 study (NCT03836261).

We identified nuclear alphavbeta3 pool in ovarian cancer cells and were interested to explore this phenomenon in two rare and aggressive types of leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and Mast cell leukemia (MCL) using Jurkat and HMC-1 cell lines, respectively. Moreover, we collected primary cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n = 11), the most common chronic adult leukemia and used human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) generated from normal B cells. Nuclear alphavbeta3 integrin was assessed by Western blots, confocal microscopy, and the ImageStream technology which combines flow-cytometry with microscopy. We further examined post translational modifications (phosphorylation/glycosylation), nuclear trafficking regulation using inhibitors for MAPK (U0126) and PI3K (LY294002), as well as nuclear interactions by performing Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). alphavbeta3 integrin was identified in all cell models within the nucleus and is N-glycosylated. In primary CLL cells the beta3 integrin monomer is tyrosine Y759 phosphorylated, suggesting an active receptor conformation. MAPK and PI3K inhibition in Jurkat and CLL cells led to alphavbeta3 enhancement in the nucleus and a reduction in the membrane. The nuclear alphavbeta3 integrin interacts with ERK, Histone H3 and Lamin B1 in Jurkat, Histone H3 in CLL cells, but not in control LCL cells. To conclude, this observational study provides the identification of nuclear alphavbeta3 in hematological malignancies and lays the basis for novel cancer-relevant actions, which may be independent from the membrane functions.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Weisz, Avivit', 'Abadi, Uri', 'Mausbach, Lisa', 'Gurwitz, David', 'Ellis, Martin', 'Ashur-Fabian, Osnat']","['Weisz A', 'Abadi U', 'Mausbach L', 'Gurwitz D', 'Ellis M', 'Ashur-Fabian O']","['Translational Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Translational Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Translational Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Translational Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Translational Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210917,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'chronic leukemia', 'hematology', 'integrin', 'malignancy']",2021/09/18 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2021/09/17 17:30'],"['2021/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/17 17:30 [entrez]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2927 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Sep 17. doi: 10.1002/hon.2927.,,,,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8624-3182'],['Varda and Boaz Dotan Research Center in Hemato-Oncology'],,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its role as a therapeutic target in several haematological malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, BTK has been gaining tremendous momentum in recent years. Within the immune system, BTK plays a part in numerous pathways and cells beyond B cells (i.e. T cells, macrophages). Not surprisingly, BTK has been elucidated to be a driving factor not only in lymphoproliferative disorders but also in autoimmune diseases and response to infection. To extort this role, BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib have been developed to target BTK in other diseases. However, due to rising levels of resistance, the urgency to develop new inhibitors with alternative modes of targeting BTK is high. To meet this demand, an expanding list of BTK inhibitors is currently being trialled. In this review, we synopsize recent discoveries regarding BTK and its role within different immune cells and pathways. Additionally, we discuss the broad significance and relevance of BTK for various diseases ranging from haematology and rheumatology to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, BTK signalling and its targetable nature have emerged as immensely important for a wide range of clinical applications. The development of novel, more specific and less toxic BTK inhibitors could be revolutionary for a significant number of diseases with yet unmet treatment needs.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['McDonald, Charlotte', 'Xanthopoulos, Charalampos', 'Kostareli, Efterpi']","['McDonald C', 'Xanthopoulos C', 'Kostareli E']","[""The Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK."", ""The Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK."", ""The Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20211004,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*BTK inhibitor', ""*Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", '*autoimmunity', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*ibrutinib', '*infections', '*lymphoproliferative disorders']",2021/09/18 06:00,2021/11/12 06:00,['2021/09/17 17:29'],"['2021/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/17 17:29 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imm.13416 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2021 Dec;164(4):722-736. doi: 10.1111/imm.13416.

METHODS: We utilized the expanded-Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system, including 27 counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin, to identify patients with IBM, other inflammatory myopathies (IIM), and age/sex-matched population-controls. We compared the frequency of various comorbidities and survival among groups. RESUTLS: We identified 50 IBM patients, 65 IIM-controls, and 294 population-controls. Dysphagia was most common in IBM (64%) patients. The frequency of neurodegenerative disorders (dementia/Parkinsonism) and solid cancers was not different between groups. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most common rheumatic disease in all groups. 36% of IBM patients had a peripheral neuropathy, 6% had Sjogren's syndrome, and 10% had a hematologic malignancy. T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia was only observed in the IBM group. None of the IBM patients had hepatitis B or C, or HIV. IBM patients were 2.7-times more likely to have peripheral neuropathy, 6.2-times more likely to have Sjogren's syndrome, and 3.9-times more likely to have a hematologic malignancy than population-controls. IBM was associated with increased mortality, with a 10-year survival of 36% from index, compared to 67% in IIM and 59% in population-controls. Respiratory failure or pneumonia (44%) was the most common cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: IBM is associated with lower survival, and higher frequency of peripheral neuropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and hematologic malignancies than the general population. Close monitoring of IBM-related complications is warranted.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the', 'British Society for Rheumatology. All rights reserved.

Traditionally, HNCC has been related to tobacco and alcohol exposure; however, over the past decade, a growing number of head and neck cancers are attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzaD) was demonstrated as an effective chemotherapeutic agent for acute myelogenous leukaemia. Preclinical data revealed that 5-aza inhibits growth and increases cell death of HPV(+) cancer cells. These effects are associated with reduced expression of HPV genes, stabilization of TP53, and activation of TP53-dependent apoptosis. The aim of the present study is to test the effect of 5-AzaD on growth of human squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu), a HPV(-) and p53 mutated cells, in vitro and in vivo. The effect of 5-AzaD on cell viability, cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis was tested in vitro. The effect of 5-AzaD on tumour growth in vivo was tested using xenograft mice inoculated with FaDu cells. The results indicated that 5-AzaD reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in FaDu cells in vitro. In vivo studies revealed that 5-AzaD suppresses the growth of tumours in xenograft mice inoculated with FaDu cells through inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. These findings may emphasis that 5-AzaD is effective in treatment of HPV(-) HNSCC tumours through TP53 independent pathway.

By upregulating glycolysis, cancer cells acquire a proliferative advantage over normal hematopoietic cells; in addition, these changes in energy metabolism contribute to anticancer drug resistance. Because leukemia cells proliferate by consuming glucose as an energy source, an alternative nutrient source is essential when glucose levels in bone marrow are insufficient. We profiled sugar metabolism in leukemia cells and found that mannose is an energy source for glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Leukemia cells express high levels of phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), which mobilizes mannose to glycolysis; consequently, even mannose in the blood can be used as an energy source for glycolysis. Conversely, suppression of PMI expression or a mannose load exceeding the processing capacity of PMI inhibited transcription of genes related to mitochondrial metabolism and the TCA cycle, therefore suppressing the growth of leukemia cells. High PMI expression was also a poor prognostic factor for acute myeloid leukemia. Our findings reveal a new mechanism for glucose starvation resistance in leukemia. Furthermore, the combination of PMI suppression and mannose loading has potential as a novel treatment for driver oncogene-independent leukemia.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

DIAGNOSIS: Hypereosinophilia (HE) has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1.5 x 10(9) /L. After exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, next generation sequencing gene assays, and flow immunophenotyping to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic hematolymphoid neoplasm. RISK STRATIFICATION: Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2016 World Health Organization endorses a semi-molecular classification scheme of disease subtypes. This includes the major category ""myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 or with PCM1-JAK2"", and the myeloproliferative neoplasm subtype, ""chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified"" (CEL, NOS). Lymphocyte-variant HE is an aberrant T-cell clone-driven reactive eosinophila, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a diagnosis of exclusion. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (eg, < 1.5 x 10(9) /L) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant HE and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and in steroid-refractory cases of HES. Mepolizumab, an interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonist monoclonal antibody, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with idiopathic HES.

A systematic review.,546-562,10.1111/1440-1630.12750 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Advances in cancer treatment over the last decade have led to increased survival rates. As a result, survivors are living longer with and beyond cancer, often with greater levels of morbidity. Occupational therapists, with their focus on remedial and compensatory strategies to improve function and participation, are well suited to assess and intervene with this population. Despite this, little research exists to demonstrate the efficacy of interventions and value of the occupational therapy role. This systematic review aimed to review how and when occupational therapists provide services for adult patients with cancer and identify where they add the most value. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of six electronic databases. Eligible studies reported on occupational therapy interventions targeting management of cancer symptoms, rehabilitation or environmental modifications for adult cancer patients discharged from acute hospital services. Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by two reviewers. Narrative synthesis summarised the attributes and treatment outcomes of each intervention. RESULTS: Nine articles were included from a total of 309 articles retrieved. Eight different interventions were reported for people with cancer (n = 531). Small sample sizes and methodological quality precluded any formal analysis; however, intervention components that showed positive results were person-centred, individualised and included regular monitoring and flexibility in care, with input from multidisciplinary health professionals. Therapists also need to reflect upon the optimal duration of interventions and selection of outcome measures that specifically match intervention components. CONCLUSION: Despite inconclusive support of any particular type of intervention, this systematic review identified several successful intervention components for occupational therapists working with people with or beyond cancer. Overall, findings suggest that monitored tailored programmes compensating for fluctuations in a patient's condition have efficacy to improve patient outcomes and should be considered when delivering intervention with patients post hospital discharge.",['(c) 2021 Occupational Therapy Australia.'],"['Taylor, Susan', 'Keesing, Sharon', 'Wallis, Amy', 'Russell, Brooke', 'Smith, Andrew', 'Grant, Rebecca']","['Taylor S', 'Keesing S', 'Wallis A', 'Russell B', 'Smith A', 'Grant R']","['School of Allied Health, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', ""Occupational Therapy Department, Perth Children's Hospital, Child and Adolescent Health Service, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."", 'Occupational Therapy Department, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, North Metropolitan Health Service, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Allied Health, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Occupational Therapy, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Occupational Therapy Department, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, North Metropolitan Health Service, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Leukaemia Foundation, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Occupational Therapy Department, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, North Metropolitan Health Service, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20210917,Australia,Aust Occup Ther J,Australian occupational therapy journal,15420200R,IM,,,2021/09/18 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/09/17 08:46'],"['2021/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/17 08:46 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1440-1630.12750 [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Occup Ther J. 2021 Dec;68(6):546-562. doi: 10.1111/1440-1630.12750.

However, little is known about cytogenetics at the time of relapse. METHODS: This international study analyzed the prognostic value of cytogenetic profiles and karyotypic changes in pediatric relapsed AML in relation to the probability of event-free (pEFS) and overall survival (pOS). For this purpose, cytogenetic reports from all patients registered on the Relapsed AML 2001/01 Study were reviewed and classified. RESULTS: Cytogenetic information at relapse was available for 403 (71%) of 569 registered patients. Frequently detected aberrations at relapse were t(8;21)(q22;q22) (n = 60) and inv(16)(p13.1q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) (n = 24), both associated with relatively good outcome (4-year pOS 59% and 71%, respectively). Monosomy 7/7q-, t(9;11)(p22;q23), t(10;11)(p12;q23), and complex karyotypes were associated with poor outcomes (4-year pOS 17%, 19%, 22%, and 22%, respectively). Of 261 (65%) patients for whom cytogenetic data were reliable at both diagnosis and relapse, pEFS was inferior for patients with karyotypic instability (n = 128, 49%), but pOS was similar. Unstable karyotypes with both gain and loss of aberrations were associated with inferior outcome. Early treatment response, time to relapse, and cytogenetic profile at time of relapse were the most important prognostic factors, both outweighing karytoypic instability per se. CONCLUSION: The cytogenetic subgroup at relapse is an independent risk factor for (event-free) survival. Cytogenetic assessment at the time of relapse is of high importance and may contribute to improved risk-adapted treatment for children with relapsed AML.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Klein, Kim', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'von Neuhoff, Christine', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'van Weelderen, Romy', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Fynn, Alcira', 'Gibson, Brenda', 'Ha, Shau-Yin', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Elitzur, Sarah', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Maschan, Alexei', 'Razzouk, Bassem', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Smisek, Pter', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Klein K', 'Beverloo HB', 'Zimmermann M', 'Raimondi SC', 'von Neuhoff C', 'de Haas V', 'van Weelderen R', 'Cloos J', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Bertrand Y', 'Dworzak M', 'Fynn A', 'Gibson B', 'Ha SY', 'Harrison CJ', 'Hasle H', 'Elitzur S', 'Leverger G', 'Maschan A', 'Razzouk B', 'Reinhardt D', 'Rizzari C', 'Smisek P', 'Creutzig U', 'Kaspers GJL']","[""Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Clinical laboratory, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."", ""Children's Leukemia Cooperative Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Institut d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie Pediatrique, Lyon, France."", ""St. Anna Children's Hospital and Children's Cancer Research Institute, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Grupo Argentino de Tratamiento de la Leucemia Aguda, Children's Hospital La Plata, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina."", 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, United Kingdom Childhood Leukaemia Study Group, Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, UK.', ""Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric oncology, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, Hong Kong, China."", 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', ""Schneider Children's Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel."", 'Hematopathology Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Oncology and Immunology, Dmitriy Rogachev Federal Center for Pediatric Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Peyton Manning Children's Hospital at St. Vincent, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca, S.

METHODS: For exposure-efficacy analyses, patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were assessed for best overall response, progression-free survival and tumour regression. For exposure-safety analyses, incidences of grade >/=2 adverse events (AEs), grade >/=3 AEs and grade >/=2 events of clinical interest were assessed in patients with B-cell malignancies. Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates were obtained from population PK modelling. Exposure calculations were based on study dosing regimens. Total active moieties were calculated to account for contributions of ACP-5862 to overall efficacy/safety. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients were included (exposure-efficacy analyses, n = 274; exposure-safety analyses, n = 573). Most patients (93%) received acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily. Median total active area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24h,ss ) and total active maximal concentration at steady-state (Cmax,ss ) were similar for patients who received acalabrutinib as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab, and for responders and nonresponders. No relationship was observed between AUC24h,ss /Cmax,ss and progression-free survival or tumour regression. Acalabrutinib AUC24h,ss and Cmax,ss were generally comparable across groups regardless of AE incidence. CONCLUSION: No clinically meaningful correlations between acalabrutinib PK exposure and efficacy and safety outcomes were observed. These data support the fixed acalabrutinib dose of 100 mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Nevertheless, little is known about the biological function of circ_0000376 in the progression of osteosarcoma (OS). Cell viability, colony formation ability, apoptosis, and motility were analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and transwell assays. Cellular glycolytic metabolism was analyzed using commercial kits. RT-qPCR and Western blot assay were performed to analyze RNA and protein expression in OS tissues and cells. Starbase software was used to establish circRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA linkage, and intermolecular interaction was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Xenograft tumor assay was conducted to analyze the effects of Tanshinone I (Tan I) and circ_0000376 on xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Tan I treatment suppressed the viability, migration, invasion, and glycolysis and triggered the apoptosis of OS cells. Tan I treatment markedly down-regulated circ_0000376 expression in OS cells. The addition of circ_0000376 plasmid largely rescued the malignant behaviors of OS cells upon Tan I exposure. Circ_0000376 interacted with miR-432-5p in OS cells. Circ_0000376 overexpression-mediated protective effects in Tan I-induced OS cells were partly attenuated by the accumulation of miR-432-5p. miR-432-5p bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) in OS cells. miR-432-5p interference-induced effects in Tan I-treated OS cells were partly overturned by the silence of BCL2. Circ_0000376 can act as miR-432-5p sponge to up-regulate BCL2 expression in OS cells. Circ_0000376 silencing contributed to the anti-tumor effect of Tan I on the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. Tan I exerted an anti-tumor role in OS progression by targeting circ_0000376/miR-432-5p/BCL2 axis.","['(c) 2021.

It is part of chemotherapy in the treatment of leukemia in the last three decades. L-Asparaginase is isolated from Fusarium sp. isolated from soil and purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sephadex G 100. Characterization of the crude enzyme revealed it is a metalloprotease inhibited by EDTA. Hg(2+), Cd(2+), and Pb(2+) also inhibited the enzyme. Mg(2+), Zn(2+), and Ca(2+) activated L-asparaginase. Furthermore, kinetic studies of purified enzyme were carried out. Vmax and Km were 0.031 M and 454 U/mL, respectively. The optimum temperature was 30 degrees C and the optimum pH was 7. Concerning substrate specificity, gelatin and casein in addition to L-asparagine were tested. The enzyme was found to be nonspecific that could hydrolyze all tested substrates at different rates. The maximum enzyme activity was recorded in the case of L-asparagine, followed by casein and gelatin, respectively. The molecular weight of L-asparaginase was 22.5 kDa. The antileukemic cytotoxicity assay of the enzyme against RAW2674 leukemic cell lines by MTT viability test was estimated. The enzyme exhibited antileukemic activity with IC50 of 50.1 UmL(-1). The current work presents additional information regarding the purification and characterization of the enzyme produced by Fusarium sp. and its evaluation as a potential antileukemic chemotherapeutic agent.","['(c) 2021.

In this effort we pursue the synthesis and in vitro anticancer, antibacterial and antioxidant properties of some novel benzopyrylium salts. The benzopyrylium salts were synthesized and further characterized via UV-vis, IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and mass spectrometry. The benzopyrylium salts were tested in vitro for anticancer activity across NCI 60 cell line panel. PS-CP-4MO showed the best activity against the MDA-MB-435 cell line of melanoma cancer in terms of the least GI50 (1.78 muM), TGI (3.47 muM) and LC50 (6.77 muM) values and showed selectivity against melanoma, colon cancer and leukemia. Mechanistic studies indicate that this compound inhibits MCF-7 cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and abrogates colony formation and wound healing in the cancer cells. Antibacterial studies show that some of the benzopyrylium salts are active on S. aureus (ATCC 29213) and the best active compound PS-CP-5Cl has a MIC of 8 mug/mL.

Large-scale sequencing of patient-derived cancer samples has identified several druggable driver oncogenes. Many of these oncogenes can be pharmacologically targeted to provide effective therapies for breast cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, and other cancer types. Initial responses to these agents can be robust in many cancer types and some patients with cancer experience sustained tumor inhibition. However, resistance to these targeted therapeutics frequently emerges, either from intrinsic or acquired mechanisms, posing a major clinical hurdle for effective treatment. Several resistance mechanisms, both cell autonomous and cell nonautonomous, have been identified in different cancer types.

We have established a CRISPR screening approach using orthotopic xenograft models to validate and prioritize AML-enriched dependencies in vivo, including in CRISPR-competent AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models tractable for genome editing. Our integrated pipeline has revealed several targets with translational value, including SLC5A3 as a metabolic vulnerability for AML addicted to exogenous myo-inositol and MARCH5 as a critical guardian to prevent apoptosis in AML.

Initial experiences with CD19 CAR T cell immunotherapy for patients with B-cell malignancies highlighted the critical impact of intracellular costimulatory domain selection (CD28 vs 4-1BB (CD137)) on CAR T cell expansion and in vivo persistence that may impact clinical outcomes. However, the impact of costimulatory domains on the efficacy of myeloid antigen-directed CAR T cell immunotherapy remains unknown. METHODS: In this preclinical study, we developed six CAR constructs targeting CD33, a highly expressed and validated AML target, comprised of one of three single-chain variable fragments with CD3zeta and either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains. We systematically compared the preclinical in vitro and in vivo efficacy of T cells lentivirally transduced with CD33 CAR constructs (CD33CARTs) against human AML. RESULTS: We observed potent in vitro cytokine production and cytotoxicity of CD33CARTs incubated with human CD33+ AML cell lines, as well as robust in vivo antileukemia activity in cell line and childhood AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Gemtuzumab-based CD33CARTs were unexpectedly toxic in vivo in animal models despite observed in vitro anti-leukemia activity. CD28-based CD33CARTs consistently induced more robust inhibition of leukemia proliferation in AML cell line and PDX models than did 4-1BB-based CD33CARTs. A 'best-in-class' lintuzumab-CD28/CD3zeta CAR construct was thus selected for clinical translation. CONCLUSIONS: CD33 is a critical antigen for potential immunotherapeutic targeting in patients with AML. Based on this rigorous preclinical evaluation, our validated clinical grade lintuzumab-CD28/CD3zeta CD33CART immunotherapy is now under evaluation in a first-in-child/first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial for children and adolescents/young adults with relapsed/refractory AML.

It is usually defined by three sequential stages (Chronic, Accelerated and Blast-crisis) where the transition from chronic to accelerated to blast phases is presumed to occur due to secondary genetic changes, viz. accumulation of mutations, activation of downstream pathways and failure of apoptosis. Caspase 9 is the initiator caspase involved in mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. Polymorphisms in the promoter (-1263 A>G, -712C>T, -293 del) and coding (Ex5 +32G>A) regions of CASP9 gene are found to influence the expression levels by either impairing the activation or loss of expression of CASP9 or insufficient formation of apoptosome. METHODS: The present case-control study was carried out on 999 individuals, comprised of 485CML cases reported at Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Hyderabad and 514 age and gender-matched healthy individuals from local population. DNA was isolated by non-enzymatic/salting-out method and was genotyped using RFLP technique. RESULTS: It was observed that the presence of G allele of CASP9 -1263A>G polymorphism enhanced the risk for CML while CASP9 -712C>T and CASP9 -293del SNPs conferred protection against development of CML. Haplotype analysis of promoter and exonic polymorphisms had revealed increased risk associated with two haplotypes G_C_del (+)_G (OR-1.61, 95% CI-0.97-2.65, p-0.06#) and G_C_del (-)_G (OR-2.09, 95% CI-0.94-4.66, p-0.07#) suggesting the role of G allele of CASP9 -1263A>G in conferring risk independent of other SNPs. Pairwise LD analysis performed for all the four SNPs revealed the presence of LD among the SNPs. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study therefore concludes the role of CASP9 -1263A>G polymorphism in increasing the risk for the development and progression while CASP9 -712C>T and CASP9 -293del SNPs conferred protection and CASP9 Ex5 +32G>A was involved in conferring resistance which could be in combination with other SNPs or factors affecting them.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

However, approximately 50% of patients do not respond to this therapy. To improve the clinical outcome of these patients, it is necessary to develop strategies with other optimal targets to enable secondary or combinational CAR-T cell therapy. By screening a panel of surface antigens, we found that CD32b (FcgammaRIIb) was homogeneously expressed at high site density on tumor cells from CLL patients. We then developed a second-generation CAR construct targeting CD32b, and T cells transduced with the CD32 CAR efficiently eliminated the CD32b(+) Raji leukemic cell line in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, CD32b CAR-T cells showed cytotoxicity against primary human CLL cells that were cultured in vitro or transplanted into immunodeficient mice. The efficacy of CD32b CAR T cells correlated with the CD32b density on CLL cells. CD32b is not significantly expressed by non-B hematopoietic cells. Our study thus identifies CD32b as a potential target of CAR-T cell therapy for CLL, although further modification of the CAR construct with a safety mechanism may be required to minimize off-target toxicity.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: Data of 99 patients with newly diagnosed ALL, who were treated with the KALLA 1406/1407 protocol, were retrospectively analyzed. All patients equally received age-adjusted daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone. L-asparaginase was additionally administered to Philadelphia (Ph)-negative patients according to age, whereas Ph-positive patients received 600 mg/day of imatinib. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 62 (62.6%) were diagnosed with Ph-negative ALL and 37 (37.3%) were diagnosed with Ph-positive ALL. The median age of patients in the Ph-negative ALL group was 46 years, and that of patients in the Ph-positive ALL group was 49 years. In patients with Ph-negative ALL, 57 (92%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 2 years were estimated to be 42% and 63%, respectively. In patients with Ph-positive ALL, 32 (86%) patients achieved CR/CRi, and 2-year DFS and OS were 31.2% and 49.1%, respectively. Patients who were able to proceed to the allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and younger patients showed significantly superior survival in both Ph-negative ALL and Ph-positive ALL. Neutropenic fever and bacterial infection were the most common and severe adverse events. CONCLUSION: The KALLA 1406/1407 protocol showed tolerable toxicities in adult ALL patients.

Rituximab-abbs (first biosimilar approved in 2017) is expected to significantly reduce healthcare economic burden due to lower acquisition costs. This non-interventional, non-comparative study assessed real-world effectiveness and tolerability of rituximab-abbs and rituximab in treatment-naive patients with CLL or NHL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Via an online physician survey, 46 UK-registered hematologists and oncologists retrospectively reported on randomly selected patients aged >/=18 years with CLL or NHL with rituximab-abbs or rituximab as first-line immunotherapy. Overall, 201 patient charts were examined across 4 cohorts: rituximab-abbs in CLL, rituximab-abbs in NHL, rituximab in CLL, rituximab in NHL. RESULTS: Demographic profiles across cohorts were similar. Most patients (94 %-100 %) received combination therapy (rituximab-abbs or rituximab mainly with chemotherapy). For both treatments, overall response rate (94 %-98 %) and 1-year overall survival (98 %-100 %) were very high for patients with CLL or NHL. Most common serious adverse events were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia and infusion reactions. The majority of patients (54 %-66 %) did not experience a grade >/=3 adverse event. Healthcare resource utilization was similarly high across cohorts, driven by diagnostic testing, oncologist office visits, and day-case hospital admissions; many patients required supportive medical therapies. Mean annual savings of approximately pound1000/patient driven by acquisition costs occurred with rituximab-abbs versus rituximab, administration costs were similar. CONCLUSION: Rituximab-abbs and rituximab demonstrated similar effectiveness and tolerability in treating CLL and NHL in routine UK clinical practice and demonstrate the utility of the biosimilar as a cost-saving alternative treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant reductions in the molecular burden of disease were seen with the first generation TKI imatinib and with the addition of dasatinib (2006), nilotinib (2007), bosutinib (2012) and ponatinib (2013), deeper and more rapid reductions were noted. Physicians could begin to tailor TKI therapy to individual patients, and patients who did not respond to or could not tolerate first line therapy now had options. Importantly, the number of patients who developed accelerated or blast phase disease decreased dramatically. Research in CML continues to evolve and by presenting illustrative cases, this article will review some of the newer aspects of clinical care in this disease. Updated information regarding bosutinib and asciminib, the latter currently in clinical trials, will be presented; bosutinib is of particular interest as the drug's transit through the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) highlights the question of what is considered optimal response to TKI therapy. The challenge of understanding the cardiac safety data of ponatinib and the unique dosing schedule based on individual response will be discussed. Lastly, two cases will focus on features of TKI treatment that -remarkably- have become part of the treatment algorithm: family planning for women with CML and stopping therapy after meeting a specific treatment milestone.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Berman, Ellin']",['Berman E'],"['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210916,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/09/17 06:00,2021/09/17 06:00,['2021/09/16 17:26'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/16 17:26 [entrez]', '2021/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01611-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011722 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Sep 16. pii: S0006-4971(21)01611-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011722.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients previously enrolled in the randomized controlled trial APL0406 were considered eligible for this follow-up study. The following patient-reported outcome measures were used: the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20 (QLQ-CIPN20), and the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36). The prevalence of late comorbidities and health problems was also assessed. The clinical significance of differences was evaluated based on predefined thresholds. A total of 161 of 232 potentially eligible patients were analyzed, of whom 83 were treated with ATRA-ATO and 78 were treated with ATRA chemotherapy. The median time since diagnosis of the study sample was 8 years. The 2 largest clinically meaningful differences in the EORTC QLQ-C30 were observed for role functioning (Delta = 8.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 16.3) and dyspnea (Delta = -8.5; 95% CI, -16.4 to -0.7), favoring patients treated with ATRA-ATO. With regard to the SF-36 results, a clinically relevant better physical component score (Delta = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 7.8) was observed in patients treated with ATRA-ATO, but this was not the case for the mental component score. The 2 groups showed similar profiles in the scores of the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 scales and in the prevalence of late comorbidities. Overall, our findings suggest that the greater and more sustained antileukemic efficacy of ATRA-ATO is also associated with better long-term patient-reported outcomes than ATRA chemotherapy.

The enzyme is activated by binding to DNA single-strand and double-strand breaks. Its contribution to chromatin remodeling makes PARP1 crucial for gene expression regulation. Inhibition of its activity with small molecules leads to the synthetic lethal effect by impeding DNA repair in the treatment of cancer cells. At first, PARP1 inhibitors (PARPis) were developed to target breast cancer mutated cancer cells. Currently, PARPis are being studied to be used in a broader variety of patients either as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy, antiangiogenic agents, ionizing radiation, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Ongoing clinical trials on olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and the recent talazoparib show the advantage of these agents in overcoming PARPi resistance and underline their efficacy in targeted treatment of several hematologic malignancies. In this review, focusing on the crucial role of PARP1 in physiological and pathological effects in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, we give an outline of the enzyme's mechanisms of action and its role in the pathophysiology and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia and we analyze the available data on the use of PARPis, highlighting their promising advances in clinical application.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

These canonical fusions (ZNF384r) contain the complete ZNF384 coding sequence and are associated with a specific gene expression signature. Cases with this signature, but without canonical ZNF384 fusions (ZNF384r-like cases), have been described previously. Although some have been shown to harbor ZNF362 fusions, the primary aberrations remain unknown in a major proportion. We studied 3 patients with the ZNF384r signature and unknown primary genetic background and identified a previously unknown class of genetic aberration affecting the last exon of ZNF384 and resulting in disruption of the C-terminal portion of the ZNF384 protein. Importantly, in 2 cases, the ZNF384 aberration, indel, was missed during the bioinformatic analysis but revealed by the manual, targeted reanalysis. Two cases with the novel aberrations had a mixed (B/myeloid) immunophenotype commonly associated with canonical ZNF384 fusions. In conclusion, we present leukemia cases with a novel class of ZNF384 aberrations that phenocopy leukemia with ZNF384r. Therefore, we show that part of the so-called ZNF384r-like cases represent the same genetic subtype as leukemia with canonical ZNF384 fusions.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Here, we describe a pipeline, ISOTOPE (ISOform-guided prediction of epiTOPEs In Cancer), for the comprehensive identification of tumor-specific splicing-derived epitopes. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry for MHC-I associated proteins, ISOTOPE identified neoepitopes from tumor-specific splicing events that are potentially presented by MHC-I complexes. Analysis of multiple samples indicates that splicing alterations may affect the production of self-epitopes and generate more candidate neoepitopes than somatic mutations. Although there was no difference in the number of splicing-derived neoepitopes between responders and non-responders to immune therapy, higher MHC-I binding affinity was associated with a positive response. Our analyses highlight the diversity of the immunogenic impacts of tumor-specific splicing alterations and the importance of studying splicing alterations to fully characterize tumors in the context of immunotherapies.

However, choosing an appropriate PRO measure from the many available remains challenging for clinicians and researchers. One of the common pitfalls in instrument selection is that the instrument is often developed with a different patient population than the group being cared for or researched. This difference can result in salient items of importance to the patients, being under-reported or missed altogether.

Diagnostic and therapeutic standards are less well-established in comparison to other leukemic conditions and standards of care are lacking. Morphologic and molecular similarities to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are hard to distinguish. We here report a BPDCN patient with a long, challenging diagnostic period. While bone marrow biopsies initially failed to prove the correct diagnosis, a cutaneous biopsy finally identified a CD45(+)/CD56(+)/CD4(+)/CD123(+)/CD33(+)/MPO(-) population suggestive of BPDCN which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Molecular analysis revealed an ASXL-1, TET2 and SRSF2-mutation, cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype. Treatment with the recently approved CD123-cytotoxin Tagraxofusp showed initially a very good response. This case reflects diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties in BPDCN as very rare, easily misdiagnosed neoplasia and the need for precise diagnostic care.",['(c) 2021.

Since then, PBX1 has been associated with important developmental programs, and its expression dysregulation has been related to multifactorial disorders, including cancer. As PBX1 overexpression in many cancers is correlated to poor prognosis, we sought to understand how this transcription factor contributes to carcinogenesis, and to organize PBX1's roles in the hallmarks of cancer. There is enough evidence to associate PBX1 with at least five hallmarks: sustaining proliferative signaling, activating invasion and metastasis, inducing angiogenesis, resisting cell death, and deregulating cellular energetics. The lack of studies investigating a possible role for PBX1 on the remaining hallmarks made it impossible to defend or refute its contribution on them. However, the functions of some of the PBX1's transcription targets indicate a potential engagement of PBX1 in the avoidance of immune destruction and in the tumor-promoting inflammation hallmarks. Interestingly, PBX1 might be a player in tumor suppression by activating the transcription of some DNA damage response genes. This is the first review organizing PBX1 roles into the hallmarks of cancer. Thus, we encourage future studies to uncover the PBX1's underlying mechanisms to promote carcinogenesis, for it is a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, as well as a potential target in cancer treatment.","['(c) 2021.

However, a method for the rapid and convenient detection of exosomes is still a challenge because current analysis processes involve multiple steps and yield low sensitivity. Here, we developed a wash-free fluorescent biosensor for the rapid and sensitive quantification of exosomes by combining aptamer and nicking endonuclease (Nb.BbvCI). In this system, an aptamer-trigger complex was used as the recognition element; the trigger probe could be released, and it hybridized with gold nanoparticles (GNPs)-DNA-FAM conjugates, thereby resulting in Nb.BbvCI-assisted target recycling. As a result, our method allowed the quantification of exosomes with lower analysis time by using a cocktail containing an aptamer-trigger complex, Nb.BbvCI, and GNPs-DNA-FAM. A high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.0 x 10(4) particles per muL could be achieved. Besides, this biosensor exhibited potential application for the quantification of exosomes in human plasma, facilitating the development of exosome-based noninvasive cancer diagnosis.",,"['Zhou, Mengyang', 'Li, Chao', 'Wang, Baolong', 'Huang, Lin']","['Zhou M', 'Li C', 'Wang B', 'Huang L']","['School of Life Sciences, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230032, China. huanglin8904@163.com.', 'School of Life Sciences, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230032, China. huanglin8904@163.com.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui 230001, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230032, China. huanglin8904@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210916,England,Anal Methods,Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,101519733,IM,,,2021/09/17 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/09/16 12:19'],"['2021/09/16 12:19 [entrez]', '2021/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/d1ay00854d [doi]'],epublish,Anal Methods. 2021 Sep 16;13(35):4001-4007. doi: 10.1039/d1ay00854d.,20211028,"['7440-57-5 (Gold)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']","['Endonucleases', '*Exosomes', 'Gold', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Metal Nanoparticles']",35,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8794-7920'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities on extramedullary tissues involved by CLL/SLL and evaluated their association with prominent proliferation centers (PPCs). METHODS: FISH for recurrent abnormalities in CLL/SLL was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy sections. PPCs were identified on H&E-stained sections. Available FISH results on peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens were also reviewed. RESULTS: Recurrent FISH abnormalities were detected in 69% of 320 CLL/SLL biopsy specimens studied, including +12 (35%), 13q- (24%), 11q- (15%), 17p- (6%), 6q- (2%), and IGH/BCL2 (0.9%). Forty-three patients had abnormal blood or bone marrow FISH analyses, of whom 7 (16%) had discordant +12 and/or 13q-, and 3 (7%) had discordant 17p- or 11q-. Morphology was positive (17%), negative (78%), or equivocal (6%) for PPCs on 247 evaluable biopsy specimens, a finding not significantly associated with FISH results (P = .7). CONCLUSIONS: Trisomy 12 is overrepresented in tumoral CLL/SLL involvement, compared with the known predominance of 13q- in blood. Discrepancies between leukemic and tissue FISH findings are occasionally encountered. FISH results do not correlate with the presence of PPCs.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

METHODS: We identified 173 patients with ALL and LBL, including 12 cases of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia, 8 cases of therapy-related B-cell ALL (B-ALL), 119 cases of B-ALL, and 34 cases of T-cell ALL/LBL diagnosed from 2003 to 2019. We retrospectively assessed p53 and MYC expression by immunohistochemistry of bone marrow and correlated MYC expression with p53 expression and TP53 aberration. RESULTS: Expression of p53 and MYC was present in 11.5% and 27.7% of ALL/LBL cases (n = 20 and n = 48), respectively. MYC expression was significantly correlated with p53 expression and TP53 aberration (P = .002 and P = .03), and p53 expression and MYC expression had an adverse impact on OS in patients with ALL/LBL (P < .05).

The TP53 protein maintained the genomic integrity of the cell by regulating different pathways. The association of TP53 with leukemia and the increasing prevalence of leukemia in Pakistan instigated us to initiate the current study. Materials and Methods: The TP53 gene of acute myeloid leukemia patients (n = 23) and normal individuals (n = 30) was amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR amplified products of 3 samples 1 normal (NC-30) and 2 cancerous (LK-6 and LK-19) were subjected to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence analysis. Bioinformatics analysis of the obtained DNA sequences helped to identify nature, type, and functional impact of mutations, if any. Results: Results revealed 2 novel mutations in Case No. 1 (c. G >A10987 and c. InsA13298_13299) and Case No. 2 (c. InsC13284_13285, c. T >A13365) which generate a premature codon (ocher) at position 239 and lead to truncated TP53 protein. In Case No. 3, 16 novel mutations were identified and c. delC11093 mutation created a premature codon (opal) at 59(th) position. Hence, the resultant protein will lack its tetramerization and N-terminal domain required for its normal functioning. Moreover, some intronic mutations were noticed and found to have a negative impact on splicing related regulatory sequences.

Obese and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients are at high risk. Levocarnitine has been described as potentially beneficial for the treatment or prevention of PEG-ASP-associated hepatotoxicity. METHODS: We collected data for patients age >/=10 years who received levocarnitine during induction therapy for ALL, compared to a similar patient cohort who did not receive levocarnitine. The primary endpoint was conjugated bilirubin (c.bili) >3 mg/dl. Secondary endpoints were transaminases >10x the upper limit of normal and any Grade >/=3 hepatotoxicity. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients received levocarnitine for prophylaxis (n = 29) or rescue (n = 32) of hepatotoxicity. Compared to 109 patients without levocarnitine, more patients receiving levocarnitine were obese and/or older and had significantly higher values for some hepatotoxicity markers at diagnosis and after PEG-ASP. Levocarnitine regimens varied widely; no adverse effects of levocarnitine were identified. Obesity and AYA status were associated with an increased risk of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and severe transaminitis. Multivariable analysis identified a protective effect of levocarnitine on the development of c.bili >3 mg/dl (OR 0.12, p = 0.029). There was no difference between groups in CTCAE Grade >/=3 hepatotoxicity. C.bili >3 mg/dl during induction was associated with lower event-free survival.

In this prospective study, we evaluated the outcome of PLT transfusions in 40 patients with haematological malignancies, linking corrected count increment (CCI) to clot formation and agonist-induced platelet activation after transfusion. The CCI was highly variable between patients and 34% showed no response (1-h CCI < 7,5). Short time since the last PLT transfusion and extended storage time of the PLT product were linked to poor transfusion response, while patient sex, C-reactive protein or the number of chemotherapy cycles prior to transfusion did not influence transfusion outcome. High CCI and good PLT responsiveness to agonist stimulation predicted efficient clot formation in rotational thromboelastometry, but transfusion did not restore poor PLT function in patients to the level of healthy controls. Our study provides new insights into factors affecting PLT transfusion outcome in haematology patients with severe thrombocytopenia, and suggests that the thrombocytopenic environment, or disease-associated factors, may hamper platelet responsiveness.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

In this study, we found that canine NK cell-derived exosomes (NK-exosomes) separated from activated cytotoxic NK cell supernatants express specific markers including CD63, CD81, Alix, HSP70, TSG101, Perforin 1, and Granzyme B. We examined the antitumor effects of NK-exosomes in an experimental murine mammary tumor model using REM134 canine mammary carcinoma cell line. We observed changes in tumor size, tumor initiation, progression, and recurrence-related markers in the control, tumor group, and NK-exosome-treated tumor group. We found that the tumor size in the NK-exosome-treated tumor group decreased compared with that of the tumor group in the REM134-driven tumorigenic mouse model. We observed significant changes including the expression of tumorigenesis-related markers, such as B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metallopeptidase-3 (MMP-3), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), multidrug resistance protein (MDR), tumor suppressor protein p53 (p53), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and the apoptotic markers, B cell lymphoma-2 associated X (Bax) and B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) belonging to the Bcl-2 family, in the tumor group compared with those in the control group. The expression of CD133, a potent cancer stem cell marker, was significantly higher than that of the control. By contrast, the NK-exosome-treated tumor group exhibited a significant reduction in Bmi-1, MMP-3, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Bax, Bcl-xL, and PCNA expression compared with that in the tumor group. Furthermore, the expression of CD133, which mediates tumorigenesis, was significantly decreased in the NK-exosome-treated tumor group compared with that in the tumor group.

Accordingly, clinical testing (i.e., RT-PCR, NGS and IHC) for mutant NPM1 is increasing in order to detect residual disease in AML, alongside flow cytometry (FC). However, the relationship of the results from RT-PCR to traditional NGS, IHC and FC is not widely known among many practitioners. Herein, we aim to: i) describe the performance of RT-PCR compared to traditional NGS and IHC for the detection of mutant NPM1 in clinical practice, and also compare it to FC, and ii) provide our observations regarding the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in order to inform future clinical testing algorithms. Methods: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples collected for clinical testing at variable time points during patient management were tested by quantitative, real-time, RT-PCR and results were compared to findings from a Myeloid NGS panel, mutant NPM1 IHC and FC. Results: RT-PCR showed superior sensitivity compared to NGS, IHC and FC with the main challenge of NGS, IHC and FC being the ability to identify a low disease burden (<0.5% NCN by RT-PCR). Nevertheless, the positive predictive value of NGS, IHC and FC were each >/= 80% indicating that positive results by those assays are typically associated with RT-PCR positivity. IHC, unlike bulk methods (RT-PCR, NGS and FC), is able provide information regarding cellular/architectural context of disease in biopsies. FC did not identify any NPM1-mutated residual disease not already detected by RT-PCR, NGS or IHC. Conclusion: Overall, our findings demonstrate that RT-PCR shows superior sensitivity compared to a traditional Myeloid NGS, suggesting the need for ""deep-sequencing"" NGS panels for NGS-based monitoring of residual disease in NPM1-mutant AML. IHC provides complementary cytomorphologic information to RT-PCR. Lastly, FC may not be necessary in the setting of post-therapy follow up for NPM1-mutated AML. Together, these findings can help inform future clinical testing algorithms.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Lopez, Patel, Geyer, Racchumi, Chadburn, Simonson, Ouseph,', 'Inghirami, Mencia-Trinchant, Guzman, Gomez-Arteaga, Lee, Desai, Ritchie, Roboz,', 'Tam and Kluk.']","['Lopez, Amanda', 'Patel, Sanjay', 'Geyer, Julia T', 'Racchumi, Joelle', 'Chadburn, Amy', 'Simonson, Paul', 'Ouseph, Madhu M', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Mencia-Trinchant, Nuria', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Gomez-Arteaga, Alexandra', 'Lee, Sangmin', 'Desai, Pinkal', 'Ritchie, Ellen K', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Tam, Wayne', 'Kluk, Michael J']","['Lopez A', 'Patel S', 'Geyer JT', 'Racchumi J', 'Chadburn A', 'Simonson P', 'Ouseph MM', 'Inghirami G', 'Mencia-Trinchant N', 'Guzman ML', 'Gomez-Arteaga A', 'Lee S', 'Desai P', 'Ritchie EK', 'Roboz GJ', 'Tam W', 'Kluk MJ']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210830,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Flow Cytometry', 'IHC', 'MRD', 'NGS', 'NPM1', 'RT-PCR']",2021/09/17 06:00,2021/09/17 06:01,['2021/09/16 07:16'],"['2021/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/16 07:16 [entrez]', '2021/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.701318 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 30;11:701318. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.701318. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8435844,,,,,,,,,,

Patients affected by hematological neoplasms appear to be particularly at risk of developing COVID-19 complications, with unfavorable outcomes. Here, we present the case of a 57-years-old woman diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and concurrent acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At the time of diagnosis, it was decided to postpone leukemia therapy to enable adequate COVID-19 pneumonia treatment.

At the end of the first two cycles, the patient showed complete remission, and a post-remission consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been planned.

Methods: A retrospective case-control analysis was performed in a highly tuberculosis (TB)-endemic area. Patients with a history of TB before the diagnosis of lymphoma were retrospectively identified. Inpatients with lymphoma (n=1,057) and pathologically confirmed benign diseases (n=12,916) were consecutively enrolled at Xinjiang Medical University Cancer Hospital between January 2016 and December 2019. Results: The proportion of TB infection in patients with lymphoma (n=148, 14.0%) was significantly higher than that in the control (benign diseases) group (n=175, 1.4%) (p<0.0001). The frequencies of TB infection in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and T/NK-cell NHL were 13.6%, 14.6%, and 11.9%, respectively. Relatively high proportions of TB infection were found in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), at 20.6%, 18.6% and 15.3%, respectively, compared to other subtypes of B-cell NHL. For T/NK-cell NHL, the proportions of TB infection in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) were 18.2% and 20%, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that male sex was an adverse risk factor for lymphoma after tubercular infection. In addition, male sex and older age (>60 years) were associated with B-cell NHL. Conclusion: A high proportion of TB infection was found in patients with lymphoma. In TB-infected patients, older age and male sex were associated with susceptibility to lymphoma, suggesting that screening programmes might be useful for the early detection of lymphoma.

Nanotechnology solves the demerit by a guide in surgical resection of tumors, targeted chemotherapies, selective to cancerous cells, etc. This new technology can reduce the risk to the patient and automatically increased the probability of survival. Toward this goal, novel iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) coupled with leukemia anti-cancer drug were prepared and assessed. Methods: The IONPs were prepared by the co-precipitation method using Fe(+3)/Fe(+2)ratio of 2:1. These IONPs were used as a carrier for chlorambucil (Chloramb), where the IONPs serve as the cores and chitosan (CS) as a polymeric shell to form Chloramb-CS-IONPs. The products were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) analyses, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Results: The as-prepared IONPs were found to be magnetite (Fe3O4) and were coated by the CS polymer/Chloramb drug for the formation of the Chloramb-CS-IONPs. The average size for CS-IONPs and Chloramb-CS-IONPs nanocomposite was found to be 15 nm, with a drug loading of 19% for the letter. The release of the drug from the nanocomposite was found to be of a controlled-release manner with around 89.9% of the drug was released within about 5000 min and governed by the pseudo-second order. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies of CS-IONPs and Chloramb-CS-IONPs nanocomposite were tested on the normal fibroblast cell lines (3T3) and leukemia cancer cell lines (WEHI). Chloramb in Chloramb-CS-IONPs nanocomposite was found to be more efficient compared to its free form. Conclusion: This work shows that Chloramb-CS-IONPs nanocomposite is a promising candidate for magnetically targeted drug delivery for leukemia anti-cancer agents.",['(c) 2021 Hussein-Al-Ali et al.'],"['Hussein-Al-Ali, Samer Hasan', 'Hussein, Mohd Zobir', 'Bullo, Saifullah', 'Arulselvan, Palanisamy']","['Hussein-Al-Ali SH', 'Hussein MZ', 'Bullo S', 'Arulselvan P']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University, Amman, 11622, Jordan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Isra University, Amman, 11622, Jordan.', 'Materials Synthesis and Characterization Laboratory, Institute of Advanced Technology (ITMA), Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, 43400, Malaysia.', 'Materials Synthesis and Characterization Laboratory, Institute of Advanced Technology (ITMA), Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, 43400, Malaysia.', 'Laboratory of Vaccines and Immunotherapeutic, Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malyasia, Serdange, Selangor, 43400 UPM, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210908,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['anticancer', 'chlorambucil', 'leukemia cell lines', 'magnetic nanoparticles', 'sustained release']",2021/09/17 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/09/16 07:02'],"['2021/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/16 07:02 [entrez]', '2021/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S312752 [doi]', '312752 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2021 Sep 8;16:6205-6216. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S312752. eCollection 2021.,20211124,"['0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)']","['*Chitosan', 'Chlorambucil', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles', '*Magnetite Nanoparticles', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8760-6069', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0741-261X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1835-9738']",,PMC8435621,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, natural products have gained increasing attention in the field of anti-tumor due to their extensive sources and minimal side effects. Maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene acid mainly derived from the olive tree (Olea europaea L.) has been confirmed to possess great anti-cancer effects. This paper reviewed the inhibitory effect of MA and its derivatives on lung cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lymphatic, leukemia, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and bladder cancer, among others. MA inhibited the proliferation of various tumor cells and showed lower IC50 values in melanoma 518A2 cells and gastric cancer MKN28 cells compared with other cell lines. A series of semi-synthetic derivatives obtained by modifying MA chemical structure have been shown to have high cytotoxicity to human tumor cell lines, but low cytotoxicity to non-malignant cells, which is conducive to developing its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent. These studies suggest that MA derivatives have broad prospects in the development of antitumor therapeutics in the future and warrant further study.",['(c) 2021 Yu et al.'],"['Yu, Lei', 'Xie, Xiaofang', 'Cao, Xiaoyu', 'Chen, Junren', 'Chen, Guanru', 'Chen, Yan', 'Li, Gangmin', 'Qin, Junyuan', 'Peng, Fu', 'Peng, Cheng']","['Yu L', 'Xie X', 'Cao X', 'Chen J', 'Chen G', 'Chen Y', 'Li G', 'Qin J', 'Peng F', 'Peng C']","[""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Key Laboratory of Drug-Targeting and Drug Delivery System of the Education Ministry, Sichuan Engineering Laboratory for Plant-Sourced Drug and Sichuan Research Center for Drug Precision Industrial Technology, West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210909,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['derivatives', 'maslinic acid', 'mechanism', 'tumor']",2021/09/17 06:00,2021/09/17 06:00,['2021/09/16 07:02'],"['2021/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/16 07:02 [entrez]', '2021/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S326328 [doi]', '326328 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2021 Sep 9;15:3863-3879. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S326328. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest for this work.'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-6682-4710'],,PMC8437384,,,,,,,,,,

Both the number of transferred T cells and their differentiation state are critical determinants of effective responses(2,3). T cells can be expanded with T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation and interleukin-2, but this can lead to differentiation into effector T cells(4,5) and lower therapeutic efficacy(6), whereas maintenance of a more stem-cell-like state before adoptive transfer is beneficial(7). Here we show that H9T, an engineered interleukin-2 partial agonist, promotes the expansion of CD8(+) T cells without driving terminal differentiation. H9T led to altered STAT5 signalling and mediated distinctive downstream transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic programs. In addition, H9T treatment sustained the expression of T cell transcription factor 1 (TCF-1) and promoted mitochondrial fitness, thereby facilitating the maintenance of a stem-cell-like state. Moreover, TCR-transgenic and chimeric antigen receptor-modified CD8(+) T cells that were expanded with H9T showed robust anti-tumour activity in vivo in mouse models of melanoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Thus, engineering cytokine variants with distinctive properties is a promising strategy for creating new molecules with translational potential.","['(c) 2021.

Here, we demonstrate that congenital ALV-J infection induces the production of high-frequency and activated CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs that maintain persistent immunotolerance. A model of congenital infection by ALV-J was established in fertilized eggs, and hatched chicks showed persistent immunotolerance characterized by persistent viremia, immune organ dysplasia, severe imbalance of the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells in blood and immune organs, and significant decrease in CD3(+) T cells and Bu-1(+) B cells in the spleen. Concurrently, the mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-10, and IFN-gamma showed significant fluctuations in immune organs. Moreover, the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs in blood and immune organs significantly increased, and the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs was positively correlated with changes in ALV-J load in immune organs. Interestingly, CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs increased in the marginal zone of splenic nodules in ALV-J-infected chickens and dispersed to the germinal center. In addition, the proliferation and activation of B cells in splenic nodules was inhibited, and the number of IgM(+) and IgG(+) cells in the marginal zone significantly decreased. We further found that the mRNA levels of TGF- beta and CTLA-4 in CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs of ALV-J-infected chickens significantly increased. Together, high-frequency and activated CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs inhibited B cells functions by expressing the inhibitory cytokine TGF-beta and inhibitory surface receptor CTLA-4, thereby maintaining persistent immunotolerance in congenital ALV-J-infected chickens.",['(c) 2021.

There have been new developments since the initial publication. To integrate recent developments and further improve the consensus, a panel of experts from the CSH recently updated the consensus recommendations, which are summarized as follows: (1) there is a new algorithm for selecting appropriate donors for allo-HSCT candidates. Haploidentical donors (HIDs) are the preferred donor choice over matched sibling donors (MSDs) for patients with high-risk leukemia or elderly patients with young offspring donors in experienced centers. This replaces the previous algorithm for donor selection, which favored MSDs over HIDs. (2) Patients with refractory/relapsed lymphoblastic malignancies are now encouraged to undergo salvage treatment with novel immunotherapies prior to HSCT. (3) The consensus has been updated to reflect additional evidence for the application of allo-HSCT in specific groups of patients with hematological malignancies (intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), favorable-risk AML with positive minimal residual disease, and standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia). (4) The consensus has been updated to reflect additional evidence for the application of HSCT in patients with nonmalignant diseases, such as severe aplastic anemia and inherited diseases.

In this study, we characterized the mutation pattern of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducing protein 3 (TNFAIP3) and its role in the prognosis of TCL patients. METHODS: Coding sequence (CDS) mutations in TNFAIP3 in TCL patients was explored using exome-sequencing data from 79 patients in our center (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, GDPH) and 544 samples from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. Additionally, non-CDS mutations in TNFAIP3 in 41 TCL patients from our center (JNU) were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, non-CDS mutations in TNFAIP3 in 47 TCL patients from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset were explored. RESULTS: In the COSMIC database, TNFAIP3 mutations in TCL patients were located in the CDS, and the overall mutation frequency was 2.2%. However, TNFAIP3 mutations were not detected in the CDS of any of the samples in our center's datasets. Interestingly, non-CDS TNFAIP3 mutations were found in 14.6% and 4.3% of TCL patients in the JNU and GSE15842 dataset, respectively. Importantly, there was a clear trend showing that TCL patients with a TNFAIP3 mutation were associated with a longer 5-year restricted mean survival time (RMST) and favorable OS rate compared with those without a TNFAIP3 mutation in the JNU dataset [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 1.31, P = 0.089]. Furthermore, TNFAIP3 mutations significantly correlated with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) with a favorable prognosis in the JNU dataset (P = 0.002). Notably, the different mutation patterns of TNFAIP3 when comparing our center and the COSMIC datasets might be due to different ethnic and genetic backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time describe that TNFAIP3 mutations in non-CDS regions are associated with favorable OS for TCL patients, which might be a potential biomarker for the prognostic stratification of Chinese TCL patients.",['(c) 2021.

The treatment of ocular complications poses additional difficulties, because the eye is considered as a pharmacological ""sanctuary"" for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Therefore, radiotherapy is the main therapeutic choice; however, it might lead to many important side effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a bilateral leukemic optic nerve infiltration that remitted with chemotherapy without adjuvant radiotherapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old female patient with previous history of remitted ALL presented with a one-week history of floaters in her right eye. Her ophthalmological exam showed remarkable optic disc swelling, in both eyes. She was diagnosed with ALL relapse presenting as a bilateral optic nerve leukemic infiltration. Local radiotherapy was planned for both eyes, however, due to efficient recovery with chemotherapy, it was cancelled. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation was subsequently performed. The patient is being followed up and ALL remitted. CONCLUSION: Leukemia relapse on central nervous system, despite rare, is a sign of poor prognosis and requires prompt treatment. Its occurrence on ocular tissues is even rarer. It is hypothesized that the blood-brain barrier limits the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to the eye and infiltration of the optic nerve by leukemic cells might prejudice the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the cranial space and the optic disc.",['(c) 2021.

Unfortunately, as both physicians and cancer patients are unaware of the possibilities for sperm cryopreservation, the data on evaluation of semen parameters and disposition of cryopreserved samples among Chinese cancer patients are scarce. RESULTS: Male tumours were classified into six major types, germ cell tumours (26 %), haematological neoplasms (28 %), head and neck cancers (19 %), thoracic tumours (4 %), abdominal tumours (10 %), and others (13 %). Haematological neoplasm was the most prevalent cancer among our cohort of patients who opted for sperm banking, followed by germ cell tumours. Patients with germ cell tumours had the lowest pre-thaw and post-thaw seminal sperm concentrations. We separately compared patients with testicular tumours, lymphoma, and leukaemia, and found that leukaemia patients had the lowest pre-thaw sperm concentrations. Most cancer patients (58 %) chose to keep their specimens stored, while 31 % chose to discard the specimens. Over the years, only 13 patients (4 %) returned to use their spermatozoa by assisted reproductive technology. Of the stored samples, patients with germ cell tumours constituted the highest proportion (29.3 %). Moreover, the percentage of haematological neoplasm patients who had no spermatozoa frozen was the highest (46.2 %). CONCLUSIONS: The present data confirm the deleterious impact of various cancers on semen quality. Leukaemia was associated with the worst semen quality and the highest number of semen samples that could not be frozen. We suggest that sperm quality may have decreased even before anti-neoplastic treatment and that sperm banking before treatment should be strongly recommended for cancer patients. A sperm banking programme before gonadotoxic therapy requires close cooperation between assisted reproduction centres and cancer clinics.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: Six studies that reported standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for cancers were selected for meta-analysis. Using a random-effects model, the SMR results from each study were combined for all cancers and leukemias to estimate the summary SMRs (95% confidence interval, CI). To adjust for the healthy worker effect, the relative standardized mortality ratio (rSMR=SMRx/SMRnot x) were calculated using observed and expected counts for the specific cause of interest (i.e., all cancers and leukemias) and the observed and expected counts for all other causes of mortality. Then, the rSMR results were combined to estimate the summary rSMRs (95% CIs). RESULTS: The SMRs for all causes of mortality among semiconductor industry workers ranged from 0.25 to 0.80, which reflects a significant healthy worker effect. A remarkable difference was found between the summary SMRs and the summary rSMRs. The summary SMR for all cancers was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.79) whereas the summary rSMR was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.59). The summary SMR for leukemia was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.07), and the summary rSMR was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.20 to 2.95). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adjustment for the healthy worker effect (i.e., rSMR) may be useful in meta-analyses of cohort studies reporting SMRs.",,"['Hwang, Sung-Ho', 'Park, Moon-Young', 'Lee, Won Jin', 'Park, Inho', 'Hong, Kimyong', 'Park, Donguk', 'Lee, Kyoung-Mu']","['Hwang SH', 'Park MY', 'Lee WJ', 'Park I', 'Hong K', 'Park D', 'Lee KM']","['National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Seoul University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Statistics, Pukyong University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Nursing, Songkok University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Department of Environmental Health, Korea National Open University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Environmental Health, Korea National Open University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20210908,Korea (South),Epidemiol Health,Epidemiology and health,101519472,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Healthy worker effect', 'Meta-analysis', 'Mortality', 'Semiconductor']",2021/09/16 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2021/09/15 20:23'],"['2021/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/15 20:23 [entrez]']","['epih.e2021057 [pii]', '10.4178/epih.e2021057 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Health. 2021;43:e2021057. doi: 10.4178/epih.e2021057.

Here, we find that genetic deletion of the four genes encoding the TCF/LEF transcription factors confers mESCs with the ability to self-renew in N2B27 medium alone. TCF/LEF quadruple knockout (qKO) mESCs display dysregulation of several genes, including Aire, Dnmt3l, and IcosL, located adjacent to each other within a topologically associated domain (TAD). Aire, Dnmt3l, and IcosL appear to be regulated by TCF/LEF in a beta-catenin independent manner. Moreover, downregulation of Aire and Dnmt3l in wild-type mESCs mimics the loss of TCF/LEF and increases mESC survival in the absence of 2iL. Hence, this study identifies TCF/LEF effectors that mediate exit from the pluripotent state.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Understanding the site- and stage-specific variation in hematopoiesis is important if we are to understand the origin of hematological disorders, many of which occur at specific points in the human lifespan. To unravel how the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment changes during human ontogeny and the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms, we compare 57,489 HSPCs from 5 different tissues spanning 4 developmental stages through the human lifetime. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies significant site- and developmental stage-specific transitions in cellular architecture and gene regulatory networks. Hematopoietic stem cells show progression from cycling to quiescence and increased inflammatory signaling during ontogeny. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset for understanding aberrant hematopoiesis through comparison to two cancers that present at distinct time points in postnatal life-juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, a childhood cancer, and myelofibrosis, which classically presents in older adults.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

The impact of KMT2A rearrangements other than t(4;11) is uncertain, and the benefit of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is unclear. We reviewed adult patients with ALL treated at our institution from 1984 to 2019 and identified 50 out of 1102 (5%) with KMT2A rearrangement, including 42 (84%) with t(4;11)/KMT2A-AFF1 and 8 (16%) with other gene partners. The median age was 45 years (range, 18-78 years); median white blood cell count was 109.0 3 109/L (range, 0.5-1573.0). The complete remission (CR) rate was 88%, and the rate of measurable residual disease negativity by flow cytometry at CR was 41% (76% overall during follow-up). At the last follow-up, 14 patients were alive. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9% to 35%), with no difference between t(4;11) and other KMT2A rearrangements (P 5 .87). In a 4-month landmark analysis, the 5-year OS rate was 32% (95% CI, 14% to 70%) in patients who underwent HSCT vs 11% (95% CI, 3-39) in others (P 5 .10). Our study confirms the poor prognosis of ALL with any KMT2A rearrangement and the role of HSCT in these patients.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Age and comorbidities, assessed by the cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS), have been used to address chemotherapy intensity. In the ibrutinib era, it is still unclear whether age, CIRS, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) retain their predictive role on treatment vulnerability. In this series of 712 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with ibrutinib outside clinical trials, baseline ECOG-PS and neutropenia resulted as the most accurate predictors of treatment feasibility and outcomes. Age did not independently influence survival and ibrutinib tolerance, indicating that not age per se, but age-related conditions, may affect drug management. We confirmed the role of CIRS > 6 as a predictor of a poorer progression- and event-free survival (PFS, EFS). The presence of a severe comorbidity was significantly associated with permanent dose reductions (PDRs), not translating into worse outcomes. As expected, del(17p) and/or TP53mut and previous therapies affected PFS, EFS, and overall survival. No study so far has analyzed the influence of concomitant medications and CYP3A inhibitors with ibrutinib. In our series, these factors had no impact, although CYP3A4 inhibitors use correlated with Cox regression analysis, with an increased risk of PDR. Despite the limitation of its retrospective nature, this large study confirmed the role of ECOG-PS as the most accurate predictor of ibrutinib feasibility and outcomes, and importantly, neutropenia emerged as a relevant tool influencing patients' vulnerability. Although CIRS > 6 retained a significant impact on PFS and EFS, its value should be confirmed by prospective studies.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

In order to clarify this issue, the French Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO) performed a 10-year real-world time-dependent analysis. The study enrolled patients between 60 and 70 years of age with AML in CR1 after intensive chemotherapy with intermediate (IR) or unfavorable (UR) risk according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN)-2010. The impact of Allo-HSCT was analyzed through three models, respectively i) time-dependent Cox, ii) multistate for dynamic prediction and iii) super landmark. The study enrolled 369 (73%) IR and 138 (27%) UR AML patients, 203 of whom received an Allo-HSCT. Classical multivariate analysis showed that Allo-HSCT significantly improved relapse-free (RFS; Hazard Ratio/HR [95%CI]: 0.47 [0.35-0.62], p<0.001) and overall (OS; HR [95%CI]: 0.56 [0.42-0.76], p<0.001) survivals, independently of the ELN risk group. With the multistate model, the predicted 5-year probability for IR and UR patients to remain in CR1 without Allo-HSCT was 8% and 1%, respectively. Dynamic predictions confirmed that patients without Allo-HSCT continue to relapse over time. Finally, the super landmark model showed that Allo-HSCT significantly improved RFS (HR [95%CI]: 0.47 [0.36-0.62], p<0.001) and OS (HR [95%CI]: 0.54 [0.40-0.72], p<0.001). Allo-HSCT in CR1 is demonstrated here to significantly improve the outcome of fit older AML patients.

Prior studies have characterized metabolic vulnerabilities of LSCs, which demonstrate preferential reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy metabolism and survival. In the present study, using both genetic and pharmacologic strategies in primary human AML specimens, we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mediates OXPHOS in LSCs. STAT3 regulates AML-specific expression of MYC, which in turn controls transcription of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC1A5. We show that genetic inhibition of MYC or SLC1A5 acts to phenocopy the impairment of OXPHOS observed with STAT3 inhibition, thereby establishing this axis as a regulatory mechanism linking STAT3 to energy metabolism. Inhibition of SLC1A5 reduces intracellular levels of glutamine, glutathione and multiple TCA metabolites, leading to reduced TCA cycle activity and inhibition of OXPHOS. Based on these findings, we used a novel small molecule STAT3 inhibitor, that binds STAT3 and disrupts STAT3-DNA, to evaluate the biological role of STAT3. We show that STAT3 inhibition selectively leads to cell death in AML stem and progenitor cells derived from newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Together, these findings establish a STAT3-mediated mechanism that controls energy metabolism and survival in primitive AML cells.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Amaya, Maria', 'Inguva, Anagha', 'Pei, Shanshan', 'Jones, Courtney L', 'Krug, Anna', 'Ye, Haobin', 'Minhajuddin, Mohammad', 'Winters, Amanda C', 'Furtek, Steffanie L', 'Gamboni, Fabia', 'Stevens, Brett M', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Reigan, Philip', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Amaya M', 'Inguva A', 'Pei S', 'Jones CL', 'Krug A', 'Ye H', 'Minhajuddin M', 'Winters AC', 'Furtek SL', 'Gamboni F', 'Stevens BM', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Pollyea DA', 'Reigan P', 'Jordan CT']","['University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'Institute of Metabolism & Integrative Biology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States.', 'University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210915,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/09/16 06:00,2021/09/16 06:00,['2021/09/15 17:23'],"['2021/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/15 17:23 [entrez]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01604-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021013201 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Sep 15. pii: S0006-4971(21)01604-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021013201.,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9503-5019', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7916-7505', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6519-4860']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The approved CD20 antibodies rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab are of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype. We investigated the impact of the variable regions of these 3 CD20 antibodies when expressed as human IgA2 isotype variants. All 3 IgA2 antibodies mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by macrophages and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by polymorphonuclear cells. Both effector mechanisms were significantly enhanced in the presence of a CD47-blocking antibody or by glutaminyl cyclase inhibition to interfere with CD47-SIRPalpha interactions. Interestingly, an IgA2 variant of obinutuzumab (OBI-IgA2) was consistently more potent than an IgA2 variant of rituximab (RTX-IgA2) or an IgA2 variant of ofatumumab (OFA-IgA2) in triggering ADCC. Furthermore, we observed more effective direct tumor cell killing by OBI-IgA2 compared with RTX-IgA2 and OFA-IgA2, which was caspase independent and required a functional cytoskeleton. IgA2 variants of all 3 antibodies triggered complement-dependent cytotoxicity, with OBI-IgA2 being less effective than RTX-IgA2 and OFA-IgA2. When we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the CD20 IgA2 antibodies in different in vivo models, OBI-IgA2 was therapeutically more effective than RTX-IgA2 or OFA-IgA2. In vivo efficacy required the presence of a functional IgA receptor on effector cells and was independent of complement activation or direct lymphoma cell killing. These data characterize the functional activities of human IgA2 antibodies against CD20, which were affected by the selection of the respective variable regions. OBI-IgA2 proved particularly effective in vitro and in vivo, which may be relevant in the context of CD47-SIRPalpha blockade.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Evers, Mitchell', 'Rosner, Thies', 'Dunkel, Anna', 'Jansen, J H Marco', 'Baumann, Niklas', 'Ten Broeke, Toine', 'Nederend, Maaike', 'Eichholz, Klara', 'Klausz, Katja', 'Reiding, Karli', 'Schewe, Denis M', 'Kellner, Christian', 'Peipp, Matthias', 'Leusen, Jeanette H W', 'Valerius, Thomas']","['Evers M', 'Rosner T', 'Dunkel A', 'Jansen JHM', 'Baumann N', 'Ten Broeke T', 'Nederend M', 'Eichholz K', 'Klausz K', 'Reiding K', 'Schewe DM', 'Kellner C', 'Peipp M', 'Leusen JHW', 'Valerius T']","['Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Section for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Section for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Section for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Section for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Section for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research and Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Utrecht, and Netherlands Proteomics Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia--Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany; and.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Section for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Section for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/09/16 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/09/15 17:23'],"['2021/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/15 17:23 [entrez]']","['S2473-9529(21)00561-9 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004598 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Oct 12;5(19):3807-3820. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004598.,20211101,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']","['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', '*Antigens, CD20', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Rituximab']",19,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4982-6914', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9181-8067']",,PMC8679664,,,,,,,,,,

Early goals-of-care (GOC) discussions may reduce the intensity of end-of-life (EOL) care. Portable Medical Order forms, known as Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) forms in New York state, assist patients in translating GOC discussions into specific medical orders that communicate their wishes during a medical emergency. To determine whether the timing of completion of a MOLST form is associated with EOL care in patients with AML or MDS, we conducted a retrospective study of 358 adult patients with AML or MDS treated at a single academic center and its affiliated sites, who died during a 5-year period. One-third of patients completed at least 1 MOLST form >30 days before death. Compared with patients who completed a MOLST form within 30 days of death or never, those who completed a MOLST form >30 days before death were less likely to receive transfusion (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.39; P < .01), chemotherapy (AOR, 0.24; P < .01), or life-sustaining treatments (AOR, 0.21; P < .01) or to be admitted to the ICU (AOR, 0.21; P < .01) at EOL. They were also more likely to use hospice services (AOR, 2.72; P < .01).

Twenty-one patients (median age 61) received 30 mg/m(2) fludarabine for 6 days and BU for 4 days, starting from 3.2 mg/m(2) and subsequently adjusted to the target area under the curve (AUC) of 6000 micromol-min/L. The median AUC of day 1 (AUC1), AUC4, and their average were 4871.3, 6021.0, and 5368.1 micromol-min/L, respectively. Veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (VOD/SOS) occurred in five patients (24%) but all recovered well. Four patients (20%) had non-infectious pulmonary complications (NIPCs). Patients with high AUC1 had frequent gastrointestinal adverse events, but similar incidence of VOD/SOS and NIPCs. Two-year overall survival (OS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), and relapse rates were 44.4%, 28.6%, and 29.1%, respectively. Patients with high AUC1 had significantly high NRM (57.1% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.04) and inferior OS (14.3% vs. 60.1%, P = 0.002), while patients with high AUC4 had a significantly low relapse rate (8.3% vs. 55.6%, P = 0.02). In conclusion, once-daily BU and a PK-guided dose intensification were beneficial for reducing relapse in elderly patients with AML/MDS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted at Molecular Lab of Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January 2017 to December 2018. A total of 150 blood specimens from 30 patients with CML were analyzed at regular intervals during therapy. The detection/quantification of transcript mRNA was done simultaneously using QPCR and the EPF method. RESULTS: Out of a total of 150 RNA specimens analyzed, 117 (78%) specimens were positive, whereas 33 (22%) were negative for the transcript using both methods at various stages of treatment. Strong linear negative correlations between the cycle threshold and relative fluorescence unit values were observed with P <.0001 at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. No significant difference (P >.05) between the means of the BCR-ABL percentage was observed in either method at all stages of treatment. The bias between the 2 methods was calculated as 0.069 +/- 3.50, and 95% limits of agreement were 6.92% to -6.79%. CONCLUSION: We found that EPF is s simple method to detect/quantify BCR-ABL mRNA expression during treatment with comparable results to QPCR.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

The cattle were seropositive by ELISA when selected while being surveyed for the detection of BLV. Among six cows, two were cases of persistent lymphocytosis (PL). Cytopathology was characterized by the formation of multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Moreover, the viruses produced clear plaques on the monolayer of the primary fetal calf kidney (FCK) cells. Inhibition of plaque formation by BLV-antisera suggested a diagnosis of BLV, which was further confirmed by PCR. Cells infected with the isolates were positive to a monoclonal antibody against the viral gp51 trans-membrane glycoprotein by immunocytochemistry. Both isolates replicated and induced cytopathic effects in bovine and human cell line cultures. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial gp51 env gene sequences revealed that Iraqi strain highly homogenous with Turkey strain (100%) and had 1% distance value with other world strains. In conclusion, this present study found that BLV-infected cattle with PL can be a source for viral isolation, and the cytopathological features of the virus infection are arranged and differ depending on the cell type. This is the first study to report on the isolation of the EBL virus in Iraq, and it provides the basis for further studies about a BLV Iraqi strain that can help control this disease.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Khudhair, Yahia Ismail', 'Al-Shammari, Ahmed Majeed', 'Hasso, Saleem Amin', 'Yaseen, Nahi']","['Khudhair YI', 'Al-Shammari AM', 'Hasso SA', 'Yaseen N']","['Department of internal and preventive Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Al-Qadisiyah, Iraq.', 'Experimental Therapy Department, Iraqi Center for Cancer and Medical Genetic Research, Mustansiriyah University, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Department of internal and preventive Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Experimental Therapy Department, Iraqi Center for Cancer and Medical Genetic Research, Mustansiriyah University, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210830,Netherlands,Vet Anim Sci,Veterinary and animal science,101694897,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bovine leukemia virus', 'Cytopathic effects', 'Iraq', 'Persistent lymphocytosis', 'Virus isolation']",2021/09/16 06:00,2021/09/16 06:01,['2021/09/15 07:20'],"['2020/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/15 07:20 [entrez]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.vas.2021.100201 [doi]', 'S2451-943X(21)00037-5 [pii]']",epublish,Vet Anim Sci. 2021 Aug 30;14:100201. doi: 10.1016/j.vas.2021.100201. eCollection 2021 Dec.,,,,,"['Authors declares that there is no conflict of interest.

Here we report the case of a 64-year-old woman with a collision tumor in her left breast mass that was composed of invasive ductal carcinoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, we reviewed the published comparable English-language literature. Collision breast tumor composed of BC and NHL is extremely rare. For that reason, there is a lack of consensus about the underlying mechanism, and diagnosing it without delay remains a complex clinical challenge. We found that post-menopausal, age-related estrogen levels changes and Epstein-Barr virus infection are possible pathogenic factors. However, the symptoms are almost identical, and it is difficult to distinguish a simple breast tumor from a breast collision tumor. In this study, we reviewed the clinical features of all patients with BC and NHL colliding breast tumors; this information might enable early identification and prevention of misdiagnosis.","['(c) 2021 Xiaowen Chen et al., published by De Gruyter.']","['Chen, Xiaowen', 'Chen, Jianli', 'Liao, Sihai', 'Cao, Yuwen']","['Chen X', 'Chen J', 'Liao S', 'Cao Y']","['Department of Oncology Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China.', 'The Third Department of Medical Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.', 'Department of Oncology Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210827,Poland,Open Life Sci,Open life sciences,101669614,,['NOTNLM'],"['SLL/CLL', 'breast carcinoma', 'collision tumor', 'invasive ductal carcinoma', 'lymphoma']",2021/09/16 06:00,2021/09/16 06:01,['2021/09/15 07:20'],"['2021/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/15 07:20 [entrez]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/biol-2021-0093 [doi]', 'biol-2021-0093 [pii]']",epublish,Open Life Sci. 2021 Aug 27;16(1):867-871. doi: 10.1515/biol-2021-0093. eCollection 2021.,,,,1,['Conflict of interest: The authors state no conflict of interest.'],,,PMC8402943,,,,,,,,,,

However, its role in the afebrile and asymptomatic patient presenting with an isolated cytopenia is not well established. This study was conducted to determine the indications for bone marrow examination and its diagnostic yield, in HIV-positive patients at Tygerberg Hospital. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive study was performed over a 3-year period from 01 September 2015 to 31 August 2018. The bone marrow examination reports for the HIV-positive patients who had a bone marrow examination during the study period were retrieved. Clinical and laboratory information was captured. Results: Altogether 374 bone marrow reports for HIV-positive patients were found. The indication of the bone marrow examination included investigation of unexplained cytopenias, suspected haematological malignancies, follow-up examination for patients with known haematological diseases, staging of haematological or non-haematological malignancies and investigation of suspected disseminated infection. The patients' median age was 43 years and the interquartile range was 27-60 years. There was a slight female predominance with females 51% and males 49%. The diagnostic yield was 33.7%. Acute leukaemia and lymphoma were the most common diagnoses. Haematinic deficiency and pure red cell aplasia were found in the majority of cases with isolated anaemia. All cases with isolated thrombocytopenia were due to immune thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: Bone marrow examination is a useful investigation for HIV-positive patients with cytopenias, suspected haematological malignancy and lymphoma staging. However, its early use in patients with isolated anaemia and isolated thrombocytopenia is questionable.",['(c) 2021.

CLL results due to uncontrolled accumulation of B lymphocytes in the body with the clinical spectrum ranging from comparatively benign disease to an aggressive form. The disease pathogenesis lies in molecular genetics, the most common alteration being the deletion in the long arm of chromosome 13, at position 14 (13q14) region. This deletion leads to the loss of important microRNAs which are involved in maintaining the critical balance of the apoptosis mechanism of cell death of B lymphocytes. As such, the imbalance contributes towards B cells' immortality and, thus, CLL arises. This significant 13q14 deletion contributes to CLL's pathogenesis and paves the way for CLL treatment, hence affecting the prognosis of the affected patients. Furthermore, the size of deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q) has a remarkable effect on its prognosis and therapeutic intervention. The minimal deleted region (MDR)/small deletion or long 13q loss/mutation, and biallelic 13q deletion or monoallelic 13q deletion are commonly seen. 13q14 deletion is an initiating defect targeting tumor suppressor gene locus deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2 (DLEU2))/microRNA15A (MIR15A)/microRNA 16-1 (MIR 16-1). Regarding CLL treatment, conventional therapy with alkylating agents has been used for a long time, which reported low- to non-existent complete remission rates and adverse events after prolonged use. Moreover, research into the 13q14 deletion has also provided new insights into the molecular genetics and pathways that interact in such a way, making it possible to transform healthy cells into malignant cells in an entirely new fashion with a complete disregard to its original form, resulting in CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Khalid et al.']","['Khalid, Khizer', 'Padda, Jaskamal', 'Syam, Mohammad', 'Moosa, Amir', 'Kakani, Varsha', 'Sanka, Sujana', 'Zubair, Ujala', 'Padda, Sandeep', 'Cooper, Ayden Charlene', 'Jean-Charles, Gutteridge']","['Khalid K', 'Padda J', 'Syam M', 'Moosa A', 'Kakani V', 'Sanka S', 'Zubair U', 'Padda S', 'Cooper AC', 'Jean-Charles G']","['Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Avalon University School of Medicine, Willemstad, CUW.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Kakatiya Medical College, Warangal, IND.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Family Medicine, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, PAK.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Avalon University School of Medicine, Willemstad, CUW.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Advent Health and Orlando Health Hospital/JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210802,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['13q14', 'b lymphocytes', 'chemotherapy', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll)', 'microrna']",2021/09/16 06:00,2021/09/16 06:01,['2021/09/15 07:17'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/15 07:17 [entrez]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.16839 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Aug 2;13(8):e16839. doi: 10.7759/cureus.16839. eCollection 2021 Aug.,,,,8,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,PMC8424995,,,,,,,,,,

The polyamine analog verlindamycin inhibits the polyamine biosynthesis pathway enzymes SMOX and PAOX, as well as the histone demethylase LSD1. Based on our previous research in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we reasoned verlindamycin may also unblock neuroblastoma differentiation when combined with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Indeed, co-treatment with verlindamycin and ATRA strongly induced differentiation regardless of MYCN status, but in MYCN-expressing cells, protein levels were strongly diminished. This process was not transcriptionally regulated but was due to increased degradation of MYCN protein, at least in part via ubiquitin-independent, proteasome-dependent destruction. Here we report that verlindamycin effectively induces the expression of functional tumor suppressor-antizyme via ribosomal frameshifting. Consistent with previous results describing the function of antizyme, we found that verlindamycin treatment led to the selective targeting of ornithine decarboxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis) as well as key oncoproteins, such as cyclin D and Aurora A kinase. Retinoid-based multimodal differentiation therapy is one of the few interventions that extends relapse-free survival in MYCN-associated high-risk neuroblastoma and these results point toward the potential use of verlindamycin in this regimen.",['(c) 2021.

We identified an amplification unit spanning 11 genes, from the DHFR gene to the ATP6AP1L gene position, with high adjusted interaction frequencies on chromosome 5 (~2.2 Mbp) and a twenty-fold tandemly amplified region, and novel inversions at the start and end positions of the amplified region as well as frameshift insertions in most of the MSH and MLH genes were detected. These mutations might stimulate chromosomal breakage and cause the dysregulation of mismatch repair.

Here, we characterized the role of KCTD15 in different physiological/pathological states to gain insights into its diversified function(s). The silencing of KCTD15 in MLL-rearranged leukemia models induced attenuation of the NF-kappaB pathway associated with a downregulation of pIKK-beta and pIKB-alpha. Conversely, the activation of peripheral blood T cells upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation remarkably upregulated KCTD15 and, simultaneously, pIKK-beta and pIKB-alpha. Moreover, a significant upregulation of KCTD15 was also observed in CD34 hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells where the NF-kappaB pathway is physiologically activated. The association between KCTD15 upregulation and increased NF-kappaB signaling was confirmed by luciferase assay as well as KCTD15 and IKK-beta proximity ligation and immunoprecipitation experiments.

Distinct myeloma transcriptome profiles are primarily driven by myeloma initiating events (MIE) and converge into a mutually exclusive overexpression of the CCND1 and CCND2 oncogenes. Here, with reference to their normal counterparts, we find that myeloma PC enhanced chromatin accessibility combined with paired transcriptome profiling can classify MIE-defined genetic subgroups. Across and within different MM genetic subgroups, we ascribe regulation of genes and pathways critical for myeloma biology to unique or shared, developmentally activated or de novo formed candidate enhancers. Such enhancers co-opt recruitment of existing transcription factors, which although not transcriptionally deregulated per se, organise aberrant gene regulatory networks that help identify myeloma cell dependencies with prognostic impact.

Activation of the innate immune system through various ligands and signaling pathways is an important driver of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The DAMPs, or alarmins, which activate the inflammasome pathway via the TLR4/NLR signaling cascade causes the lytic cell death of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), ineffective hematopoiesis, and beta-catenin-induced proliferation of cancer cells, leading to the development of MDS/AML phenotype. It is also associated with other myeloid malignancies and involved in the pathogenesis of associated cytopenias. Ongoing research suggests the interplay of inflammasome mediators with immune modulators and transcription factors to have a significant role in the development of myeloid diseases, and possibly therapy resistance. This review discusses the role and importance of inflammasomes and immune pathways in myeloid malignancies, particularly MDS/AML, to better understand the disease pathophysiology and decipher the scope of therapeutic interventions.",['(c) 2021.

We examined whether the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Leukemia (FACT-Leu) predicted OS beyond established prognostic factors among these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were from AML2002 (n=309), a randomized phase 2/3 study comparing decitabine plus talacotuzumab versus decitabine alone in older AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. We used ridge-penalized Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between baseline FACT-Leu scales and OS. We then conducted a bootstrap analysis to determine how often FACT-Leu scales appeared in forward- and backward- selected ""final models"" predicting OS relative to prognosticators from the AML Composite Model (AML-CM; e.g., chronic comorbidities, previous cancer, cytogenetic/molecular risk). RESULTS: In ridge-penalized models, the FACT-Leu Physical Well-Being (PWB), Trial Outcomes Index (TOI), and Total scales predicted OS. Adjusting for AML-CM factors, an important increase (3 points) in PWB score was associated with a 14% reduction in the hazard of death. In the bootstrap analysis, the PWB scale appeared in 93% of backward- and 98% of forward selected models, while the TOI [57% (backward), 79% (forward)] and FACT-Leu Total [51% (backward), 78% (forward)] appeared less often in final models. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate PROs' value for predicting outcomes among older AML patients and underscore the need to more systematically collect PRO data in routine care with these patients.

Tisagenlecleucel was the first approved CAR T-cell therapy in Australia. The treatment has been made available to Australian patients in specialist public hospitals through federal and state funding. Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) is one of Australia's oldest tertiary referral public health care institutions and was approved for the provision of CAR T-cell therapy service in 2019. A multi-disciplinary clinical program has been established for the collection and cryopreservation of donor cells shipped for manufacturing as well as for the receipt, storage and administration of CAR T-cell therapy and patient management. The program encompasses a Therapeutic Goods Administration-accredited apheresis unit and a state-of-the-art facility for cell processing, cryopreservation and storage.

Furthermore, many compounds seem to be able to take part to the leukemogenesis and lymphomagenesis process, and in the onset of multiple myeloma. In this review, we will assess the possibility that neurotransmitters and neuropeptides may have a role in the onset of haematological neoplasms, may affect the response to treatment or may represent a useful starting point for a new therapeutic approach. More in vivo investigations are needed to evaluate neuropeptide's role in haematological malignancies and the possible utilization as an antitumor therapeutic target. Comprehending the effect of the pharmacological administration of neuropeptide modulators on hematologic malignancies opens up new possibilities in curing clonal hematologic diseases to achieve more satisfactory outcomes.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Allegra, Alessandro', ""Sant'Antonio, Emanuela"", 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Ettari, Roberta']","['Allegra A', ""Sant'Antonio E"", 'Musolino C', 'Ettari R']","['Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood, University of Messina.

To determine their incidence, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive adult patients (N = 127) with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treated from 2017 through 2020 with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel; n = 89) or a bispecific CD19/CD22 CAR (n = 38). Twelve (9.4%) and 8 (6.3%) patients developed bleeding and thrombosis within the first 3 months, respectively. In the axi-cel subgroup, these occurred in 11.2% and 6.7%, respectively. Bleeding occurred between days 8 and 30 (median, 17.5) and thrombosis between days 2 and 91 (median, 29). Bleeding sites included genitourinary, soft tissue, intracranial, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary and were associated with features of consumptive coagulopathy. On univariate analysis, patients with bleeding were older, had lower baseline platelets (86 x 103/muL vs 178 x 103/muL; P < .01), lower platelet and fibrinogen nadirs , and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Immune effector cell (IEC)-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) grade >/=3 was associated with increased bleeding (50% vs 15%; P = .01), thrombosis (50% vs 16%; P = .04), prothrombin time prolongation, hypofibrinogenemia, and elevated D-dimer. Low pretreatment platelet counts were associated with bleeding in a multivariate logistic regression model. Patients with thrombocytopenia or severe ICANS are at increased risk of bleeding and should be closely monitored, particularly within the first month after CAR therapy. Future studies in larger cohorts should assess risk factors for systemic coagulopathies in CAR T therapy, including their association with neurotoxicity.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Exposure during childhood is associated with a greater excess relative risk for leukemia and tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) than exposure in later life. Cancer risks associated with low-dose exposure (<100 mSv) are uncertain. We previously investigated the association between the incidence of childhood cancer and levels of exposure to external background radiation from terrestrial gamma and cosmic rays in Switzerland using data from a nationwide census-based cohort study. Here, we provide an update of that study using an extended follow-up period and an improved exposure model. METHODS: We included all children 0-15 years of age registered in the Swiss national censuses 1990, 2000, and 2010-2015. We identified incident cancer cases during 1990-2016 using probabilistic record linkage with the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. Exposure to terrestrial and cosmic radiation at children's place of residence was estimated using geographic exposure models based on aerial spectrometric gamma-ray measurements. We estimated and included the contribution from (137)Cs deposition after the Chernobyl accident. We created a nested case-control sample and fitted conditional logistic regression models adjusting for sex, year of birth, neighborhood socioeconomic position, and modelled outdoor NO2 concentration. We also estimated the population attributable fraction for childhood cancer due to external background radiation. RESULTS: We included 3,401,113 children and identified 3,137 incident cases of cancer, including 951 leukemia, 495 lymphoma, and 701 CNS tumor cases. Median follow-up in the cohort was 6.0 years (interquartile range: 4.3-10.1) and median cumulative exposure since birth was 8.2 mSv (range: 0-31.2). Hazard ratios per 1 mSv increase in cumulative dose of external background radiation were 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.06) for all cancers combined, 1.06 (1.01-1.10) for leukemia, 1.03 (0.98-1.08) for lymphoma, and 1.06 (1.01-1.11) for CNS tumors. Adjustment for potential confounders had little effect on the results. Based on these results, the estimated population attributable fraction for leukemia and CNS tumors due to external background radiation was 32% (7-49%) and 34% (5-51%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that background ionizing radiation contributes to the risk of leukemia and CNS tumors in children.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

To uncover DNA methylation changes critical for WT pathogenesis, we compared the epigenome of foetal kidney with two WT cell lines, filtering our results to remove common cancer-associated epigenetic changes and to enrich for genes involved in early kidney development. This identified four hypermethylated genes, of which ESRP2 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2) was the most promising for further study. ESRP2 was commonly repressed by DNA methylation in WT, and this occurred early in WT development (in nephrogenic rests). ESRP2 expression was reactivated by DNA methyltransferase inhibition in WT cell lines. When ESRP2 was overexpressed in WT cell lines, it inhibited cellular proliferation in vitro, and in vivo it suppressed tumour growth of orthotopic xenografts in nude mice. RNA-seq of the ESRP2-expressing WT cell lines identified several novel splicing targets. We propose a model in which epigenetic inactivation of ESRP2 disrupts the mesenchymal to epithelial transition in early kidney development to generate WT.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The objective was to describe two cases of T-PLL with cutaneous involvement and to present a review of the literature concerning the clinical characteristics, differential diagnosis and treatment of these patients. CASE REPORTS: 1) 79 year-old man, with a previous diagnosis of T-PLL based on a laboratory incidental finding. He had been treated with alemtuzumab, but it had to be interrupted due to recurrent infections. After interrupting the treatment, the patient developed a symmetrical rash on his extremities. The skin biopsy demonstrated TPLL infiltration. 2) 28 year-old man that presented with asthenia and lymphocytosis. He also showed a purpuric rash on his trunk and facial erythema. Histopathology of the skin and bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis of T-PLL with cutaneous involvement. CONCLUSIONS: T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia accounts for 2% of mature leukemias in adults. Skin involvement is reported in 20-50% of the patients. The characteristic features are facial involvement, purpuric lesions and symmetry of the rash, although there are atypical manifestations as well. Differential diagnosis includes other T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders with hematologic and skin involvement, such as Sezary syndrome. Patients with T-PLL may show cutaneous infiltration at the moment of debut or relapse of the disease.

Knowledge about resource use/costs can help in better resource planning to improve care and outcomes efficiently. In this study, we estimated patterns and trends of hospital resource use and costs for children with cancer (n = 8886, aged 0-18 years) treated at Children's Cancer Hospital, Egypt (CCHE), between 2013 and 2017, by ICCC-3 groups, at one and three years post-diagnosis. METHODS: We estimated costs from the healthcare provider perspective, expressed in USD 2019. We also studied resource use/cost trends, and factors associated with inpatient days and costs. RESULTS: For all cancers combined, median costs were $14,774 (IQR: $6,559-$23,738) at one year and $19,799 (IQR: $8,921-$34,204) at three years post-diagnosis. Median inpatient days were 38 days (IQR: 17-60) at one year, and 43 days (IQR: 20-74) at three years post-diagnosis. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and neuroblastoma imposed the greatest financial burden on CCHE, representing 53.1% of total costs. AML patients had the highest costs/resource use of all childhood cancers. Cost trends decreased by 2.9% (P < 0.001) for all cancers combined, due to economic instability in Egypt between 2013 and 2017. The use of IV supportive drugs increased by 24.3% (P < 0.001) over time for children with solid tumors. CONCLUSION: These findings will inform hospital resource planning and budgeting to promote value in care delivery, with implications for pediatric oncology practice and policy in Egypt/CCHE.

Dox compromises topoisomerase II enzyme functionality, thus inducing structural damages during DNA replication and causes direct damages intercalating into DNA double helix. Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damages by activating the ATM-CHK2 and/or ATR-CHK1 pathway, whose function is to regulate cell cycle progression, to promote damage repair, and to control apoptosis. We evaluated the efficacy of a new drug schedule combining Dox and specific ATR (VE-821) or CHK1 (prexasertib, PX) inhibitors in the treatment of human B-/T cell precursor ALL cell lines and primary ALL leukemic cells. We found that ALL cell lines respond to Dox activating the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. Exposure of Dox-pretreated ALL cell lines to VE-821 or PX enhanced Dox cytotoxic effect. This phenomenon was associated with the abrogation of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint with changes in the expression pCDK1 and cyclin B1, and cell entry in mitosis, followed by the induction of apoptosis. Indeed, the inhibition of the G2/M checkpoint led to a significant increment of normal and aberrant mitotic cells, including those showing tripolar spindles, metaphases with lagging chromosomes, and massive chromosomes fragmentation. In conclusion, we found that the ATR-CHK1 pathway is involved in the response to Dox-induced DNA damages and we demonstrated that our new in vitro drug schedule that combines Dox followed by ATR/CHK1 inhibitors can increase Dox cytotoxicity against ALL cells, while using lower drug doses. * Doxorubicin activates the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. * ALL cells respond to doxorubicin-induced DNA damages by activating the ATR-CHK1 pathway. * The inhibition of the ATR-CHK1 pathway synergizes with doxorubicin in the induction of cytotoxicity in ALL cells. * The inhibition of ATR-CHK1 pathway induces aberrant chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle defects in doxorubicin-pretreated ALL cells.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of adults with a new diagnosis of hematologic malignancy (April 1, 2006-March 31, 2017) in Ontario, Canada. We described the baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory predictors of ICU admission and subsequent mortality. The primary outcome was the incidence of ICU admission within 1 year of hematologic malignancy diagnosis. We assessed the predictors of ICU admission using Cox-proportional models that accounted for the competing risk of death and reported as subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 87,965 patients (mean [SD] age, 67.8 (15.7) years) were included. The 1-year incidence of ICU admission was 13.9% (median time 35 days), ranging from 7.3% (indolent lymphoma) to 22.5% (acute myeloid leukemia). After multivariable adjustment, compared to indolent lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia (sHR, 3.09; 95% CI 2.84-3.35), aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (sHR, 2.47; 95% CI 2.31-2.65) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sHR, 2.46; 95% CI 2.15-2.80) had the highest risk of ICU admission. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (sHR, 2.09; 95% CI 2.01-2.19), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (sHR, 1.33; 95% CI 1.26-1.39) and baseline laboratory abnormalities (anemia, thrombocytopenia and high creatinine) were also associated with ICU admission. Among ICU patients, 36.7% required invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality was 31%.

We aimed to examine the associations using large-scale prospective data. METHODS: Data were pooled from six population-based birth cohorts in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Norway, the UK and the USA (recruitment 1950s-2000s). Primary outcomes were any childhood leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL); secondary outcomes were acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and any childhood cancer. Exposures included maternal self-reported infections [influenza-like illness, common cold, any respiratory tract infection, vaginal thrush, vaginal infections and urinary tract infection (including cystitis)] and infection-associated symptoms (fever and diarrhoea) during pregnancy. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using multilevel Cox models. RESULTS: Among 312 879 children with a median follow-up of 13.6 years, 167 leukaemias, including 129 ALL and 33 AML, were identified. Maternal urinary tract infection was associated with increased risk of any leukaemia [HR (95% CI) 1.68 (1.10-2.58)] and subtypes ALL [1.49 (0.87-2.56)] and AML [2.70 ([0.93-7.86)], but not with any cancer [1.13 (0.85-1.51)]. Respiratory tract infection was associated with increased risk of any leukaemia [1.57 (1.06-2.34)], ALL [1.43 (0.94-2.19)], AML [2.37 (1.10-5.12)] and any cancer [1.33 (1.09-1.63)]; influenza-like illness showed a similar pattern but with less precise estimates. There was no evidence of a link between other infections and any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract and respiratory tract infections during pregnancy may be associated with childhood leukaemia, but the absolute risk is small given the rarity of the outcome.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021; all rights reserved.

Regardless, the regulatory role and mechanism of OSR1 in acute myeloid leukaemia are scarce. Firstly, the CD34-positive blasts or the normal blasts were isolated from the plasma samples of acute myeloid leukaemia patients or healthy donors, respectively. Expression of OSR1 analysis by western blot and qRT-PCR showed that OSR1 was reduced in CD34-positive blasts and acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines. Secondly, acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines were transfected with pcDNA vector or shRNA for the over-expression or silence of OSR1, respectively. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of OSR1 decreased cell viability and repressed the proliferation of acute myeloid leukaemia cells, while promoted the cell apoptosis. Silence of OSR1 contributed to the proliferation of acute myeloid leukaemia cells and suppressed the cell apoptosis. Thirdly, over-expression of OSR1 decreased protein expression of leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) and JNK phosphorylation in the acute myeloid leukaemia cells. Ectopic expression of LGR5 attenuated OSR1 over-expression-induced decrease of LGR5 and JNK phosphorylation. Lastly, ectopic expression of LGR5 attenuated OSR1 over-expression-induced decrease of cell viability and proliferation in acute myeloid leukaemia cells.

We also aim to determine whether our findings are similar or different to those described in literature for paediatric patients in general. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in paediatric ALL/lymphoma patients on chemotherapy, and cases with positive CSF HSV-PCR with at least one head MRI scan were included. On imaging, location(typical/atypical), post-contrast enhancement and haemorrhage/diffusivity/gliosis were evaluated. RESULT: A total of 28 scans were included in study from 16 patients fulfilling inclusion criteria, 12 (75%) HSV-1 and 4 (25%) HSV-2. Of the 16 initial scans (CT n = 10, MRI n = 6), 11 were normal (CT = 7, MRI = 4). Fourteen patients had follow-up MRI, of which two had normal scans. On the abnormal initial scan (5/16), only 20% had typical medial temporal/inferomedial frontal/cingulate involvement. Most had frontal (80%), parietal (60%) and non-medial temporal (40%) lesions. Abnormal diffusivity/haemorrhage was absent in all, and postcontrast enhancement was seen in 20%. On follow-up, more patients (33%) had typical medial temporal/inferomedial frontal/cingulate involvement. Widespread atypical site involvement of frontoparietal (75%), thalamus (58%), non-medial temporal (50%), occipital/basal ganglia (33%) and cerebellum (8%) was noted. Most lesions were cortical (91%)/subcortical (75%) with few periventricular lesions (58%).

The oxidative stress injury in hepatocytes (L02) was induced by H2O2. Human umbilical cord blood MSC-CM (UCB-MSC-CM) was prepared. The effects of UCB-MSC-CM on the proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory response in L02 cells were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Subsequently, the target of miR-486-5p was predicted using bioinformatics analysis, and the possible signaling pathway addressed by miR-486-5p was explored using western blot. We found that miR-486-5p expression was elevated following oxidative stress injury and was reduced after UCB-MSC-CM treatment. UCB-MSC-CM protected L02 cells against H2O2-induced injury by downregulation of miR-486-5p. Proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) was verified to be targeted by miR-486-5p. UCB-MSC-CM upregulated the expression of PIM1 reduced by H2O2 in L02 cells. Additionally, silencing PIM1 attenuated the protective effects of miR-486-5p downregulation against oxidative stress injury. We further demonstrated that UCB-MSC-CM inhibited the TGF-beta/Smad signaling in H2O2-treated L02 cells by the miR-486-5p/PIM1 axis. Overall, UCB-MSC-CM attenuates oxidative stress injury in hepatocytes by downregulating miR-486-5p and upregulating PIM1, which may be related to the inhibition of TGF-beta/Smad pathway.",,"['Ma, Ning', 'Li, Shuo', 'Lin, Chao', 'Cheng, Xianbin', 'Meng, Zihui']","['Ma N', 'Li S', 'Lin C', 'Cheng X', 'Meng Z']","['Department of Hepatobiliary-Pancreatic Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary-Pancreatic Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary-Pancreatic Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Colorectal and Anal Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary-Pancreatic Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Oxidative injury', '*PIM1', '*TGF-beta/Smad pathway', '*UCB-MSC-CM', '*miR-486-5p']",2021/09/15 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/09/14 08:41'],"['2021/09/14 08:41 [entrez]', '2021/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21655979.2021.1972196 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2021 Dec;12(1):6434-6447. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2021.1972196.,20220113,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (MIRN486 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']","['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/*pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hepatocytes', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smad Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism']",1,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2553-081X'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the HCB cohort, the cumulative incidence of transformation at 5 years was 15%. Predictors for transformation were cytopenias, hypoalbuminaemia, complex karyotype (CK) and both the Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi (ILL) and simplified Haemoglobin, Platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and extrahilar Lymphadenopathy (HPLL)/ABC scores (P < 0.05). The only independent predictor for transformation in multivariate analysis was CK [hazard ratio (HR) 4.025, P = 0.05]. Patients with SMZL-T had a significantly higher risk of death than the remainder (HR 3.89, P < 0.001). Of the 36 patients with SMZL-T, one developed Hodgkin lymphoma and 35 a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 71% with a non-germinal centre phenotype. The main features were B symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and high serum LDH. CK was observed in 12/22 (55%) SMZL-T and fluorescence in situ hybridisation detected abnormalities of MYC proto-oncogene, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (MYC), B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and/or BCL6 in six of 14 (43%). In all, 21 patients received immunochemotherapy, six chemotherapy, one radiotherapy and three splenectomy. The complete response (CR) rate was 61% and the median survival from transformation was 4.92 years.

So, we aimed to compare patients with haematologic malignancies to patients without malignancies, matched by sex and age and hospitalised for COVID-19 at the same time and in the same centre. Among 25 patients with haematologic malignancies, we found that mortality (40% versus 4%, p < 0.01), number of days with RT-PCR positivity (21.2 +/- 15.9 days [range, 3-57] versus 7.4 +/- 5.6 days [range, 1-24], p < 0.01), maximal viral load (mean minimal Ct, 17.2 +/- 5.2 [range, 10-30] versus 26.5 +/- 5.1 [range, 15-33], p < 0.0001) and the delay between symptom onset and clinical worsening (mean time duration between symptom onset and first day of maximum requirement in inspired oxygen fraction, 14.3 +/- 10.7 days versus 9.6 +/- 3.7 days, p = 0.0485) were higher than in other patients. COVID-19 course in patients with haematologic malignancies has a delayed onset and is more severe with a higher mortality, and patients may be considered as super-spreaders.

34518841,NLM,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,20210916,,,2021 Sep 7,Immunogenicity of Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccination followed by J&J adenovirus COVID-19 vaccination in two CLL patients.,,2021.09.02.21262146 [pii] 10.1101/2021.09.02.21262146 [doi],"Importance: Individuals with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia have significant immune disfunction, often further disrupted by treatment. While currently available COVID-19 vaccinations are highly effective in immunocompetent individuals, they are often poorly immunogenic in CLL patients. It is important to understand the role heterologous boost would have in patients who did not respond to the recommended two-dose mRNA vaccine series with a SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response. Objective: To characterize the immune response of two CLL patients who failed to seroconvert after initial mRNA vaccine series following a third, heterologous, COVID-19 vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Design: Two subjects with CLL were enrolled in an IRB-approved observational longitudinal cohort study of the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. After enrollment, they received a third vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Blood was drawn prior to original vaccination series, four weeks after mRNA vaccination, and again four weeks after third vaccination. Setting: Eligible subjects were approached by oncologist overseeing CLL treatment and informed about study, at time of enrollment subjects consented to join the cohort study. Participants: Sixteen subjects enrolled in the larger CLL cohort study, of whom two subjects received a third COVID-19 vaccination and were included in this analysis. Subject 1 is CLL treatment naive, while Subject 2 is currently on active treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response, including plasma antibodies, memory B-cells, CD4 and CD8 T-cells were assessed prior to vaccination (baseline) as well as post vaccination series and post third dose. Results: Of the two subjects who received Ad26.COV2.S doses, Subject 1 seroconverted, had RBD-specific memory B-cells as well as spike-specific CD4 T-cells while Subject 2 did not.

This malignancy is frequently preceded by transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), which is self-limited expansion of fetal liver-derived megakaryocyte progenitors. An array of international studies has led to consensus in treating ML-DS with reduced-intensity chemotherapy, leading to excellent outcomes. In addition, studies performed in the past 20 years have revealed many of the genetic and epigenetic features of the tumors, including GATA1 mutations that are arguably associated with all cases of both TAM and ML-DS. Despite these advances in understanding the clinical and biological aspects of ML-DS, little is known about the mechanisms of relapse. Upon relapse, patients face a poor outcome, and there is no consensus on treatment. Future studies need to be focused on this challenging aspect of leukemia in children with DS.","['(c) 2021.

Treatment of healthy humans and mice with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) dramatically increases OSM release in blood and BM. Using mice null for the OSM receptor (OSMR) gene, we demonstrate that OSM provides a negative feed-back acting as a brake on HSPC mobilization in response to clinically relevant mobilizing molecules G-CSF and CXCR4 antagonist. Likewise, injection of a recombinant OSM molecular trap made of OSMR complex extracellular domains enhances HSC mobilization in poor mobilizing C57BL/6 and NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ mice. Mechanistically, OSM attenuates HSC chemotactic response to CXCL12 and increases HSC homing to the BM signaling indirectly via BM endothelial and mesenchymal cells which are the only cells expressing OSMR in the BM. OSM up-regulates E-selectin expression on BM endothelial cells indirectly increasing HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing of HSCs from Osmr(-/-) and wild-type mice suggest that HSCs have altered cytoskeleton reorganization, energy usage and cycling in the absence of OSM signaling in niches. Therefore OSM is an important regulator of HSC niche function restraining HSC mobilization and anti-OSM therapy combined with current mobilizing regimens may improve HSPC mobilization for transplantation.","['(c) 2021.

Here, we find that increased abundance of the ubiquitin ligase RNF5 contributes to AML development and survival. High RNF5 expression in AML patient specimens correlates with poor prognosis. RNF5 inhibition decreases AML cell growth in culture, in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples and in vivo, and delays development of MLL-AF9-driven leukemogenesis in mice, prolonging their survival. RNF5 inhibition causes transcriptional changes that overlap with those seen upon histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 inhibition. RNF5 induces the formation of K29 ubiquitin chains on the histone-binding protein RBBP4, promoting its recruitment to and subsequent epigenetic regulation of genes involved in AML maintenance. Correspondingly, RNF5 or RBBP4 knockdown enhances AML cell sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors. Notably, low expression of both RNF5 and HDAC coincides with a favorable prognosis. Our studies identify an ERAD-independent role for RNF5, demonstrating that its control of RBBP4 constitutes an epigenetic pathway that drives AML, and highlight RNF5/RBBP4 as markers useful to stratify patients for treatment with HDAC inhibitors.",['(c) 2021.

To define the underlying networks, we here perform a multi-platform molecular characterization. We identify major subgroups characterized by genomic instability (GI) or activation of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-like programs, which subdivide into non-inflammatory and inflammatory subtypes. GI CLL exhibit disruption of genome integrity, DNA-damage response and are associated with mutagenesis mediated through activation-induced cytidine deaminase or defective mismatch repair. TP53 wild-type and mutated/deleted cases constitute a transcriptionally uniform entity in GI CLL and show similarly poor progression-free survival at relapse. EMT-like CLL exhibit high genomic stability, reduced benefit from the addition of rituximab and EMT-like differentiation is inhibited by induction of DNA damage. This work extends the perspective on CLL biology and risk categories in TP53 wild-type CLL. Furthermore, molecular targets identified within each subgroup provide opportunities for new treatment approaches.",['(c) 2021.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor gilteritinib is approved for the treatment of relapse/refractory AML with FLT3 mutations, yet its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Here, we sought to identify additional therapeutic targets that can be exploited to enhance gilteritinib's antileukemic effect. Based on unbiased transcriptomic analyses, we identified the glutamine transporter SNAT1 (SLC38A1) as a novel target of gilteritinib that leads to impaired glutamine uptake and utilization within leukemic cells. Using metabolomics and metabolic flux analyses, we found that gilteritinib decreased glutamine metabolism through the TCA cycle and cellular levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. In addition, gilteritinib treatment was associated with decreased ATP production and glutathione synthesis and increased reactive oxygen species, resulting in cellular senescence. Finally, we found that the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 enhanced antileukemic effect of gilteritinib in ex vivo studies using human primary FLT3-ITD-positive AML cells harboring mutations in the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, producing alpha-ketoglutarate. Collectively, this work has identified a previously unrecognized, gilteritinib-sensitive metabolic pathway downstream of SLC38A1 that causes decreased glutaminolysis and disruption of redox homeostasis. These findings provide a rationale for the development and therapeutic exploration of targeted combinatorial treatment strategies for this subset of relapse/refractory AML.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Zavorka Thomas, Megan E', 'Lu, Xiyuan', 'Talebi, Zahra', 'Jeon, Jae Yoon', 'Buelow, Daelynn R', 'Gibson, Alice A', 'Uddin, Muhammad Erfan', 'Brinton, Lindsey T', 'Nguyen, Julie', 'Collins, Meghan', 'Lodi, Alessia', 'Sweeney, Shannon R', 'Campbell, Moray J', 'Sweet, Douglas H', 'Sparreboom, Alex', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Tiziani, Stefano', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Zavorka Thomas ME', 'Lu X', 'Talebi Z', 'Jeon JY', 'Buelow DR', 'Gibson AA', 'Uddin ME', 'Brinton LT', 'Nguyen J', 'Collins M', 'Lodi A', 'Sweeney SR', 'Campbell MJ', 'Sweet DH', 'Sparreboom A', 'Lapalombella R', 'Tiziani S', 'Baker SD']","['Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences and Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences and Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences and Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences and Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences and Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. baker.2480@osu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210913,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,,,2021/09/15 06:00,2021/09/15 06:00,['2021/09/14 05:55'],"['2021/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/14 05:55 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-21-0071 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0071 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Nov;20(11):2207-2217. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0071.

Its molecular mechanism remains enigmatic. High-resolution chromosome-conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments on ex vivo mTECs revealed Aire to have a widespread impact on higher-order chromatin structure, disfavoring architectural loops while favoring transcriptional loops. In the presence of Aire, cohesin complexes concentrated on superenhancers together with mediator complexes, while the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) was relatively depleted from structural domain boundaries. In particular, Aire associated with the cohesin loader, NIPBL, strengthening this factor's affiliation with cohesin's enzymatic subunits. mTEC transcripts up-regulated in the presence of Aire corresponded closely to those down-regulated in the absence of one of the cohesin subunits, SA-2.

Although these have been considered nonfunctional for decades, a growing number of pseudogenes have been found to be transcribed and to play crucial regulatory roles. Accumulating evidence indicates that they regulate gene expression through molecular interactions at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. However, pseudogenes are often excluded in multiple genomewide analyses and functional screening, and their biological activities remain to be systematically disclosed. Here, we summarize the features of and progress of research on pseudogenes, in addition to discussing what is unknown about these genetic elements. Our previous findings, together with evidence of their poor conservation, prompted us to propose that pseudogenes may contribute to primate- or human-specific regulation, especially in hematopoiesis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

As only a minority of MDS patients are eligible for curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatment options. Chronic activation of Wnt/beta-catenin has been implicated to underlie MDS formation and recently assigned to drive MDS transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling therefore may harbor a pharmaceutical target to treat MDS and/or prevent leukemia formation. However, targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway will also affect healthy hematopoiesis in MDS patients. The control of Wnt/beta-catenin in healthy hematopoiesis is poorly understood. Whereas Wnt/beta-catenin is dispensable for steady-state erythropoiesis, its activity is essential for stress erythropoiesis in response to BM injury and anemia. Manipulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in MDS may therefore deregulate stress erythropoiesis and even increase anemia severity. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the most recent and established insights in the field to acquire more insight into the control of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in healthy and inefficient erythropoiesis as seen in MDS.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Krimpenfort, Rosa A', 'Nethe, Micha']","['Krimpenfort RA', 'Nethe M']","['Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/09/14 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/09/13 17:31'],"['2021/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/13 17:31 [entrez]']","['S2473-9529(21)00541-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004845 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Sep 28;5(18):3726-3735. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004845.,20211101,,"['Erythropoiesis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway']",18,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7563-269X'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the co-mutation of DNMT3A (DNMT3Amut) has been suggested to negatively influence the prognosis of AML-NPM1, we analyzed DNMT3Amut impact in FLT3-ITD subsets (absent, low and high ratio). A total of 164 patients diagnosed with AML-NPM1 who received intensive chemotherapy according to two consecutive protocols (AML-03 and AML-12) were selected: 76 harboring FLT3-ITD (46%), 79 DNMT3Amut (48%), and 39 (24%) showing both mutations. Overall, DNMT3A mutational status did not show prognostic impact with comparable OS (mut vs. wt 62+/-6% vs. 56+/-6%; p=0.2), RR (22+/-11% vs. 31+/-11%; p=0.2) and LFS (65+/-6 vs. 54+/-6, p=0.1). Prognostic stratification established by FLT3-ITD (FLT3wt= FLT3low> FLT3high) was independent of DNMT3A mutational status. Measurable residual disease (MRD) based on NPM1 quantitative-PCR kinetics was available in 94 patients. DNMT3Amut was associated with a higher number of mutated NPM1 transcripts following induction (p=0.012) and first consolidation (C1; p<0.001). All DNMT3Amut patients were MRD positive following C1 (p<0.001) and exhibit significant MRD persistence after second and third consolidations (MRD positive vs. negative p=0.027 and p=0.001). Finally, DNMT3Amut patients presented a trend to greater risk of molecular relapse (p=0.054). When molecular failure was proven, patients underwent an allogeneic transplant. In conclusion, DNMT3Amut did not modify overall prognosis exerted by FLT3-ITD in AML-NPM1 despite delayed MRD clearance, possibly due to MRD-driven pre-emptive intervention.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Onate, Guadalupe', 'Bataller, Alex', 'Garrido, Ana', 'Hoyos, Montserrat', 'Arnan, Montserrat', 'Vives, Susana', 'Coll, Rosa', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Sampol, Maria Antonia', 'Escoda, Lourdes', 'Salamero, Olga', 'Garcia, Antoni', 'Bargay, Joan', 'Aljarilla, Alba', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Pratcorona, Marta']","['Onate G', 'Bataller A', 'Garrido A', 'Hoyos M', 'Arnan M', 'Vives S', 'Coll R', 'Tormo M', 'Sampol MA', 'Escoda L', 'Salamero O', 'Garcia A', 'Bargay J', 'Aljarilla A', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Esteve J', 'Sierra J', 'Pratcorona M']","['Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Catalan Institute of Oncology.', 'ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Haematological Services, ICO GIRONA, Girona, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitary.

However, approximately 40% of patients cannot undergo HSCT in their first complete remission (CR1) because of chemotherapy-related toxicities and relapse before HSCT, and older age. We evaluated dasatinib-based two-step induction with the primary endpoint of 3-year event-free survival (EFS) in this study. The first induction (IND1) was dasatinib plus prednisolone to achieve CR and the second (IND2) was dasatinib plus intensive chemotherapy to achieve minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity. Patients who achieved CR and had an appropriate donor were recommended to undergo HSCT during a consolidation phase later than the first consolidation, which included high-dose methotrexate. Prophylactic dasatinib after HSCT was assigned to patients with positive pre-transplant MRD. All 78 eligible patients achieved CR or incomplete CR after IND1, and 52.6% achieved MRD-negativity after IND2. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was not reported. T315I mutation was detected in all 4 hematological relapses before HSCT. Fifty-eight (74.4%) patients underwent HSCT in CR1 and 44 (75.9%) were negative with pre-transplant MRD. At a median follow-up of 4.0 years, the 3-year EFS and overall survival were 66.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.4-75.5) and 80.5% (95% CI, 69.7-87.7), respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse and NRM at 3 years from enrollment were 26.1% and 7.8%, respectively. Dasatinib-based two-step induction was demonstrated to improve the 3-year EFS.

Chemoresistance blunts the therapeutic effect of chemotherapeutics in AML. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in chemotherapy resistance in AML. Transcriptome sequencing in the current study was applied to clarify the differentially expressed lncRNAs between peripheral blood mononuclear cells of AML and normal samples. The expression of special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 antisense RNA 1 (SATB1-AS1) and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2) in AML patients was evaluated by qRT-PCR. The relationships among SATB1-AS1, microRNA-580 (miR-580) and OAS2 were investigated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. We observed that SATB1-AS1 and OAS2 were upregulated, while miR-580 was downregulated in AML patients. SATB1-AS1 depletion suppressed proliferation, and enhanced apoptosis and sensitivity of AML cells. Additionally, SATB1-AS1 promoted the expression of OAS2 by acting as a molecular sponge of miR-580 in AML. miR-580 downregulation, OAS2 overexpression and a selective glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta inhibitor AR-A014418 abolished the effects of SATB1-AS1 deletion on the chemosensitivity of AML cells. In conclusion, SATB1-AS1 knockdown promotes the sensitivity of AML cells by upregulating miR-580 and downregulating OAS2 through the GSK3beta/beta-catenin pathway, providing new insights into the function of SATB1-AS1 as a miRNA sponge in AML.",,"['Zhou, Hong', 'Jia, Xiaofeng', 'Yang, Fan', 'Shi, Pengfei']","['Zhou H', 'Jia X', 'Yang F', 'Shi P']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.R.

However, the hierarchy or cascade of impact of these cues remains elusive due to their spatiotemporal complexity. Here, anisotropic silk protein nanofiber-based hydrogels with suitable cell adhesion capacity are developed to mimic the physical microenvironment inside the blastocele. The hydrogels enable mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to maintain stemness in vitro in the absence of both leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), two critical factors in the standard protocol for mESC maintenance. The mESCs on hydrogels can achieve superior pluripotency, genetic stability, developmental capacity, and germline transmission to those cultured with the standard protocol. Such biomaterials establish an improved dynamic niche through stimulating the secretion of autocrine factors and are sufficient to maintain the pluripotency and propagation of ESCs. The mESCs on hydrogels are distinct in their expression profiles and more resemble ESCs in vivo. The physical cues can thus initiate a self-sustaining stemness-maintaining program.

Hot homogenization method was used to prepare SC-loaded NLC-RGD. Then, size, drug encapsulation, and morphology of prepared nanoparticles were studied by photon correlation spectroscopy technic, ultrafiltration method, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Subsequently, the influence of SC-loaded NLC-RGD on endometrial receptivity was evaluated by in vitro implantation assay. Finally, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and integrin beta 3 (as endometrial receptivity markers) was assessed in SC-loaded NLC-RGD-treated endometrial cells by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Particles with a nano-size diameter (92.7 nm), appropriate polydispersity index (0.21), spherical morphology, and acceptable loading efficiency were prepared. In vitro implantation assay showed that SC, SC-loaded NLC, and SC-loaded NLC-RGD improve the rate of endometrial attachment potential by 1.6 +/- 0.4, 1.7 +/- 0.3, and 2.3 +/- 0.3 times, respectively. Analysis of RT-PCR results showed the enhancing mRNA of LIF and VEGF in SC-treated endometrial cells. Results also confirmed the higher influence of SC-loaded NLC-RGD on gene expression patterns in comparison to SC. Using NLC-RGD as a carrier to deliver SC to endometrial cells is an effective approach to improve endometrial receptivity. Upregulation of LIF and VEGF is the probable mechanism by which SC enhances the endometrial receptivity potential.","['(c) 2021.

Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the clinical importance of miR-126 and miR-122 expression in concert to imatinib response in CML patients. METHODS: The present study included 100 CML and 100 healthy subjects. The expression of the 2 miRNAs was performed using TaqMan probe chemistry, and snU6 was used as internal control. RESULTS: The expression of miR-126 and miR-122 was downregulated in CML patients, with a mean fold change +/- SD 0.20 +/- 0.33 and 0.22 +/- 0.37, respectively. While the expression of both miRNAs was analysed before and after imatinib treatment, it was observed that the expression levels of both were increased after imatinib treatment by 26.25-fold (5.33 against 0.20) and 13.95-fold (3.07 against 0.22) and the increase was statistically significant (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). The expression of miR-126 was not conclusive when compared in different clinical stages of the CML disease as it showed a decreased expression in patients with accelerated phase compared to chronic phase (mean fold change = 0.03 and 0.27, respectively), but patients with chronic phase and blastic phase had comparable expression (mean fold change = 0.27 and 0.24, respectively). We also observed an increased expression of both miRNAs after imatinib therapy in each clinical phase. CONCLUSION: The study concludes that expression of miR-126 and miR-122 increases after imatinib treatment in CML patients and that miR-126 defines the good responders of imatinib therapy.","['(c) 2021 S.

Later, she complained progressive burning leg pain, weakening of the right hand and leg muscles, associated with absence of osteotendinous leg reflexes. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a meningeal relapse of AML. Moreover, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 2 right meningeal implants of myeloid sarcoma and bone marrow revealed haematologic relapse of disease. She was treated with medicated lumbar punctures (LPs) followed by an FLA-Ida scheme, and she achieved a 2nd CR. Unfortunately, the patient developed hyperleucocytosis and reappearance of meningeal myeloid sarcoma at MRI. For this reason, a monotherapy with gilteritinib (an FLT3 inhibitor) was started: after 3 months of therapy, central nervous system (CNS)-disease shrunken and then faded, while AML in the bone marrow achieved only a partial response. This is the 1st report of a positive biological effect of gilteritinib on CNS (meningeal) myeloid sarcoma. There are no studies of gilteritinib concentration into CSF and penetration of gilteritinib into the blood-brain barrier should be further studied, given the paucity of drugs active on CNS relapse of AML. In patients receiving CPX-351 only, diagnostic LP should be considered after induction.","['(c) 2021 S.

Patients with KS present with mutation in the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) gene. Although various KMT2D mutations are often identified in lymphoma and leukemia, those encountered in aplastic anemia (AA) are limited. Herein, we present the case of a 45-year-old Japanese man who developed severe pancytopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. He did not present with any evident malformations, intellectual disability, or detectable levels of autoantibodies. However, B-cell development was impaired. Therefore, a diagnosis of very severe AA due to a hypoplastic marrow, which did not respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, was made. The patient received umbilical cord blood transplantation but died from a Pseudomonas infection before neutrophil engraftment. Trio whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel missense heterozygous mutation c.15959G >A (p.R5320H) in exon 50 of the KMT2D gene. Moreover, Sanger sequencing of peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells and a skin biopsy specimen obtained from this patient identified this heterozygous mutation, suggesting that de novo mutation associated with KS occurred in the early embryonic development. Our case showed a novel association between KS mutation and adult-onset AA.","['(c) 2021 S.

There is a need for further characterization of these cases in order to inform risk stratification and management. The importance of JAK2 mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) as a whole is well established, although their role specifically in eosinophilic disorders is less clear, with only a minority of cases demonstrating JAK2 abnormalities. Here, we report 2 cases with an exon 13 insertion-deletion (indel) mutation in JAK2: one with CEL-NOS and the second with an unspecified eosinophilic disorder. JAK2 indels were not detected in a screen of suspected MPN cases (n = 592) without eosinophilia that tested negative for common MPN driver mutations. Our findings thus provide further evidence for a specific association between this rare mutation and clonal eosinophilic disorders.","['(c) 2021 S.

A report of the chronic malignancies working party of the EBMT.,417-428,10.1111/bjh.17817 [doi],"Allogeneic haematopoietic-cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative therapy for high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is usually associated with lower non-relapse mortality (NRM), higher relapse rate and similar overall-survival (OS) as myeloablative-conditioning (MAC). Fludarabine/treosulfan (FT) is a reduced-toxicity regimen with intense anti-leukaemia activity and a favourable toxicity profile. We investigated post-transplant outcomes in 1722 MDS patients following allo-HCT with FT (n = 367), RIC (n = 687) or MAC (n = 668). FT and RIC recipients were older than MAC recipients, median age 59, 59 and 51 years, respectively (P < 0.001) but other disease characteristics were similar. The median follow-up was 64 months (1-171). Five-year relapse rates were 25% (21-30), 38% (34-42) and 25% (22-29), after FT, RIC and MAC, respectively, (P < 0.001). NRM was 30% (25-35), 27% (23-30) and 34% (31-38, P = 0.008), respectively. Five-year OS was 50% (44-55), 43% (38-47), and 43% (39-47), respectively (P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, FT was associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR 0.55, P < 0.001) and better OS (HR 0.72, P = 0.01). MAC was associated with higher NRM (HR 1.44, P = 0.001). In conclusion, FT is associated with similar low relapse rates as MAC and similar low NRM as RIC, resulting in improved OS.

Few prognostic markers have been identified: NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 (N/F) mutations identify good prognosis T-LL and high-level minimal disseminated disease (MDD) is reported to be of poor prognosis. We evaluated MDD and/or MRD status by 8-color flow cytometry and/or digital droplet PCR in 82 pediatric T-LL treated according to the EURO-LB02 prednisone reference arm. Both techniques gave identical results for values >/=0.1%, allowing compilation. Unlike historical studies, an MDD threshold of 1% had no prognostic significance. The 54% (42/78) of patients with MDD >/=0.1% had a relatively favorable outcome (5-y overall survival [OS] 97.6% versus 80.6%, P = 0.015, 5-y event-free-survival [EFS] 95.2% versus 80.6%, P = 0.049). MDD lower than 0.1% had no impact in N/F mutated T-LL, but identified the N/F germline patient with a high risk of relapse. Combining oncogenetic and MDD status identified 86% of patients (n = 49) with an excellent outcome and 14% of N/F germline/MDD <0.1% patients (n = 8) with poor prognosis (5y-OS 95.9% versus 37.5%, P < 0.001; 5y-EFS 93.9% versus 37.5%, P < 0.001).

Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases was conducted to identify articles published between January 2000 and February 2020 that implemented magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain structure and function in pediatric ALL survivors (diagnosed younger than 21 years of age). The review included articles that were published on children diagnosed with ALL between 0 and 21 years of age and treated with chemotherapy-only protocols. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria described survivors on average of 5 years or more from diagnosis and were peer-reviewed articles and original studies. Results: The search yielded 1975 articles with 23 articles meeting inclusion criteria. The review revealed that survivors had statistically significant alterations in brain anatomy, most commonly a smaller hippocampus and impaired microstructural white matter integrity in frontal brain regions. Survivors also had impaired brain function including lower brain network efficiency and altered resting state connectivity. Survivors also displayed widespread reductions in brain activation (ie, frontal, temporal, parietal brain regions) during cognitive tasks. Conclusion: Although the neurotoxic effects of cancer treatment are reduced in the absence of cranial radiation, survivors treated on chemotherapy-only protocols still display long-term alterations in brain structure and function, which contribute to lifelong neurocognitive late effects.",['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Because it can lead to life-threatening conditions, it needs to be managed carefully. Case summary: A 68-year-old woman, who was treated for acute myeloid leukaemia (subtype: M0-FAB) approximately 1 year before presentation, visited the hospital with complaints of a headache and lumbar pain. After hospitalization, investigations revealed miliary tuberculosis. On the same day, she developed a Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) with cardiac tamponade; during the course of the previous leukaemia treatment, a small ulcerative lesion at the distal aortic arch grew into a small saccular aortic aneurysm (SAA) that expanded rapidly and finally developed into a Stanford type A AAD. However, the relationship between the SAA and aortic dissection could not be confirmed. Discussion: The chronological changes in the atherosclerotic lesion at the distal aortic arch could be clearly observed because computed tomography scans were repeatedly obtained until just before the onset of AAD. The rapid progression of atherosclerotic lesions in the unique context of leukaemia treatment and miliary tuberculosis was considered to be a pathological characteristic, and the mechanism underlying this process was investigated. Clinicians should be aware of the aortic complications that may progress under special circumstances, such as anthracycline use or immunodeficiency. Careful observation is mandatory for patients with aortic disease.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

As phase-separated molecular condensates, PML NBs exhibit liquid droplet-like consistency. A key organizer of the assembly and dynamics of PML NBs is the ubiquitin-like SUMO modification system. SUMO is covalently attached to PML and other core components of PML NBs thereby exhibiting a glue-like function by providing multivalent interactions with proteins containing SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs). PML NBs serve as the catalytic center for nuclear SUMOylation and SUMO-SIM interactions are essential for protein assembly within these structures. Importantly, however, formation of SUMO chains on PML and other PML NB-associated proteins triggers ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation which coincide with disruption of these nuclear condensates. To date, a plethora of nuclear activities such as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, apoptosis, senescence, cell cycle control, DNA damage response, and DNA replication have been associated with PML NBs. Not surprisingly, therefore, SUMO-dependent PML NB integrity has been implicated in regulating many physiological processes including tumor suppression, metabolism, drug-resistance, development, cellular stemness, and anti-pathogen immune response. The interplay between PML NBs and viral infection is multifaceted. As a part of the cellular antiviral defense strategy, PML NB components are crucial restriction factors for many viruses and a mutual positive correlation has been found to exist between PML NBs and the interferon response. Viruses, in turn, have developed counterstrategies for disarming PML NB associated immune defense measures. On the other end of the spectrum, certain viruses are known to usurp specific PML NB components for successful replication and disruption of these sub-nuclear foci has recently been linked to the stimulation rather than curtailment of antiviral gene repertoire. Importantly, the ability of invading virions to manipulate the host SUMO modification machinery is essential for this interplay between PML NB integrity and viruses. Moreover, compelling evidence is emerging in favor of bacterial pathogens to negotiate with the SUMO system thereby modulating PML NB-directed intrinsic and innate immunity. In the current context, we will present an updated account of the dynamic intricacies between cellular PML NBs as the nuclear SUMO modification hotspots and immune regulatory mechanisms in response to viral and bacterial pathogens.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Patra and Muller.'],"['Patra, Upayan', 'Muller, Stefan']","['Patra U', 'Muller S']","['Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210827,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['bacteria', 'intrinsic and innate immune response', 'promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies', 'small ubiquitin-related modifier', 'viruses']",2021/09/14 06:00,2021/09/14 06:01,['2021/09/13 06:56'],"['2021/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/13 06:56 [entrez]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.696234 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Aug 27;9:696234. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.696234. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8430037,,,,,,,,,,

However, among the available treatments for malignant hematologic diseases, low detection rates and high recurrence rates are major problems in the treatment process. The quantitative detection of hematologic malignancies-related biomarkers is the key to refine the pathological typing of the disease to implement targeted therapy and thus improve the prognosis. In recent years, bioelectrochemical methods for tumor cell and blood detection have attracted the attention of an increasing number of scientists. The development of biosensor technology, nanotechnology, probe technology, and lab-on-a-chip technology has greatly facilitated the development of bioelectrochemical studies of cells, especially for blood and cell-based assays and drug resistance differentiation. To improve the sensitivity of detection, graphene is often used in the design of electrochemical sensors.

Here we describe three families in which two or more siblings were affected by CLL. We investigated whether there are immunogenetic similarities in the leukemia-specific immunoglobulin heavy (IGH) and light (IGL/IGK) chain gene rearrangements of the siblings in each family. Furthermore, we performed array analysis to study if similarities in CLL-associated chromosomal aberrations are present within each family and screened for somatic mutations using paired tumor/normal whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In two families a consistent IGHV gene mutational status (one IGHV-unmutated, one IGHV-mutated) was observed. Intriguingly, the third family with four affected siblings was characterized by usage of the lambda IGLV3-21 gene, with the hallmark R110 mutation of the recently described clinically aggressive IGLV3-21(R110) subset. In this family, the CLL-specific rearrangements in two siblings could be assigned to either stereotyped subset #2 or the immunogenetically related subset #169, both of which belong to the broader IGLV3-21(R110) subgroup. Consistent patterns of cytogenetic aberrations were encountered in all three families. Furthermore, the CLL clones carried somatic mutations previously associated with IGHV mutational status, cytogenetic aberrations and stereotyped subsets, respectively. From these findings, we conclude that similarities in immunogenetic characteristics in familial CLL, in combination with genetic aberrations acquired, point towards shared underlying mechanisms behind CLL development within each family.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kolijn, Muggen, Ljungstrom, Agathangelidis, Wolvers-Tettero,', 'Beverloo, Pal, Hengeveld, Darzentas, Hendriks, Dongen, Rosenquist and Langerak.']","['Kolijn, P Martijn', 'Muggen, Alice F', 'Ljungstrom, Viktor', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Wolvers-Tettero, Ingrid L M', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Pal, Karol', 'Hengeveld, Paul J', 'Darzentas, Nikos', 'Hendriks, Rudi W', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Langerak, Anton W']","['Kolijn PM', 'Muggen AF', 'Ljungstrom V', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Wolvers-Tettero ILM', 'Beverloo HB', 'Pal K', 'Hengeveld PJ', 'Darzentas N', 'Hendriks RW', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Rosenquist R', 'Langerak AW']","['Laboratory Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Laboratory Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, School of Science, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'CEITEC - Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.', 'Laboratory Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, LUMC, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Sweden.', 'Laboratory Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210826,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR stereotypy', 'CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia)', 'CLL development', 'Familial CLL', 'IGLV3-21 R110']",2021/09/14 06:00,2021/09/14 06:01,['2021/09/13 06:55'],"['2021/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/13 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.740083 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 26;11:740083. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.740083. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8427434,,,,,,,,,,

The most common adverse effect is pulmonary toxicity including idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). As centers adopt more advanced treatment planning techniques for TBI, total marrow irradiation (TMI), or total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) there is a greater need to understand treatment-related risks for IPS for patients treated with conventional TBI. However, definitions of IPS as well as risk factors for IPS remain poorly characterized. In this study, we perform a critical review to further evaluate the literature describing pulmonary outcomes after TBI. Materials and Methods: A search of publications from 1960-2020 was undertaken in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Search terms included ""total body irradiation"", ""whole body radiation"", ""radiation pneumonias"", ""interstitial pneumonia"", and ""bone marrow transplantation"". Demographic and treatment-related data was abstracted and evidence quality supporting risk factors for pulmonary toxicity was evaluated. Results: Of an initial 119,686 publications, 118 met inclusion criteria. Forty-six (39%) studies included a definition for pulmonary toxicity. A grading scale was provided in 20 studies (17%). In 42% of studies the lungs were shielded to a set mean dose of 800cGy. Fourteen (12%) reported toxicity outcomes by patient age. Reported pulmonary toxicity ranged from 0-71% of patients treated with TBI, and IPS ranged from 1-60%. The most common risk factors for IPS were receipt of a TBI containing regimen, increasing dose rate, and lack of pulmonary shielding. Four studies found an increasing risk of pulmonary toxicity with increasing age. Conclusions: Definitions of IPS as well as demographic and treatment-related risk factors remain poorly characterized in the literature. We recommend routine adoption of the diagnostic workup and the definition of IPS proposed by the American Thoracic Society. Additional study is required to determine differences in clinical and treatment-related risk between pediatric and adult patients. Further study using 3D treatment planning is warranted to enhance dosimetric precision and correlation of dose volume histograms with toxicities.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Vogel, Hui, Hua, Dusenbery, Rassiah, Kalapurakal, Constine and', 'Esiashvili.']","['Vogel, Jennifer', 'Hui, Susanta', 'Hua, Chia-Ho', 'Dusenbery, Kathryn', 'Rassiah, Premavarthy', 'Kalapurakal, John', 'Constine, Louis', 'Esiashvili, Natia']","['Vogel J', 'Hui S', 'Hua CH', 'Dusenbery K', 'Rassiah P', 'Kalapurakal J', 'Constine L', 'Esiashvili N']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Bon Secours Merch Health St. Francis Cancer Center, Greenville, SC, United States.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', ""Department of Radiation Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210826,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'pulmonary toxicity', 'radiation pneumonitis', 'total body irradiation', 'total body irradiation complications']",2021/09/14 06:00,2021/09/14 06:01,['2021/09/13 06:55'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/13 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.708906 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 26;11:708906. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.708906. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,['R01 CA154491/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC8428368,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identified a novel PAX5 fusion transcript in a Ph-positive mixed phenotype acute leukemia case with dic(7;9)(q13;q13), in which a translocation juxtaposes the 5' region of PAX5 and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2D4 (UBE2D4) to generate a PAX5-UBE2D4 fusion gene. To further explore the general characteristics and function of PAX5-UBE2D4, we cloned the full-length cDNA, which was amplified from the bone marrow of the patient. Interestingly, the fusion was located in the nucleus and negatively affected PAX5 transcription activity. Importantly, the fusion promoted tumor growth in nude mice and the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells in vitro. In conclusion, the fusion resulted in partial oncogenic activity, in contrast to the tumor suppressor activity of wild-type PAX5.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Yu, Zeng, Xie, Lu, Cai, Zhang, Pan, Zhao, Sun, Qiu and Chen.']","['Yu, Yan', 'Zeng, Zhao', 'Xie, Jundan', 'Lu, Qiongyu', 'Cai, Wenzhi', 'Zhang, Ruixi', 'Pan, Jinlan', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Sun, Aining', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Chen, Suning']","['Yu Y', 'Zeng Z', 'Xie J', 'Lu Q', 'Cai W', 'Zhang R', 'Pan J', 'Zhao Y', 'Sun A', 'Qiu H', 'Chen S']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210826,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL', 'MPAL', 'Pax5', 'UBE2D4', 'dic(7;9)']",2021/09/14 06:00,2021/09/14 06:01,['2021/09/13 06:55'],"['2021/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/13 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.703612 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 26;11:703612. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.703612. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8427297,,,,,,,,,,

But refractory and relapsed B-ALL still has aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis. Especially, the patients with central nervous system infiltration is very difficult to achieve complete remissions with routine treatment. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell therapy targeting CD-19 has shown to be a beneficial treatment approach in refractory and relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). However, there are very few studies reporting to treatment of refractory and relapsed B cell ALL with central nervous system infiltration. Here, we reported one single case of a patient diagnosed with relapsed B cell ALL with CNS infiltration who was successfully treated by second generation CAR containing a co-stimulator CD28 or 4-1BB therapy. Long-term proliferation of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow was observed more than 18 months. After CAR-T treatment, the patient got toxicity of grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and achieved significantly 36 months event free survival of follow-up. It is suggested that CD-19 CAR containing CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory may be an effective therapy in refractory and relapsed B cell ALL with central nervous system infiltration. Its toxicity is mild, and its safety is high.

However, due to the intrinsic characteristics of the mutation, existence of co-occurring mutations and diversified gene expression signature, the prognosis of these patients needs to be analyzed in a more systematic way. In this study we evaluated the genetic characteristics and clinical outcome in a cohort of 137 biCEBPA AML cases, and proposed a prognostic nomogram to predict the overall survival (OS) of based on the clinical variables selected by multivariate Cox regression model in training cohort, including age, white blood cell count, co-existence of DNMT3A and CSF3R mutation and whether patients could achieve complete remission after induction therapy.

Unfortunately, its aerosolized formulation has been approved only in children, and the oral formulation is not frequently used to treat the infection. However, ribavirin has demonstrated morbidity and mortality benefit in immunocompromised patients. A 70-year-old female had started chemotherapy for a diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). She developed an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) along with positive RSV status. We started her on oral ribavirin therapy, which had to be stopped after five days of treatment due to an acute hemolytic reaction. She was re-initiated on oral ribavirin after cessation of medication for seven days and showed improvement.

Establishing clonality of the eosinophils is crucial and considered the determining factor for establishing a diagnosis. Cases of hypereosinophilia without clear reactive etiologies, no evidence of end-organ damage, normal cytogenetics, and no molecular mutations are termed as ""Idiopathic Hypereosinophilia (IHE).""

Here, we report two cases of hypereosinophilia in which five possible novel molecular mutations were identified by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. They were FBXW7, KM2A, TCF3, ERBB4, and MET. With multiple genetic mutations, these cases could be classified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Both these young patients responded well to steroid therapy. While targeted NGS is a useful tool in identifying new molecular mutation associated with hypereosinophilia, our cases raise the question of further investigating this entity and if there is a possibility of an intermediate category lying between the spectrum of CEL and IHE.

These evolved viral lines show increased fitness and virulence in their host-genotype-of-passage, but display fitness and virulence tradeoffs when infecting unfamiliar host MHC genotypes. Here, we deep sequence these viral lines in an attempt to discover the genetic basis of FVC adaptation. The principal prediction for genotype-specific adaptation is that unique mutations would rise to high frequency in viral lines adapted to each host MHC genotype. This prediction was not supported by our sequencing data as most observed high-frequency variants were present in each of our independently evolved viral lines. However, using a multi-variate approach to measure divergence between viral populations, we show that populations of replicate evolved viral lines from the same MHC congenic mouse strain were more similar to one another than to lines derived from different MHC congenic mouse strains, suggesting that MHC genotype does predictably act on viral evolution in our model. Sequence analysis also revealed rampant recombination with endogenous murine leukemia virus sequences (EnMuLVs) that are encoded within the BALB/c mouse genome. The highest frequency variants in all six lines contained a 12 bp insertion from a recombinant EnMuLV source, suggesting such recombinants were either being favored by selection or were contained in a recombinational hotspot. Interestingly, they did not reach fixation, as if they are low fitness. The amount of background mutations linked to FVC/EnMuLV variable sites indicated that FVC/EnMuLV recombinants had not reached mutation selection equilibrium and thus, that EnMuLV sequences are likely continuously introgressing into the replicating viral population.

However, the risks of PICC-related complications during chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are not fully understood. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 128 adult patients with AML who received induction therapy by way of PICC insertion between 2012 and 2019. Results The median duration of PICC insertion was 30 days. The incidence rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) was 2.4% at 30 days, and women were more likely to suffer from CRBSI than men. Local reactions at the insertion site were observed in 56 patients; however, these events did not predict CRBSI. The incidence rates of catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) were 1.6% at 30 days. Obesity put patients at an increased risk for CRT. Unexpected PICC removal occurred in 59 patients, and women were at a higher risk of catheter removal than men. Conclusion Low PICC-related complication rates, possibly associated with high rates of catheter removal, were observed during intensive chemotherapy for AML. Women and obese patients require careful monitoring of their PICC.

This association enabled a diagnostic consensus for lymphocyte-depleted CHL (LD-CHL), a previously enigmatic disease. We describe two patients with LD-CHL and primary extranodal disease. One patient was a 92-year-old female (Case #1) with a large mass that involved the uterus combined with swollen lymph nodes in the pelvic cavity. The second patient was a 76-year-old female (Case #2) with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) who initially exhibited massive bone marrow involvement without peripheral lymphadenopathies. Biopsies of these tumors from the cervix uteri and bone marrow, respectively, revealed lesions rich in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells and diminished populations of other cell populations. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that these H-RS cells expressed CD30, BOB1, and fascin, but not CD15, CD20, PAX5, or OCT2. They also expressed PD-L1, which led to our preferred diagnosis of LD-CHL in both patients. Epstein-Barr virus was associated with LD-CHL in Case #1, but not in Case #2. Both patients were deemed too frail for treatment. They died of disease at 1 (Case #1) and 15 months (Case #2) after the diagnosis.

The IBRORS-CLL study assessed the characteristics, clinical management and outcome of CLL patients receiving ibrutinib in routine clinical practice in Spain. PATIENTS: Observational, retrospective, multicenter study in CLL patients who started single-agent ibrutinib as first-line treatment or at first or second relapse between January 2016 and January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 269 patients were included (median age: 70.9 years; cardiovascular comorbidity: 55.4%, including hypertension [47.6%] and atrial fibrillation [AF] [7.1%]). Overall, 96.7% and 69% of patients underwent molecular testing for del(17p)/TP53 mutation and IGHV mutation status. High-risk genetic features included unmutated IGHV (79%) and del(17p)/TP53 mutation (first-line: 66.3%; second-line: 23.1%). Overall, 84 (31.2%) patients received ibrutinib as first-line treatment, and it was used as second- and third-line therapy in 121 (45.0%) and 64 (23.8%) patients. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached irrespective of del(17p)/TP53, or unmutated IGHV. Common grade >/=3 adverse events were infections (12.2%) and bleeding (3%). Grade >/=3 AF occurred in 1.5% of patients. CONCLUSION: This real-world study shows that single-agent ibrutinib is an effective therapy for CLL, regardless of age and high-risk molecular features, consistent with clinical trials. Additionally, single-agent ibrutinib was well tolerated, with a low rate of cardiovascular events. This study also emphasized a high molecular testing rate of del(17p)/TP53 mutation and IGHV mutation status in clinical practice according to guideline recommendations.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

In parallel, a range of burdensome, often severe and occasionally life-threatening toxicities have become frequent, including hypersensitivity, hepatotoxicity, hypertriglyceridemia, thromboembolism, pancreatitis, and osteonecrosis. This often leads to truncation of asparaginase therapy, which at least in the pediatric population has been clearly associated with a higher risk of leukemic relapse. Many of the asparaginase induced toxicities are far more common in older patients, but since their relapse rate is still unsatisfactory, the decision to discontinue asparaginase therapy should balance the risk of toxicity with continued asparaginase therapy against the risk of relapse in the individual patient. The underlying mechanisms of most of the asparaginase induced side effects are still unclear.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical data of 39 children with ALAL who were diagnosed and treated from December 2015 to December 2019. Among the 39 children, 34 received treatment. According to the diagnostic criteria for ALAL by World Health Organization and European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias, the 39 children were divided into two groups: ALAL group (n=28) and myeloid expression group (n=11). The clinical features, treatment, and prognosis were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The 34 children receiving treatment had a 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of 75%+/-9% and an overall survival rate of 88%+/-6%. The children treated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) protocol had a 3-year EFS rate of 33%+/-27%, those treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) protocol had a 3-year EFS rate of 78%+/-10%, and those who had no remission after induction with AML protocol and then received ALL protocol had a 3-year EFS rate of 100%+/-0% (P<0.05). The children with negative minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy had a significantly higher 3-year EFS rate than those with positive MRD (96%+/-4% vs 38%+/-28%, P<0.05). Positive ETV6-RUNX1 was observed in the myeloid expression group, and positive BCR-ABL1, positive MLL-r, and hyperleukocytosis (white blood cell count >/=50x10(9)/L) were observed in the ALAL group. There was no significant difference in the 3-year EFS rate between the myeloid expression and ALAL groups (100%+/-0% vs 66%+/-11%, P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ALL protocol has a better clinical effect than AML protocol in children with ALAL, and positive MRD after induction therapy suggests poor prognosis. Hyperleukocytosis and adverse genetic changes are not observed in children with myeloid expression, and such children tend to have a good prognosis, suggesting that we should be cautious to take it as ALAL in diagnosis and treatment.",,"['Gao, Hui-Qin', 'Guan, Xian-Min', 'Wen, Xian-Hao', 'Shen, Ya-Li', 'Guo, Yu-Xia', 'Dou, Ying', 'Meng, Yan', 'Yu, Jie']","['Gao HQ', 'Guan XM', 'Wen XH', 'Shen YL', 'Guo YX', 'Dou Y', 'Meng Y', 'Yu J']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders/Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders/Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders/Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders/Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders/Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders/Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders/Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders/Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.""]","['eng', 'chi']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage', 'Child', 'Diagnostic criteria', 'Prognosis']",2021/09/14 06:00,2021/09/15 06:00,['2021/09/13 05:43'],"['2021/09/13 05:43 [entrez]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1008-8830(2021)08-0835-06 [pii]', '10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2105004 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2021 Aug 15;23(8):835-840. doi: 10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2105004.,20210914,,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",8,,,,PMC8428909,,,,,,,.,,,

Mass spectrometric analysis allows us to identify large numbers of these peptides (the immunopeptidome) following affinity purification of solubilized HLA-peptide complexes. However, in recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the ""dark side"" of the immunopeptidome: unconventional peptide epitopes, including neoepitopes, which elude detection by conventional search methods because their sequences are not present in reference protein databases (DBs). Here, we establish a bioinformatics workflow to aid identification of peptides generated by noncanonical translation of mRNA or by genome variants. The workflow incorporates both standard transcriptomics software and novel computer programs to produce cell line-specific protein DBs based on three-frame translation of the transcriptome. The final protein DB also includes sequences resulting from variants determined by variant calling on the same RNA-Seq data. We then searched our experimental data against both transcriptome-based and standard DBs using PEAKS Studio (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc). Finally, further novel software helps to compare the various result sets arising for each sample, pinpoint putative genomic origins for unconventional sequences, and highlight potential neoepitopes. We applied the workflow to study the immunopeptidome of the acute myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1, using RNA-Seq and immunopeptidome data. We confidently identified over 14,000 peptides from three replicates of purified HLA peptides derived from THP-1 cells using the conventional UniProt human proteome. Using the transcriptome-based DB generated using our workflow, we recapitulated >85% of these and also identified 1029 unconventional peptides not explained by UniProt, including 16 sequences caused by nonsynonymous variants. Our workflow, which we term ""immunopeptidogenomics,"" can provide DBs, which include pertinent unconventional sequences and allow neoepitope discovery, without becoming too large to search. Immunopeptidogenomics is a step toward unbiased search approaches that are needed to illuminate the dark side of the immunopeptidome.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mechanistically, it was confirmed that CCNA1 transcription was negatively regulated by forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), and the downregulation of FOXA2 promoted chemoresistance in AML cells. Moreover, the promoter sequence of CCNA1 has a significant H3K27me3 modification. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) enhanced H3K27me3 modification of CCNA1 promoter to inhibit CCNA1 expression, thus promoting sensitivity of AML cells to drugs.

Dopamine can also regulate the immune system through secreting kinds of cytokines. However, what role does dopamine play in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of dopamine in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cellular viability of acute myeloid leukemia U937 cells. Our results showed that dopamine enhanced the viability of U937 cells and activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in U937 cells. To further explore the mechanism of dopamine on U937 cells, we examined the expression level of dopamine receptors (DRs). We found that the mRNA expression level of DR5 in U937 cells was significantly higher than other dopamine receptors. Furthermore, we treated U937 cells with DR1/2/3/5 antagonist before dopamine, and it manifestly reversed the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the viability-enhancing effect in U937 cells induced by dopamine. Anti-IL-1beta antibody also could partly reversed the viability-enhancing effect by dopamine. We concluded that dopamine could enhance the viability of U937 cells through DR1/5 receptor pathway and activate NLRP3 inflammasome.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

We studied cancer incidence in AYA living with HIV in South Africa between 2004 and 2014. METHODS: In this nationwide cohort study, we included individuals between 15 and 24 years old who had at least two HIV-related laboratory measurements on separate days between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2014, recorded in the National Health Laboratory Service database. We used privacy-preserving probabilistic record linkage methods to identify HIV-related laboratory records that most likely belonged to the same individual and to then link these individuals to cancer diagnoses from the National Cancer Registry. We computed incidence rates for the most common cancers in AYA living with HIV, and we assessed associations between these cancers and sex, age, calendar year, and CD4 cell count using Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). FINDINGS: We included 782 454 AYA living with HIV (698 066 [89.2%] women) with 1 428 114 person-years of follow-up. Of those, 867 developed incident cancer (incidence rate 60.7 per 100 000 person-years), including 429 who developed Kaposi sarcoma (30.0 per 100 000 person-years), 107 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (7.5 per 100 000 person-years), 48 Hodgkin lymphoma (3.4 per 100 000 person-years), 45 cervical cancer (3.4 per 100 000 woman-years), and 32 leukaemia (2.2 per 100 000 person-years). Kaposi sarcoma was more common in the 20-24 year age group than the 15-19 year age group (aHR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.86). Male sex was associated with higher rates of Kaposi sarcoma (2.06, 1.61-2.63), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.17, 2.06-4.89), Hodgkin lymphoma (4.83, 2.61-8.93), and leukaemia (unadjusted HR 5.90, 95% CI 2.87-12.12). Cancer rates decreased over the study period, driven by declining Kaposi sarcoma rates. Lower baseline CD4 cell counts were associated with higher rates of Kaposi sarcoma, cervical cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma, but not leukaemia. INTERPRETATION: Infection-related cancers were the most common cancer types in AYA living with HIV in South Africa, and their incidence rates increased with lower CD4 cell counts. Therefore, innovative strategies to maintaining high CD4 cell counts are needed to reduce the cancer burden in this vulnerable population.

It has been reported recently that ABL1 itself is required for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell migration induced by CXCL12. Further experiments revealed that ABL1 inhibitor Nilotinib inhibited leukemia cell migration induced by CXCL12, indicating the possible application of Nilotinib in T-ALL leukemia treatment. However, the interacting proteins of ABL1 and the specific mechanisms of their involvement in this process need further investigation. In the present study, ABL1 interacting proteins were characterized and their roles in the process of leukemia cell migration induced by CXCL12 were investigated. Co-immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry analysis identified 333 proteins that interact with ABL1, including Cofilin1. Gene ontology analysis revealed that many of them were enriched in the intracellular organelle or cytoplasm, including nucleic acid binding components, transfectors, or co-transfectors. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the top three enriched pathways were translation, glycan biosynthesis, and metabolism, together with human diseases. ABL1 and Cofilin1 were in the same complex. Cofilin1 binds the SH3 domain of ABL1 directly; however, ABL1 is not required for the phosphorylation of Cofilin1. Molecular docking analysis shows that ABL1 interacts with Cofilin1 mainly through hydrogen bonds and ionic interaction between amino acid residues. The mobility of leukemic cells was significantly decreased by Cofilin1 siRNA. These results demonstrate that Cofilin1 is a novel ABL1 binding partner. Furthermore, Cofilin1 participates in the migration of leukemia cells induced by CXCL12. These data indicate that ABL1 and Cofilin1 are possible targets for T-ALL treatment.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

This study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer effects of BGB-3111 combined with bortezomib (BTZ) against the BTK-expressing MCL. We found that BTK, which was overexpressed in 59.4% of patients with MCL, was mainly characterized by high Ki67 and elevated MIPI scores. BGB-3111 strongly inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest in the G1/G0-phase, and promoted cell apoptosis in the MCL cells expressing BTK. BGB-3111 provides better safety than another BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib as ibrutinib inhibits the inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) as an off-target effect but BGB-3111 does not inhibit ITK. Low doses of BTZ enhanced the anti-cancer effect induced by the low dose of BGB-3111 by downregulating the expression levels of PARP and Bcl-2 and increasing the expression levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-9. In addition, low doses of BGB-3111, but not of BTZ, inhibited BTK phosphorylation. However, low-doses of BTZ strengthened the anti-cancer effect induced by the low-doses of BGB-3111 via synergistically suppressing the IkappaBalpha and P65 phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings validate that BGB-3111 is a novel and effective BTK inhibitor for MCL-expressing BTK. Hence, it can be harnessed as a potential therapeutic strategy through a combinatorial treatment comprising low-dose BGB-3111 and low-dose BTZ to gain strong anti-cancer effects and better safety for

Interaction between LtxA and Jurkat T-cells results in cell death and is characterized by increased intracellular Ca(2+), activation of caspases, clustering of LtxA and LFA-1 within lipid rafts, and involvement of the Fas death receptor. Here, we show that LtxA can kill malignant lymphocytes via apoptotic and necrotic forms of cell death. We show that LtxA causes activation of caspases and PARP, cleavage of pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels, and expulsion of ATP, ultimately leading to cell death via apoptosis and necrosis. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout (K/O) of Panx1 in Jurkat cells prevented ATP expulsion and resulted in resistance to LtxA for both apoptotic and necrotic forms of death. Resistance to necrosis could only be overcome when supplementing LtxA with endogenous ATP (bzATP). The combination of LtxA and bzATP promoted only necrosis, as no Panx1 K/O cells stained positive for phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure following the combined treatment. Inhibition of LtxA/bzATP-induced necrosis was possible when pretreating Jurkat cells with oATP, a P2X7R antagonist. Similarly, blockage of P2X7Rs with oATP prevented the intracellular mobilization of Ca(2+), an important early step in LtxA induced cell death. We show that LtxA is able to kill malignant lymphocytes through an apoptotic death pathway which is potentially linked to a Panx1/P2X7R mediated necrotic form of death. Thus, inhibition of ATP release appears to significantly delay the onset of LtxA induced apoptosis while completely disabling the necrotic death pathway in T-lymphocytes, demonstrating the crucial role of ATP release in LtxA-mediated cell death.",['(c) 2021.

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with CML, several problems such as resistance and recurrence still exist. Immunological control may contribute to solving these problems, and it is important to understand why CML patients fail to spontaneously develop anti-tumor immunity. Here, we show that differentiation of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which are vital for anti-tumor immunity, is restricted from an early stage of hematopoiesis in CML. In addition, we found that monocytes and basophils, which are increased in CML patients, express high levels of PD-L1, an immune checkpoint molecule that inhibits T cell responses. Moreover, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that basophils express genes related to poor prognosis in CML. Our data suggest that BCR-ABL not only disrupts the ""accelerator"" (i.e., cDCs) but also applies the ""brake"" (i.e., monocytes and basophils) of anti-tumor immunity, compromising the defense against CML cells.",['(c) 2021.

RECENT FINDINGS: CAR-T targeting CD19 can induce durable remissions and prolong life in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. Whether HCT is needed to consolidate remission and cure relapse/refractory B-ALL following a CD19 CAR-T induced remission remains controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that consolidative HCT following CAR-T in HCT-naive children improves leukemia-free survival. However, avoiding HCT-related late effects is a desirable goal, so identification of patients at high risk of relapse is needed to appropriately direct those patients to HCT when necessary, while avoiding HCT in others. High disease burden prior to CAR-T infusion, loss of B-cell aplasia and detection of measurable residual disease by flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing following CAR-T therapy associate with a higher relapse risk and may identify patients requiring consolidative HCT for relapse prevention. SUMMARY: There is a pressing need to determine when CD19 CAR-T alone is likely to be curative and when a consolidative HCT will be required. We discuss the current state of knowledge and future directions.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

About 60% patients are over 60 years old. There are various treatment options for AML patients. But for elderly patients, the complete remission rates are disappointing due to genetic, molecular, and age-related factors. Development of next-generation sequencing technologies makes it possible to seek individual strategies for patients in different ages. This study analyzed transcriptome profiles in platelets of AML patients in different ages for the first time. METHODS: Platelet RNA sequencing in AML of ten elderly and seven young patients were performed with Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA library Prep Kit and Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencing instrument. With the FASTQ sequencing data obtained, statistical analyses between elderly with young AML patients were analyzed by R program. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed via R package clusterProfiler. TOP 10 down-regulated/up-regulated genes in elderly patients compared to young patients were selected with the threshold of |L2FC| > 2 and padj </= 0.0001. The down-regulated gene ATF4 was chosen by GSEA analysis and ROC analysis with AUC > 0.95. RESULTS: We found 3059 genes with differential transcript levels (GDTLs) in AML patients of different age. Among them, 2048 genes are down-regulated and 651 genes are up-regulated in elderly patients. We found that gene transcript profiles in elderly patients is obviously different from those in young patients, including a collection of down-regulated genes related to proteins processing in endoplasmic reticulum and immunity. We further identified that genes of pathway in cancer and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, involved in natural immunity and metabolism, are significantly down-regulated in elderly patients. Among all screened genes with decreased transcript levels, we believe that activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a biomarker indicating different chemotherapy strategies for elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, gene transcript profiles are different in platelets of elderly and young AML patients. And ATF4 can be a useful biomarker indicating different chemotherapy strategies for AML patients with different ages.",['(c) 2021.

We investigated how the BM microenvironment affects the response to OxPhos inhibition in AML by using a novel complex I OxPhos inhibitor, IACS-010759. Cellular adhesion, growth, and apoptosis assays, along with measurements of expression of mitochondrial DNA and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species indicated that direct interactions with BM stromal cells triggered compensatory activation of mitochondrial respiration and resistance to OxPhos inhibition in AML cells. Mechanistically, inhibition of OxPhos induced transfer of mitochondria derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to AML cells via tunneling nanotubes under direct-contact coculture conditions. Inhibition of OxPhos also induced mitochondrial fission and increased functional mitochondria and mitophagy in AML cells. Mitochondrial fission is known to enhance cell migration, so we used electron microscopy to observe mitochondrial transport to the leading edge of protrusions of AML cells migrating toward MSCs. We further demonstrated that cytarabine, a commonly used antileukemia agent, increased mitochondrial transfer of MSCs to AML cells triggered by OxPhos inhibition.

However, excess toxicity to donor lymphocytes may hamper immune reconstitution, compromising antitumor effects and increasing infection. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) administered early after HCT may increase ATG-mediated lymphotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate the effect of an interaction between ATG and post-transplantation granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on allogeneic HCT outcomes, using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry. We studied patients age >/=18 years with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who received Thymoglobulin-containing preparative regimens for HLA-matched sibling/unrelated or mismatched unrelated donor HCT between 2010 and 2018. The effect of planned G-CSF that was started between pretransplantation day 3 and post-transplantation day 12 was studied in comparison with transplantations that did not include G-CSF. Cox regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with outcomes at 1 year after transplantation. A total of 874 patients met the study eligibility criteria, of whom 459 (53%) received planned G-CSF. HCT with planned G-CSF was associated with a significantly increased risk for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03; P <.0001; 21% versus 12%) compared to HCT without G-CSF. The 6-month incidence of viral infection was higher with G-CSF (56% versus 47%; P = .007), with a particular increase in Epstein-Barr virus infections (19% versus 11%; P = .002). The observed higher NRM with planned G-CSF led to lower overall survival (HR, 1.52; P = .0005; 61% versus 72%). There was no difference in GVHD risk between the treatment groups. We performed 2 subgroup analyses showing that our findings held true in patients age >/=50 years and in centers where G-CSF was used in some, but not all, patients. In allogeneic peripheral blood HCT performed with Thymoglobulin for AML and MDS, G-CSF administered early post-transplantation resulted in a 2-fold increase in NRM and a 10% absolute decrement in survival. The use of planned G-CSF in the early post-transplantation period should be carefully considered on an individual patient basis, weighing any perceived benefits against these risks.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'All rights reserved.']","['Orfali, Nina', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Allbee-Johnson, Mariam', 'Boelens, Jaap Jan', 'Artz, Andrew S', 'Brunstein, Claudio G', 'McNiece, Ian K', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Abid, Muhammad Bilal', 'Chee, Lynette', 'Diaz, Miguel A', 'Grunwald, Michael R', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'Hsu, Jingmei', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Munshi, Pashna N', 'Prestidge, Timothy', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Riches, Marcie L', 'Seo, Sachiko', 'Solh, Melhem', 'Solomon, Scott', 'Szwajcer, David', 'Yared, Jean', 'van Besien, Koen', 'Eapen, Mary']","['Orfali N', 'Zhang MJ', 'Allbee-Johnson M', 'Boelens JJ', 'Artz AS', 'Brunstein CG', 'McNiece IK', 'Milano F', 'Abid MB', 'Chee L', 'Diaz MA', 'Grunwald MR', 'Hematti P', 'Hsu J', 'Lazarus HM', 'Munshi PN', 'Prestidge T', 'Ringden O', 'Rizzieri D', 'Riches ML', 'Seo S', 'Solh M', 'Solomon S', 'Szwajcer D', 'Yared J', 'van Besien K', 'Eapen M']","[""Haematology Department, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.

Although the bacteriophage surrogate, O6, has been used to assess low pH BSL2 VI, it has not been used for evaluation of detergent-mediated VI. Furthermore, O6 is typically assayed through host cell infectivity which introduces the risk of cross-contaminating other cell lines in the facility. To circumvent contamination, we developed an in-house RT-qPCR (Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction) assay for selective detection of active O6 from a population of live and dead phage. The RT-qPCR assay was used to evaluate O6 inactivation in cell culture fluid of monoclonal antibody and fusion protein. Complementary O6 infectivity was also conducted at a third-party testing facility. The O6 RT-qPCR and infectivity data was modeled against VI of three BSL2 viruses, X- MuLV, A- MuLV and HSV-1 in corresponding therapeutics. Both O6 methods demonstrate that any VI agent showing O6 clearance of a minimum of 2.5 logs would demonstrate complete BSL2 VI of >/= 4.0 logs. Compared to BSL2 virus testing, this in-house O6 RT-qPCR tool can screen VI agents at 5% the cost and a turnaround time of 2 to 3 days vs. 4 to 7 months.",['(c) 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.'],"['Feroz, Hasin', 'Cetnar, Daniel', 'Hewlett, Robert', 'Sharma, Satish', 'Holstein, Melissa', 'Ghose, Sanchayita', 'Li, Zheng Jian']","['Feroz H', 'Cetnar D', 'Hewlett R', 'Sharma S', 'Holstein M', 'Ghose S', 'Li ZJ']","['Biologics Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Devens, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Biologics Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Devens, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Biologics Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Devens, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Biologics Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Devens, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Biologics Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Devens, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Biologics Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Devens, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Biologics Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, Devens, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211013,Germany,Biotechnol J,Biotechnology journal,101265833,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BSL2 enveloped virus', 'RT-qPCR (Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction)', 'bacteriophage surrogate', 'detergent inactivation', 'fusion protein', 'monoclonal antibody']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/09/10 17:27'],"['2021/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/10 17:27 [entrez]']",['10.1002/biot.202100176 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol J. 2021 Dec;16(12):e2100176. doi: 10.1002/biot.202100176.

OBJECTIVE.-: To investigate the clonal relationship between the 2 genomic alterations, as well as the clinicopathologic impact. DESIGN.-: Retrospective analysis of MPNs with sequential development of BCR-ABL1 and JAK2V617F. RESULTS.-: Of 6 cases, 5 had JAK2V617F-positive MPN diagnosed before acquiring BCR-ABL1 years later, and 1 had BCR-ABL1+ chronic myeloid leukemia before JAK2V617F-positive myelofibrosis completely replaced the BCR-ABL1+ clone 1 year after tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Among the former group, treatment for the initial MPN involved hydroxyurea, ruxolitinib, and/or supportive care, and the latency to the development of JAK2V617F ranged from 4 to 13 years (median of 9 years). Four cases showed retention of JAK2V617F, whereas BCR-ABL1 emerged as the major clone, including 2 that exhibited parallel increases in JAK2V617F and BCR-ABL1 burdens, with both genomic markers exceeding 50%. Three patients received stem cell transplants and demonstrated sustained engraftment, with the genomic markers below detectable levels. CONCLUSIONS.-: Most MPNs with concomitant JAK2V617F and BCR-ABL1 are actually composite MPNs with a ""second hit"" residing on a different clone. Rare cases demonstrate a subclone harboring a ""double-hit"" in a background of a JAK2V617F-positive stem line clone. The probability of a ""double-hit"" with a BCR-ABL1+ stem line clone is probably reduced by effective tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. The treatment often involves combined kinase inhibitors and/or hydroxyurea, but the outcome is unpredictable; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be the ultimate therapeutic option for this complicated disease.",['(c) 2021 College of American Pathologists.'],"['Zhao, Yue', 'Reddi, Deepti', 'McCracken, Jenna', 'Iranzad, Natasha', 'Rehder, Cathrine', 'Neff, Jadee', 'Wang, Endi']","['Zhao Y', 'Reddi D', 'McCracken J', 'Iranzad N', 'Rehder C', 'Neff J', 'Wang E']","['From the Department of Pathology, College of Basic Medical Sciences and First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China (Zhao).', 'the Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina (Zhao, McCracken, Iranzad, Rehder, Neff, Wang).', 'the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle (Reddi).', 'the Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina (Zhao, McCracken, Iranzad, Rehder, Neff, Wang).', 'the Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina (Zhao, McCracken, Iranzad, Rehder, Neff, Wang).', 'the Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina (Zhao, McCracken, Iranzad, Rehder, Neff, Wang).', 'the Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina (Zhao, McCracken, Iranzad, Rehder, Neff, Wang).', 'the Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina (Zhao, McCracken, Iranzad, Rehder, Neff, Wang).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210910,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,,,2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:00,['2021/09/10 17:25'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['470215 [pii]', '10.5858/arpa.2021-0096-OA [doi]']",aheadofprint,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2021 Sep 10. pii: 470215. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2021-0096-OA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms of BLV-associated lymphomagenesis remain poorly understood. Here, after deep sequencing, we performed comparative analyses of B cell microRNAs (miRNAs) in cattle infected with BLV and those without BLV. In BLV-infected cattle, BLV-derived miRNAs (blv-miRNAs) accounted for 38% of all miRNAs in B cells. Four of these blv-miRNAs (blv-miR-B1-5p, blv-miR-B2-5p, blv-miR-B4-3p, and blv-miR-B5-5p) had highly significant positive correlations with BLV proviral load (PVL). The read counts of 90 host-derived miRNAs (bta-miRNAs) were significantly down-regulated in BLV-infected cattle compared to those in uninfected cattle. Only bta-miR-375 had a positive correlation with PVL in BLV-infected cattle and was highly expressed in the B cell lymphoma tissue of EBL cattle. There were a few bta-miRNAs that correlated with BLV tax/rex gene expression; however, BLV AS1 expression had a significant negative correlation with many of the down-regulated bta-miRNAs that are important for tumor development and/or tumor suppression. These results suggest that BLV promotes lymphomagenesis via AS1 and blv-miRNAs, rather than tax/rex, by down-regulating the expression of bta-miRNAs that have a tumor-suppressing function, and this downregulation is linked to increased PVL.",,"['Ochiai, Chihiro', 'Miyauchi, Sonoko', 'Kudo, Yuta', 'Naruke, Yuta', 'Yoneyama, Syuji', 'Tomita, Keisuke', 'Dongze, Leng', 'Chiba, Yusuke', 'Hirata, To-Ichi', 'Ichijo, Toshihiro', 'Nagai, Kazuya', 'Kobayashi, Sota', 'Yamada, Shinji', 'Hikono, Hirokazu', 'Murakami, Kenji']","['Ochiai C', 'Miyauchi S', 'Kudo Y', 'Naruke Y', 'Yoneyama S', 'Tomita K', 'Dongze L', 'Chiba Y', 'Hirata TI', 'Ichijo T', 'Nagai K', 'Kobayashi S', 'Yamada S', 'Hikono H', 'Murakami K']","['Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Field Science Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Shizukuishi, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Division of Bacterial and Parasitic Disease, National Institute of Animal Health, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Animal Sciences, Teikyo University of Science, Adachi, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210910,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/09/11 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/09/10 17:21'],"['2020/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 17:21 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0256588 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-35708 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Sep 10;16(9):e0256588. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0256588. eCollection 2021.,20211118,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Viral Load']",9,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],['ORCID: 0000-0003-3813-818X'],,PMC8432782,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently current risk-adapted therapeutic strategy aims to reduce long-term side effects in patients with standard risk disease. METHODS: We report long-term mortality and morbidity data concerning 151 2-year hepatoblastoma survivors treated with SIOPEL risk-adapted strategies (sex-ratio M/F = 1.6, median age at diagnosis = 2.6 years [range 0-17.7], median year at diagnosis = 2008 [1994-2017]). Fifty-three patients had loco-regional risk factors VPEFR, 12 were PRETEXT-IV and 30 were metastatic. All received cisplatin and 84 anthracyclines. Twelve had liver transplant. To assess hearing, renal and cardiac functions, audiograms were performed in 116/151 patients (76.8%), glomerular filtration rate in 113/151 (74.8%) and cardiac ultrasound in 65/84 (77.4%) anthracycline-exposed patients. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 9.4 years (range 2.1-25.8), four late relapses, one second malignancy (Acute Myeloid Leukemia AML-M5) and two deaths (one from hepatoblastoma, one from AML) occurred. The 10-years event free survival and overall survival probabilities were 95.5% (95% CI 91.9-99.1) and 98.7% (95% CI 96.8-100), respectively. Sixty-eight non-oncologic health-events included 57 cases of hearing loss (including 25 Brock 3-4), three liver cirrhosis, three pre-operative portal cavernoma, two focal nodular hyperplasia, two grade-1 chronic kidney diseases and one asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction were reported. Ototoxicity was significantly associated with cisplatin cumulative dose (OR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.32-3.24, p = 0.001) and carboplatin exposure (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.30-7.58, p = 0.01) in multivariable analysis adjusted for sex and age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: With current risk-adapted strategies, hepatoblastoma is a highly curable disease, with very rare relapses, and few late effects except hearing loss which remains a serious condition in these very young patients.",['(c) 2021.

We report a patient with a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with a BCR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase (BCR)-JAK2 fusion with initial hematologic response to ruxolitinib who rapidly developed B-lymphoid blast transformation. We analyzed pre-ruxolitinib and blast transformation samples using genome sequencing, DNA mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and chromosomal microarray to characterize possible mechanisms of resistance. No resistance mutations in the BCR-JAK2 fusion gene or transcript were identified, and fusion transcript expression levels remained stable. However, at the time of blast transformation, MPseq detected a new IKZF1 copy-number loss, which is predicted to result in loss of normal IKZF1 protein translation. RNA-seq revealed significant upregulation of genes negatively regulated by IKZF1, including IL7R and CRLF2. Disease progression was also characterized by adaptation to an activated B-cell receptor (BCR)-like signaling phenotype, with marked upregulation of genes such as CD79A, CD79B, IGLL1, VPREB1, BLNK, ZAP70, RAG1, and RAG2. In summary, IKZF1 deletion and a switch from cytokine dependence to activated BCR-like signaling phenotype represent putative mechanisms of ruxolitinib resistance in this case, recapitulating preclinical data on resistance to JAK inhibition in CRLF2-rearranged Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Chen, Justin Anthony', 'Hou, Yanli', 'Roskin, Krishna M', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Bangs, Charles D', 'Baughn, Linda B', 'Cherry, Athena M', 'Ewalt, Mark D', 'Fire, Andrew Z', 'Fresard, Laure', 'Kearney, Hutton M', 'Montgomery, Stephen B', 'Ohgami, Robert S', 'Pearce, Kathryn E', 'Pitel, Beth A', 'Merker, Jason D', 'Gotlib, Jason']","['Chen JA', 'Hou Y', 'Roskin KM', 'Arber DA', 'Bangs CD', 'Baughn LB', 'Cherry AM', 'Ewalt MD', 'Fire AZ', 'Fresard L', 'Kearney HM', 'Montgomery SB', 'Ohgami RS', 'Pearce KE', 'Pitel BA', 'Merker JD', 'Gotlib J']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA.', 'Roche Diagnostics, Santa Clara, CA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, and Division of Biomedical Informatics and Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory, Stanford Hospital and Clinics, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory, Stanford Hospital and Clinics, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, and Department of Genetics, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine and Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/09/11 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/09/10 12:12'],"['2021/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 12:12 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00522-X [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004174 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Sep 14;5(17):3492-3496. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004174.,20211101,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']","['Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders', 'Nitriles', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell']",17,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0218-1867', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5864-5093', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2160-9689', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8040-9679', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4245-752X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6217-8312', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8154-6328', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6002-6494', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5200-3903', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1881-3440', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5138-824X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0865-3394', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8253-6156']",,PMC8525236,,,,,,,,,,

In haematological malignancies, bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) protect malignant cells from drug-induced cytotoxicity. However, less is known about malignant impact on supportive stroma. Notably, it is unknown whether these interactions alter long-term genotoxic damage in either direction. The nucleoside analogue cytarabine (ara-C), common in haematological therapies, remains the most effective agent for acute myeloid leukaemia, yet one-third of patients develop resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the bidirectional effect of MSC and malignant cell co-culture on ara-C genotoxicity modulation. Primary MSC, isolated from patient BM aspirates for haematological investigations, and malignant haematopoietic cells (leukaemic HL-60) were co-cultured using trans-well inserts, prior to treatment with physiological dose ara-C. Co-culture genotoxic effects were assessed by micronucleus and alkaline comet assays. Patient BM cells from chemotherapy-treated patients had reduced ex vivo survival (P = 0.0049) and increased genotoxicity (P = 0.3172) than untreated patients. It was shown for the first time that HL-60 were protected by MSC from ara-C-induced genotoxicity, with reduced MN incidence in co-culture as compared to mono-culture (P = 0.0068). Comet tail intensity also significantly increased in ara-C-treated MSC with HL-60 influence (P = 0.0308). MSC sensitisation to ara-C genotoxicity was also demonstrated following co-culture with HL60 (P = 0.0116), which showed significantly greater sensitisation when MSC-HL-60 co-cultures were exposed to ara-C (P = 0.0409). This study shows for the first time that malignant HSC and MSC bidirectionally modulate genotoxicity, providing grounding for future research identifying mechanisms of altered genotoxicity in leukaemic microenvironments. MSC retain long-term genotoxic and functional damage following chemotherapy exposure. Understanding the interactions perpetuating such damage may inform modifications to reduce therapy-related complications, such as secondary malignancies and BM failure.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The development of such tools can add value as a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of tissue samples involved by lymphoma. A common diagnostic question is the determination of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression to accelerated CLL (aCLL) or transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter transformation; RT) in patients who develop progressive disease. The morphologic assessment of CLL, aCLL, and RT can be diagnostically challenging. Using established diagnostic criteria of CLL progression/transformation, we designed four artificial intelligence-constructed biomarkers based on cytologic (nuclear size and nuclear intensity) and architectural (cellular density and cell to nearest-neighbor distance) features. We analyzed the predictive value of implementing these biomarkers individually and then in an iterative sequential manner to distinguish tissue samples with CLL, aCLL, and RT. Our model, based on these four morphologic biomarker attributes, achieved a robust analytic accuracy.

Patients & methods: To further address this issue, we analyzed cardiovascular complications in relation to common and rare genetic variants derived through whole-exome sequencing from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors (PETALE cohort). Results: Significant associations were detected among common variants in the TTN gene, left ventricular ejection fraction (p </= 0.0005), and fractional shortening (p </= 0.001). Rare variants enrichment in the NOS1, ABCG2 and NOD2 was observed in relation to left ventricular ejection fraction, and in NOD2 and ZNF267 genes in relation to fractional shortening. Following stratification according to risk groups, the modulatory effect of rare variants was additionally found in the CBR1, ABCC5 and AKR1C3 genes.

The cell space occupied by the nucleus was constant and did not change during the cell differentiation in the lymphocytic cell lineages of BDs and CLL patients despite the decreased cell size. In contrary, the cell space occupied by the nucleus markedly decreased in differentiating cells of granulocytic and erythroid lineages of patients suffering from CML. In the erythroid cell lineage in patients with RA of MDS the small reduction of the cell space occupied by the nucleus during the differentiation was not significant. The measurements also indicated that in progenitor cells of all studied cell lineages nuclei occupied more than 70 % of the cell space.

He was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia 13 years before and was treated with imatinib. Deep molecular response was achieved but he developed 1+ proteinuria in the first year, which gradually worsened thereafter. Imatinib was discontinued 12 years later but proteinuria and kidney dysfunction were progressive. Percutaneous kidney biopsy revealed mild mesangial hyper-cellularity and matrix increase, swelling of endothelial cells, and partial double contours of glomerular tufts. Subendothelial edema in the interlobular artery was also noted. Immunofluorescence was not remarkable. Electron microscopy revealed endothelial injury with severe sub-endothelial edema. Since imatinib had already been discontinued, conservative therapy with maximal dose of azilsartan was administered. A second biopsy was performed 1 year later because of further deterioration of kidney function, which revealed markedly increased global glomerulosclerosis and severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Segmental glomerulosclerosis with podocyte hyperplasia was also observed. Electron microscopy revealed glomerulosclerotic changes and partially attenuated endothelial injury. Two and a half years later, proteinuria reduced, progression of kidney dysfunction slowed, and he was independent on dialysis therapy. Molecular response of chronic myeloid leukemia was also maintained.

Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase Acid Like 3B (SMPDL3B) is a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor signaling that plays important roles in the interface of membrane biology and innate immunity. However, the potential role of SMPDL3B in human cancer, especially in AML, is still unknown. Methods: The expression of SMPDL3B in AML samples was investigated through data collected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Association between SMPDL3B expression and clinicopathologic characteristics was analyzed with the chi-square test. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox univariate and multivariate analyses were used to detect risk factors for overall survival. The biological functions of SMPDL3B in human AML were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Results: Expression of SMPDL3B mRNA was significantly upregulated in human AML samples and closely correlated to cytogenetics risk and karyotypes. Elevated expression of SMPDL3B was associated with poor overall survival and emerged as an independent predictor for poor overall survival in human AML. Blocked SMPDL3B expression inhibited AML cells growth both in vitro and in vivo via promoting cell apoptosis. Conclusion: Taken together, our results demonstrate that SMPDL3B could be used as an efficient prognostic biomarker and represent a potential therapeutic target for human AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Qu and Zhu.'],"['Qu, Huiqing', 'Zhu, Ye']","['Qu H', 'Zhu Y']","['Department of Blood Transfusion, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.', ""Department of Internal Medicine, People's Fifth Hospital of Jinan City Affiliated to Weifang Medical University, Jinan, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210824,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,['NOTNLM'],"['SMPDL3B', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'biomarker', 'prognosis']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 07:03'],"['2021/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 07:03 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fmolb.2021.695601 [doi]', '695601 [pii]']",epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Aug 24;8:695601. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.695601. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8421532,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this observational study during April 2015 to May 2018. The most common adverse event was reversible CTCAE grade 2 thrombocytopenia (20/24). Strikingly, all 24 patients had response to this epigenetic regimen accompanied with decreased measurable residual disease. The overall survival rate is 79.2% (19/24), with a relapse-free survival rate of 79.2% (19/24). During this regimen treatment, Th1 cells and CD3+CD4-CD8+T cells increased, and Th17 cells decreased gradually. The status of high Th1 and low Th17 cells was still observed on the 3rd month after discontinuation of this regimen.

However, they are rarely used as a part of conditioning regimens in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This retrospectively study included a total of 65 patients (median, 37; range, 13-63) with relapsed or refractory AML who were treated by allo-HSCT after myeloablative conditioning regimens without or with DAC (high-dose DAC schedule, 75 mg/m(2) on day -9 and 50 mg/m(2) on day -8; low-dose DAC schedule, 25 mg/m(2)/day on day -10 to -8). DAC exerted no impact on hematopoietic reconstitution. However, patients who were treated with the high-dose DAC schedule had significantly higher incidence of overall survival (OS, 50.0%) and leukemia-free survival (LFS, 35.0%), and lower incidence of relapse (41.1%) and grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD, 10.0%) at 3 years, when compared with those treated with standard conditioning regimens or with the low-dose DAC schedule. In conclusion, high-dose DAC combined with standard conditioning regimens before allo-HSCT is feasible and efficient and might improve outcomes of patients with relapsed or refractory AML, which provides a potential approach to treat these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Cheng, Xu, Chen, Hu, Liu, Lan, Xie, Sun, Wang, Zhang, Sun,', 'Chen and Hu.']","['Li, Yuhang', 'Cheng, Longcan', 'Xu, Chen', 'Chen, Jianlin', 'Hu, Jiangwei', 'Liu, Na', 'Lan, Sanchun', 'Xie, Jing', 'Sun, Ting', 'Wang, Lei', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Sun, Yao', 'Chen, Shuiping', 'Hu, Liangding']","['Li Y', 'Cheng L', 'Xu C', 'Chen J', 'Hu J', 'Liu N', 'Lan S', 'Xie J', 'Sun T', 'Wang L', 'Zhang Y', 'Sun Y', 'Chen S', 'Hu L']","['Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210824,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'conditioning regimen', 'decitabine', 'hypomethylating agents', 'relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 07:02'],"['2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 07:02 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.702239 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 24;11:702239. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.702239. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8421765,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1), the nuclear export regulator of most proteins, has been confirmed to be over-expressed in various malignancies and is regarded as an efficient target. But the potential role of the CRM1 cofactor RanBP3 (Ran Binding Protein 3) is left unrevealed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here, we first detected the level of RanBP3 in CML and found an elevated RanBP3 expression in CML compared with control. Then we used shRNA lentivirus to down-regulated RanBP3 in imatinib sensitive K562 cells and resistant K562/G01 cells and found RanBP3 silencing inhibited cell proliferation by up-regulating p21, induced caspase3-related cell apoptosis, and enhanced the drug sensitivity of IM in vitro. Notably, we observed that RanBP3 silencing restored imatinib sensitivity of K562 cells in NOD/SCID mice. Mechanistically, the nuclear aggregation of SMAD2/3 revealed that tumor suppressor axis (TGF-beta)-SMAD2/3-p21 was the anti-proliferation program related to RanBP3 knockdown, and the decrease of cytoplasmic ERK1/2 caused by RanBP3 interference leaded to the down-regulation of anti-apoptosis protein p(Ser112)-BAD, which was the mechanism of increased cell apoptosis and enhanced chemosensitivity to imatinib in CML. In summary, this study revealed the expression and potential role of RanBP3 in CML, suggesting that targeting RanBP3 alone or combined with TKIs could improve the clinical response of CML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Huang, Peng, Wang, Jiang, Wang, Mou and Feng.']","['Li, Qian', 'Huang, Zhenglan', 'Peng, Yuhang', 'Wang, Xin', 'Jiang, Guoyun', 'Wang, Teng', 'Mou, Ke', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Li Q', 'Huang Z', 'Peng Y', 'Wang X', 'Jiang G', 'Wang T', 'Mou K', 'Feng W']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Department of Clinical Hematology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Department of Clinical Hematology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Department of Clinical Hematology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Department of Clinical Hematology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Department of Clinical Hematology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Department of Clinical Hematology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210824,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'ERK1/2', 'RanBP3', 'imatinib', 'nuclear export']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 07:02'],"['2021/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 07:02 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.698410 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 24;11:698410. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.698410. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8421687,,,,,,,,,,

In-depth understanding of the biological variability of Treg in the human blood may be required to improve IBD immune monitoring and treatment strategies. Methods: Through a combination of quantitative proteomic, multiparametric flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing data analysis and functional assays on Treg enriched from the blood of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and healthy controls, we investigated the association between CD49f expression, Treg phenotype and function, and UC disease activity. Results: High-dimensional analysis and filtering defined two distinct subsets of human Treg based on the presence or absence of CD49f with divergent transcriptional landscape and functional activities. CD49f negative (CD49f(-)) Treg are enriched for functional Treg markers and present significantly increased suppressive capacity. In contrast, CD49f(high) Treg display a pro-inflammatory Th17-like phenotype and accumulate in the blood of patients with UC. Dysregulation on CD49f Treg subsets in patients with UC correlate with disease activity. Conclusion: Overall, our findings uncover the importance of CD49f expression on Treg in physiological immunity and in pathological autoimmunity.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Our previous work showed that loss of the pioneer factor KLF4 in a NOTCH1-induced T-ALL mouse model accelerated the development of leukemia through expansion of leukemia-initiating cells and activation of the MAP2K7 pathway. Similarly, epigenetic silencing of the KLF4 gene in children with T-ALL was associated with MAP2K7 activation. Here, we showed the small molecule 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (5Z7O) induces dose-dependent cytotoxicity in a panel of T-ALL cell lines mainly through inhibition of the MAP2K7-JNK pathway, which further validates MAP2K7 as a therapeutic target. Mechanistically, 5Z7O-mediated apoptosis was caused by the downregulation of regulators of the G2/M checkpoint and the inhibition of survival pathways. The anti-leukemic capacity of 5Z7O was evaluated using leukemic cells from two mouse models of T-ALL and patient-derived xenograft cells generated using lymphoblasts from pediatric T-ALL patients. Finally, a combination of 5Z7O with dexamethasone, a drug used in frontline therapy, showed synergistic induction of cytotoxicity. In sum, we report here that MAP2K7 inhibition thwarts survival mechanisms in T-ALL cells and warrants future pre-clinical studies for high-risk and relapsed patients.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Chen et al.'],"['Chen, Taylor J', 'Du, Wa', 'Junco, Jacob J', 'Bridges, Cory Seth', 'Shen, Ye', 'Puppi, Monica', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Lacorazza, H Daniel']","['Chen TJ', 'Du W', 'Junco JJ', 'Bridges CS', 'Shen Y', 'Puppi M', 'Rabin KR', 'Lacorazza HD']","['Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210831,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,['NOTNLM'],"['5z-7-oxozeaenol', 'MAP2K7', 'T-ALL']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 07:01'],"['2021/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 07:01 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.28040 [doi]', '28040 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2021 Aug 31;12(18):1787-1801. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.28040. eCollection 2021 Aug 31.,,,,18,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,PMC8416565,,,,,,,,,,

Error-prone alternative non-homologous end-joining (Alt-NHEJ) DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is upregulated in FLT3-ITD-expresssing cells, driven by c-Myc. The serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 is upregulated downstream of FLT3-ITD, and inhibiting Pim increases topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) inhibitor chemotherapy drug induction of DNA DSBs and apoptosis. We hypothesized that Pim inhibition increases DNA DSBs by downregulating Alt-NHEJ, also decreasing genomic instability. Alt-NHEJ activity, measured with a green fluorescent reporter construct, increased in FLT3-ITD-transfected Ba/F3-ITD cells treated with TOP2 inhibitors, and this increase was abrogated by Pim kinase inhibitor AZD1208 co-treatment. TOP2 inhibitor and AZD1208 co-treatment downregulated cellular and nuclear expression of c-Myc and Alt-NHEJ repair pathway proteins DNA polymerase theta, DNA ligase 3 and XRCC1 in FLT3-ITD cell lines and AML patient blasts. ALT-NHEJ protein downregulation was preceded by c-Myc downregulation, inhibited by c-Myc overexpression and induced by c-Myc knockdown or inhibition. TOP2 inhibitor treatment increased chromosome breaks in metaphase spreads in FLT3-ITD-expressing cells, and AZD1208 co-treatment abrogated these increases.

However, de novo and acquired resistance to 5-FU are frequently observed during treatment, which eventually lead to patients succumbing to the disease. Accumulating data have revealed an association of CRC resistance to 5-FU with aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRs). In the present study, Cell Counting Kit-8 was performed to measure cell viability, flow cytometry was performed to detect cell apoptosis, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted to measure proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) and miR-3135b expression, western blotting was conducted to measure PIM1 expression. Microarray data analysis indicated that the level of miR-3135b expression was decreased in patients with recurrent CRC that were treated with 5-FU when compared with non-recurrent cases. Overexpression of miR-3135b increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to 5-FU treatment. Moreover, PIM1 was identified as a target gene of miR-3135b using bioinformatics analysis, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. The direct interaction between these two targets was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. Notably, PIM1 overexpression compensated the effect of miR-3135b in CRC cells. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between PIM1 mRNA expression levels and miR-3135b expression was observed in clinical samples.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-221 (miR-221) in the regulation of cell viability and apoptosis of human T-ALL cells and its related regulatory mechanisms. To perform this investigation, miR-221 was upregulated or knocked down in human T-ALL cells (Jurkat cells) using miR-221 mimic or inhibitor, respectively. Then, cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiahiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenytetrazolium bromide assay, cell invasion and migration were analyzed via Transwell assays, and cell apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. It was found that transfection with a miR-221 inhibitor significantly inhibited Jurkat cell viability, migration and invasion, and induced Jurkat cell apoptosis. Whereas, transfection with the miR-221 mimic resulted in the opposite effects. Besides, the results showed that phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) was a target of miR-221. Moreover, it was observed that the effects of the miR-221 inhibitor on Jurkat cell viability, migration and invasion, and cell apoptosis were significantly eliminated by PTEN-small interfering RNA. In addition, it was shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway was involved in the effect of miR-221 on Jurkat cells. In conclusion, the data indicated that miR-221 existed as an oncogene in T-ALL, and its downregulation could inhibit the development of ALL by targeting PTEN. Therefore, miR-221 may be a novel potential therapeutic target for ALL.",['Copyright: (c) Zhang et al.'],"['Zhang, Lingyan', 'Bu, Zibin', 'Shen, Juan', 'Shang, Liping', 'Chen, Yuanyuan', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Wang, Yan']","['Zhang L', 'Bu Z', 'Shen J', 'Shang L', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang P', 'Wang Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center For Child Health, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, P.R.

Humans possess 18 KLF genes that are differentially expressed in various tissues. Several KLFs recognize a specific CACCC DNA motif that is commonly found within hematopoietic-specific promoters. To investigate those KLFs that are involved in human hemoglobin (Hb) switching, the present study analyzed a previous microarray data set from fetal and adult erythroid cells and validated the mRNA expression levels of 18 KLFs by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). KLF with a decreased expression level in the fetuses was selected for a functional study in human erythroid progenitor cells using lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA knockdown. The fetuses demonstrated a lower level of KLF4 mRNA expression when compared with the adults. Downregulation of KLF4 in erythroid progenitor cells from healthy individuals and individuals with beta(0)-thalassemia/HbE evidenced the increasing embryonic and fetal globin mRNA expression with neither significant cytotoxicity nor gene expression alteration of the examined globin regulators, KLF1, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A and lymphoma/leukemia-related factor. These findings demonstrate that the downregulation of KLF4 is associated with increased embryonic and fetal globin gene expression in human erythroid progenitor cells. Moreover, identifying putative compounds or molecular approaches that effectively downregulate KLF4 and further induce embryonic globin expression may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for alpha-globin substitution in severe alpha-thalassemia.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Spandidos Publications.']","['Khamphikham, Pinyaphat', 'Jearawiriyapaisarn, Natee', 'Tangprasittipap, Amornrat', 'Hongeng, Suradej']","['Khamphikham P', 'Jearawiriyapaisarn N', 'Tangprasittipap A', 'Hongeng S']","['Department of Forensic Science, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Thammasat University, Pathum Thani 12121, Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Thalassemia Research Center, Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.', 'Office of Research, Academic Affairs and Innovations, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210802,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,['NOTNLM'],"['Kruppel-like factor 4', 'embryonic globin', 'fetal globin']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 07:00'],"['2021/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 07:00 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2021.10539 [doi]', 'ETM-0-0-10539 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2021 Oct;22(4):1105. doi: 10.3892/etm.2021.10539.

NF-kappaB is often constitutively activated, and promotes metastasis and drug resistance in neoplastic cells. The present study assessed the cellular anticancer activity of an NF-kappaB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), on mouse plasmacytoma SP2/0 cells. Cellular invasion was measured by Matrigel chamber assay, and apoptosis was assessed by detecting caspase-3 cleavage and by flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V. DHMEQ inhibited constitutively activated NF-kappaB at nontoxic concentrations. DHMEQ was also shown to inhibit cellular invasion of SP2/0 cells, as well as human myeloma KMS-11 and RPMI-8226 cells. The metastasis PCR array indicated that DHMEQ induced a decrease in KISS1 receptor (KISS1R) expression in SP2/0 cells. Knockdown of KISS1R by small interfering RNA suppressed cellular invasion, suggesting that KISS1R may serve an essential role in the invasion of SP2/0 cells. Furthermore, DHMEQ enhanced cytotoxicity of the anticancer agent melphalan in SP2/0 cells. Notably, DHMEQ inhibited the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-XL, FLIP, and Bfl-1.

Here, we identify TNK1 dependencies in primary human cancers. We also discover a MARK-mediated phosphorylation on TNK1 at S502 that promotes an interaction between TNK1 and 14-3-3, which sequesters TNK1 and inhibits its kinase activity. Conversely, the release of TNK1 from 14-3-3 allows TNK1 to cluster in ubiquitin-rich puncta and become active. Active TNK1 induces growth factor-independent proliferation of lymphoid cells in cell culture and mouse models. One unusual feature of TNK1 is a ubiquitin-association domain (UBA) on its C-terminus. Here, we characterize the TNK1 UBA, which has high affinity for poly-ubiquitin. Point mutations that disrupt ubiquitin binding inhibit TNK1 activity. These data suggest a mechanism in which TNK1 toggles between 14-3-3-bound (inactive) and ubiquitin-bound (active) states. Finally, we identify a TNK1 inhibitor, TP-5801, which shows nanomolar potency against TNK1-transformed cells and suppresses tumor growth in vivo.",['(c) 2021.

Two DNMT1-depleting agents 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dCyd, decitabine) and 5-aza-cytidine (aza-Cyd, azacitidine) are currently used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia and have also been investigated for nononcology indications, such as sickle cell disease. However, these agents have several off-target activities leading to significant toxicities that limit dosing and duration of treatment. Development of more selective inhibitors of DNMT1 could therefore afford treatment of long durations at effective doses. We have discovered that 5-aza-4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-T-dCyd) is as effective as aza-dCyd in depleting DNMT1 in mouse tumor models but with markedly low toxicity. In this review we describe the preclinical studies that led to the development of aza-T-dCyd as a superior DNMT1-depleting agent with respect to aza-dCyd and will describe its pharmacology, metabolism, and mechanism of action. In an effort to understand why aza-T-dCyd is a more selective DNMT1 depleting agent than aza-dCyd, we will also compare and contrast the activities of these two agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Aza-T-dCyd is a potent DNMT1-depleting agent. Although similar in structure to decitabine (aza-dCyd), its metabolism and mechanism of action is different than that of aza-dCyd, resulting in less off-target activity and less toxicity. The larger therapeutic index of aza-T-dCyd (DNMT1 depletion vs. toxicity) in mice suggests that it would be a better clinical candidate to selectively deplete DNMT1 from target cells and determine whether or not depletion of DNMT1 is an effective target for various diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Parker, William B', 'Thottassery, Jaideep V']","['Parker WB', 'Thottassery JV']","['PNP Therapeutics, Birmingham, Alabama (W.B.P.); and UDG Healthcare, Smartanalyst - Ashfield Division, New York, New York (J.V.T.) jthottassery1@icloud.com bparker@pnptherapeutics.com.', 'PNP Therapeutics, Birmingham, Alabama (W.B.P.); and UDG Healthcare, Smartanalyst - Ashfield Division, New York, New York (J.V.T.) jthottassery1@icloud.com bparker@pnptherapeutics.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210909,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,,,2021/09/11 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/09/10 05:51'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/10 05:51 [entrez]']","['jpet.121.000758 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.121.000758 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2021 Nov;379(3):211-222. doi: 10.1124/jpet.121.000758.

We evaluated the humoral response following the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). An FDA-approved, ELISA-based methodology was implemented to evaluate the titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 on day 1 of the first vaccine, and afterwards on day 22 and 50. One hundred and thirty-two patients with CLL/lymphomas and 214 healthy matched controls vaccinated during the same period, at the same center were enrolled in the study (NCT04743388). Vaccination with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine led to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with CLL/lymphomas compared with controls both on day 22 and on day 50 (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Disease-related immune dysregulation and therapy-related immunosuppression are involved in the low humoral response. Importantly, active treatment with Rituximab, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for suboptimal antibody response. Patients with HL showed superior humoral responses to the NHL/CLL subgroups. In conclusion, patients with CLL/lymphomas have low humoral response following COVID-19 vaccination, underlining the need for timely vaccination ideally during a treatment-free period and for continuous vigilance on infection control measures.",,"['Terpos, Evangelos', 'Gavriatopoulou, Maria', 'Fotiou, Despina', 'Giatra, Chara', 'Asimakopoulos, Ioannis', 'Dimou, Maria', 'Sklirou, Aimilia D', 'Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis', 'Darmani, Ismini', 'Briasoulis, Alexandros', 'Kastritis, Efstathios', 'Angelopoulou, Maria', 'Baltadakis, Ioannis', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis', 'Trougakos, Ioannis P', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Pagoni, Maria', 'Dimopoulos, Meletios A']","['Terpos E', 'Gavriatopoulou M', 'Fotiou D', 'Giatra C', 'Asimakopoulos I', 'Dimou M', 'Sklirou AD', 'Ntanasis-Stathopoulos I', 'Darmani I', 'Briasoulis A', 'Kastritis E', 'Angelopoulou M', 'Baltadakis I', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Trougakos IP', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Pagoni M', 'Dimopoulos MA']","['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Hematology and Lymphomas, Evangelismos General Hospital, 10676 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'First Propedeutic Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 15784 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Hematology and Lymphomas, Evangelismos General Hospital, 10676 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Hematology and Lymphomas, Evangelismos General Hospital, 10676 Athens, Greece.', 'First Propedeutic Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 15784 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Hematology and Lymphomas, Evangelismos General Hospital, 10676 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210906,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BNT162b2 vaccine', ""*Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors"", '*COVID-19 vaccination', ""*Hodgkin's lymphoma"", '*Rituximab', '*SARS-CoV-2', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*humoral immune response', '*neutralizing antibodies', ""*non-Hodgkin's lymphoma""]",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 01:11'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 01:11 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13174480 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13174480 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Sep 6;13(17). pii: cancers13174480. doi: 10.3390/cancers13174480.,,,,17,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5133-1422', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5060-4847', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6328-9783', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6179-2772', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8990-3254']","['SYN-ENOSIS (Greece)/SYN-ENOSIS (Greece)', 'AEGEAS (Greece)/AEGEAS (Greece)', 'IEMBITHEK (Greece)/IEMBITHEK (Greece)', 'Nikos and Theano Vafeias/Nikos and Theano Vafeias']",PMC8430746,,,,,,,,,,

As an alternative mode of action, the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been proposed. Through an in silico analysis, we investigated the responses of approximately 800 cancer cell lines (50 entities; Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal, CTRP) to APR-246 treatment. In particular, neuroblastoma, lymphoma and acute lymphocytic leukemia cells were highly responsive. With gene expression data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE; n = 883) and patient samples (n = 1643) from the INFORM registry study, we confirmed that these entities express low levels of SLC7A11, a previously described predictive biomarker for APR-246 responsiveness. Combining the CTRP drug response data with the respective CCLE gene expression profiles, we defined a novel gene signature, predicting the effectiveness of APR-246 treatment with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 94%. We confirmed the predicted APR-246 sensitivity in 8/10 cell lines and in ex vivo cultures of patient samples. Moreover, the combination of ROS detoxification-impeding APR-246 with approved HDAC-inhibitors, known to elevate ROS, substantially increased APR-246 sensitivity in cell cultures and in vivo in two zebrafish neuroblastoma xenograft models.

The disease is characterized by an indolent and often asymptomatic course. However, in roughly 50% of cases, treatment is required due to severe transfusion-dependent anemia, severe neutropenia, or moderate neutropenia with associated recurrent infections. LGLL represents an interesting disease process at the intersection of a physiological immune response, autoimmune disorder, and malignant (clonal) proliferation, resulting from the aberrant activation of cellular pathways promoting survival, proliferation, and evasion of apoptotic signaling. LGLL treatment primarily consists of immunosuppressive agents (methotrexate, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide), with a cumulative response rate of about 60% based on longitudinal expertise and retrospective studies. However, refractory cases can result in clinical scenarios characterized by transfusion-dependent anemia and severe neutropenia, which warrant further exploration of other potential targeted treatment modalities. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the immune-genomic profiles of LGLL, its pathogenesis, and current treatment options, and discuss potential novel therapeutic agents, particularly for refractory disease.",,"['Zawit, Misam', 'Bahaj, Waled', 'Gurnari, Carmelo', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw']","['Zawit M', 'Bahaj W', 'Gurnari C', 'Maciejewski J']","['Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, PhD in Immunology, Molecular Medicine and Applied Biotechnology University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210901,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['immunogenomics', 'large granular lymphocytic leukemia', 'refractory disease']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 01:11'],"['2021/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 01:11 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13174418 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13174418 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Sep 1;13(17). pii: cancers13174418. doi: 10.3390/cancers13174418.,,,,17,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2991-4386', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6829-5544']","['R35 HL135795/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35HL135795/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AICFCG2021/American-Italian Cancer Foundation Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship']",PMC8430581,,,,,,,,,,

ALL is characterized by structural and numeric genomic aberrations that strongly correlate with prognosis and clinical outcome. Usually, a combination of cyto- and molecular genetic methods (karyotyping, array-CGH, FISH, RT-PCR, RNA-Seq) is needed to identify all aberrations relevant for risk stratification. We investigated the feasibility of optical genome mapping (OGM), a DNA-based method, to detect these aberrations in an all-in-one approach. As proof of principle, twelve pediatric ALL samples were analyzed by OGM, and results were validated by comparing OGM data to results obtained from routine diagnostics. All genomic aberrations including translocations (e.g., dic(9;12)), aneuploidies (e.g., high hyperdiploidy) and copy number variations (e.g., IKZF1, PAX5) known from other techniques were also detected by OGM. Moreover, OGM was superior to well-established techniques for resolution of the more complex structure of a translocation t(12;21) and had a higher sensitivity for detection of copy number alterations. Importantly, a new and unknown gene fusion of JAK2 and NPAT due to a translocation t(9;11) was detected. We demonstrate the feasibility of OGM to detect well-established as well as new putative prognostic markers in an all-in-one approach in ALL.

We optimized the TRBC1-FCM approach for detecting clonal Talphabeta-cells and validated the method in 211 normal, reactive and pathological samples. TRBC1 labeling significantly improved in the presence of CD3. Purified TRBC1(+) and TRBC1(-) monoclonal and polyclonal Talphabeta-cells rearranged TRBJ1 in 44/47 (94%) and TRBJ1+TRBJ2 in 48 of 48 (100%) populations, respectively, which confirmed the high specificity of this assay. Additionally, TRBC1(+)/TRBC1(-) ratios within different Talphabeta-cell subsets are provided as reference for polyclonal cells, among which a bimodal pattern of TRBC1-expression profile was found for all TCRVbeta families, whereas highly-variable TRBC1(+)/TRBC1(-) ratios were observed in more mature vs. naive Talphabeta-cell subsets (vs. total T-cells). In 112/117 (96%) samples containing clonal Talphabeta-cells in which the approach was validated, monotypic expression of TRBC1 was confirmed. Dilutional experiments showed a level of detection for detecting clonal Talphabeta-cells of </=10(-4) in seven out of eight pathological samples. These results support implementation of the optimized TRBC1-FCM approach as a fast, specific and accurate method for assessing T-cell clonality in diagnostic-FCM panels, and for minimal (residual)

Cells were incubated in atmosphere at 0.2% oxygen in the absence or the presence of glutamine. The absence of glutamine markedly delayed glucose consumption, which had previously been shown to drive the suppression of BCR/Abl oncoprotein (but not of the fusion oncogene BCR/abl) in low oxygen. Glutamine availability thus emerged as a key regulator of the balance between the pools of BCR/Abl protein-expressing and -negative CML cells endowed with stem/progenitor cell potential and capable to stand extremely low oxygen. These findings were confirmed by the effects of the inhibitors of glucose or glutamine metabolism. The BCR/Abl-negative cell phenotype is the best candidate to sustain the treatment-resistant minimal residual disease (MRD) of CML because these cells are devoid of the molecular target of the BCR/Abl-active tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) used for CML therapy. Therefore, the treatments capable of interfering with glutamine action may result in the reduction in the BCR/Abl-negative cell subset sustaining MRD and in the concomitant rescue of the TKi sensitivity of CML stem cell potential.

While the incidence of aggressive forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma decreased after the advent of cART, incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has increased among PLWH in recent decades. The coinfection of Epstein-Barr virus plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HL in the HIV setting. Currently, PLWH with HRL, including HL, are treated similarly to HIV-negative patients and, importantly, the prognosis of HL in PLWH is approaching that of the general population. In this regard, effective cART during chemotherapy is strongly recommended since it has been shown to improve survival rates in all lymphoma subtypes, including HL. As a consequence, interdisciplinary collaboration between HIV specialists and hemato-oncologists for the management of potential drug-drug interactions and overlapping toxicities between antiretroviral and antineoplastic drugs is crucial for the optimal treatment of PLWH with HL.

While improvements in outcome have been observed with immunotherapy in many cancer types, immunotherapy development and implementation into patient care for both adult and pediatric AML has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the bone marrow environment and a paucity of tumor-specific antigens. Since only a minority of patients respond in most immunotherapy trials across different cancer types, it will be crucial to understand which children with AML are likely to respond to or may benefit from immunotherapies. Immune cell profiling efforts hold promise to answer this question, as illustrated by the development of predictive scores in solid cancers. Such information on the number and phenotype of immune cells during current treatment regimens will be pivotal to generate hypotheses on how and when to intervene with immunotherapy in pediatric AML. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the number and phenotype of immune cells in the bone marrow in pediatric AML, ongoing immunotherapy trials and how comprehensive immune profiling efforts may pave the way for successful clinical trials (and, ultimately, implementation into patient care).",,"['Koedijk, Joost B', 'van der Werf, Inge', 'Calkoen, Friso G', 'Nierkens, Stefan', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Zwaan, Christian Michel', 'Heidenreich, Olaf']","['Koedijk JB', 'van der Werf I', 'Calkoen FG', 'Nierkens S', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Zwaan CM', 'Heidenreich O']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210828,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'children', 'immune landscape', 'immune monitoring', 'immune profiling', 'immunotherapy', 'tumor immune microenvironment']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 01:11'],"['2021/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 01:11 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13174364 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13174364 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Aug 28;13(17). pii: cancers13174364. doi: 10.3390/cancers13174364.,,,,17,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8159-399X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9059-0929', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3406-817X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7716-8475', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5404-6483']",['329/Stichting Kinderen Kankervrij'],PMC8431730,,,,,,,,,,

Helix pomatia lectin (HPA) is another T/Tn-specific lectin, currently used as tool for cancer diagnostics. The HPA-mediated tumor cell death was evaluated on human leukemia and mouse lymphoma cells, and compared to the effect of Morniga G. Both lectins induced an equivalent percentage of cell death in Tn-positive Jurkat human leukemia. In contrast, EL4 mouse lymphoma resisted Morniga G-mediated cytotoxicity but were killed by HPA at concentrations of 2.5 mug/mL (0.032 nM) and higher. In both malignant cells, HPA-mediated cell death showed features compatible with apoptosis (annexin-externalization, caspase-activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and ROS production). Cytometry analysis indicated that EL4 cells are T/Tn-negative. Because previous results showed a high amount of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc, sugar present in Tn antigen) on EL4 cell surface, this GalNAc could be involved in the formation of truncated O-glycans other than the T/Tn residues. When compared to Morniga G, bioinformatic analysis suggested that HPA benefits from an extended carbohydrate-binding site, better adapted than Morniga G to the accommodation of more complex branched and truncated O-glycans (such as core 2).

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to construct networks of co-expressed genes, and detect gene modules. Finally, hub genes were identified from selected modules by applying network-based methods. This robust and integrative bioinformatics approach revealed a set of twenty-four genes, mainly related to cell cycle and immune response, the diagnostic significance of which was subsequently compared against two independent gene expression datasets. Furthermore, based on a recent notion suggesting that molecular characteristics of a few, unusual patients with exceptionally favorable survival can provide insights for improving the outcome of individuals with more typical disease trajectories, we defined groups of long-term survivors in AML patient cohorts and compared their transcriptomes versus the general population to infer favorable prognostic signatures.

Because of their pivotal role in hemostasis, HOXA9 and MEIS1 appear non-druggable. We, thus, interrogated gene expression data of pre-leukemic (overexpressing Hoxa9) and leukemogenic (overexpressing Hoxa9 and Meis1; H9M) murine cell lines to identify cancer vulnerabilities. Through gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analyses, we compiled a list of 15 candidates for functional validation. Using a novel lentiviral multiplexing approach, we selected and tested highly active sgRNAs to knockout candidate genes by CRISPR/Cas9, and subsequently identified a H9M cell growth dependency on the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A). Similar results were obtained by shRNA-mediated suppression of Pla2g4a. Remarkably, pharmacologic inhibition of PLA2G4A with arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) accelerated the loss of H9M cells in bulk cultures. Additionally, AACOCF3 treatment of H9M cells reduced colony numbers and colony sizes in methylcellulose. Moreover, AACOCF3 was highly active in human AML with MLL rearrangement, in which PLA2G4A was significantly higher expressed than in AML patients without MLL rearrangement, and is sufficient as an independent prognostic marker.

Sporadically, CLL cases with multiple productive heavy and light-chain rearrangements were detected, thus leading to a bi- or oligoclonal CLL disease with leukemic cells originating either from different B cells or otherwise descending from secondary immunoglobulin rearrangement events. This suggests a potential role of clonal hematopoiesis or germline predisposition in these cases. During the screening of 75 CLL cases for kappa and lambda light-chain rearrangements, we could detect a single case with CLL cells expressing two distinct kappa and lambda light chains paired with two separate immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable regions.

Splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); patients carrying these mutations have a poor prognosis. Since the splicing machinery and the epigenome are closely interconnected, we investigated whether these alterations may affect the epigenomes of CLL patients. While an overall hypomethylation during CLL carcinogenesis has been observed, the interplay between the epigenetic stage of the originating B cells and SF3B1 mutations, and the subsequent effect of the mutations on methylation alterations in CLL, have not been investigated. We profiled the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of 27 CLL patients with and without SF3B1 mutations and identified local decreases in methylation levels in SF3B1(mut) CLL patients at 67 genomic regions, mostly in proximity to telomeric regions. These differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were enriched in gene bodies of cancer-related signaling genes, e.g., NOTCH1, HTRA3, and BCL9L. In our study, SF3B1 mutations exclusively emerged in two out of three epigenetic stages of the originating B cells.

However, the genetic background underlying this predisposition remains elusive. We herein aimed at the exploration of the genetic variants, related transcriptomic changes and disturbances in metabolic pathways shared by T2D and AML, utilizing bioinformatics tools and repositories, as well as publicly available clinical datasets. Our approach revealed that rs11709077 and rs1801282, on PPARG, rs11108094 on USP44, rs6685701 on RPS6KA1 and rs7929543 on AC118942.1 comprise common SNPs susceptible to the two diseases and, together with 64 other co-inherited proxy SNPs, may affect the expression patterns of metabolic genes, such as USP44, METAP2, PPARG, TIMP4 and RPS6KA1, in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas and whole blood. Most importantly, a set of 86 AML/T2D common susceptibility genes was found to be significantly associated with metabolic cellular processes, including purine, pyrimidine, and choline metabolism, as well as insulin, AMPK, mTOR and PI3K signaling. Moreover, it was revealed that the whole blood of AML patients exhibits deregulated expression of certain T2D-related genes. Our findings support the existence of common metabolic perturbations in AML and T2D that may account for the increased risk for AML in T2D patients. Future studies may focus on the elucidation of these pathogenetic mechanisms in AML/T2D patients, as well as on the assessment of certain susceptibility variants and genes as potential biomarkers for AML development in the setting of T2D. Detection of shared therapeutic molecular targets may enforce the need for repurposing metabolic drugs in the therapeutic management of AML.",,"['Kyriakou, Theodora-Christina', 'Papageorgis, Panagiotis', 'Christodoulou, Maria-Ioanna']","['Kyriakou TC', 'Papageorgis P', 'Christodoulou MI']","['Tumor Microenvironment, Metastasis and Experimental Therapeutics Laboratory, Basic and Translational Cancer Research Center, Department of Life Sciences, European University Cyprus, Nicosia 2404, Cyprus.', 'Tumor Microenvironment, Metastasis and Experimental Therapeutics Laboratory, Basic and Translational Cancer Research Center, Department of Life Sciences, European University Cyprus, Nicosia 2404, Cyprus.', 'European University Cyprus Research Center, Nicosia 2404, Cyprus.', 'Tumor Immunology and Biomarkers Laboratory, Basic and Translational Cancer Research Center, Department of Life Sciences, European University Cyprus, Nicosia 2404, Cyprus.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210828,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'metabolic pathways', 'single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)', 'type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D)']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/09/10 01:07'],"['2021/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22179322 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22179322 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Aug 28;22(17). pii: ijms22179322. doi: 10.3390/ijms22179322.,20211018,['0 (Biomarkers)'],"['Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Metabolic Networks and Pathways', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",17,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7595-5616', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1659-4993']",,PMC8431701,,,,,,,,,,

Conventionally, empirical antifungal therapy was recommended to treat IFIs for patient safety despite a lack of evidence of fungal infections. However, many studies have indicated that antifungals were not necessary for over half of patients, and several detriments of empirical therapy were noted, e.g., antifungals caused adverse reactions, an increase in drug-resistant fungi was a possibility, and medical costs soared. beta-D-glucan (BDG) is a component of clinically important fungi such as Aspergillus and Candida. The G-test was developed in Japan as a way to measure BDG in serum using a coagulation factor from the blood of the horseshoe crab. Pre-emptive antifungal therapy based upon serodiagnosis with a BDG or galactomannan assay and CT imaging has been introduced. With pre-emptive antifungal therapy, the prognosis is equivalent to that with empirical therapy, and the dose of the antifungal has been successfully reduced.

Different in silico instruments and in vitro/ex vivo immunological platforms have identified the most immunogenic epitopes from NPM1-mutated protein. Spontaneous development of endogenous NPM1-mutated-specific cytotoxic T cells has been observed in patients, potentially contributing to remission maintenance and prolonged survival. Genetically engineered T cells, namely CAR-T or TCR-transduced T cells, directed against NPM1-mutated peptides bound to HLA could prospectively represent a promising therapeutic approach. Although either adoptive or vaccine-based immunotherapies are unlikely to be highly effective in patients with full-blown leukemia, these strategies, potentially in combination with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, could be promising in maintaining remission or preemptively eradicating persistent measurable residual disease, mainly in patients ineligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Alternatively, neoantigen-specific donor lymphocyte infusion derived from healthy donors and targeting NPM1-mutated protein to selectively elicit graft-versus-leukemia effect may represent an attractive option in subjects experiencing post-HSCT relapse.

We determined whether enclave residence was associated with ALL survival, overall and among Hispanic children. We computed Hispanic enclave index scores for Texas census tracts, and classified children (N = 4083) as residing in enclaves if their residential tracts scored in the highest statewide quintile. We used Cox regression to evaluate the association between enclave residence and OS. Five-year OS was 78.6% for children in enclaves, and 77.8% for Hispanic children in enclaves, both significantly lower (p < 0.05) than the 85.8% observed among children not in enclaves. Children in enclaves had increased risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.49) after adjustment for sex, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, metropolitan residence and neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and after further adjustment for child race/ethnicity (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.97-1.45). We observed increased risk of death when analyses were restricted to Hispanic children specifically (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.65). Observations suggest that children with ALL residing in Hispanic enclaves experience inferior OS.",,"['Schraw, Jeremy M', 'Peckham-Gregory, Erin C', 'Hughes, Amy E', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Pruitt, Sandi L', 'Lupo, Philip J']","['Schraw JM', 'Peckham-Gregory EC', 'Hughes AE', 'Scheurer ME', 'Pruitt SL', 'Lupo PJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."", 'Department of Population and Data Sciences, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Harold C.

In the past, amylases have been reported to be a possible sign of TBI toxicity. We investigated the relationship between total amylases (TA) and transplant-related outcomes in pediatric recipients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of all the patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT between January 2000 and November 2019. The inclusion criteria were the following: recipient's age between 2 and 18, diagnosis of ALL, no previous transplantation, and use of TBI-based conditioning. The serum total amylase and pancreatic amylase were evaluated before, during, and after transplantation. Cytokines and chemokines assays were retrospectively performed. RESULTS: 78 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Fifty-seven patients were treated with fractionated TBI, and 21 with a single-dose regimen. The overall survival (OS) was 62.8%. Elevated values of TA were detected in 71 patients (91%). The TA were excellent in predicting the OS (AUC = 0.773; 95% CI = 0.66-0.86; p < 0.001). TA values below 374 U/L were correlated with a higher OS. The highest mean TA values (673 U/L) were associated with a high disease-progression mortality rate. The TA showed a high predictive performance for disease progression-related death (AUC = 0.865; 95% CI = 0.77-0.93; p < 0.0001). Elevated TA values were also connected with significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and RANTES (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: this study shows that TA is a valuable predictor of post-transplant OS and increased risk of leukemia relapse.",,"['Baldo, Francesco', 'Simeone, Roberto', 'Marcuzzi, Annalisa', 'Grasso, Antonio Giacomo', 'Vidimari, Rossella', 'Ciriello, Francesca', 'Zanon, Davide', 'Maestro, Alessandra', 'Barbi, Egidio', 'Maximova, Natalia']","['Baldo F', 'Simeone R', 'Marcuzzi A', 'Grasso AG', 'Vidimari R', 'Ciriello F', 'Zanon D', 'Maestro A', 'Barbi E', 'Maximova N']","['Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Piazzale Europa 1, 34127 Trieste, Italy.', ""Department of Transfusion Medicine, ASUGI, Piazza dell'Ospitale 1, 34125 Trieste, Italy."", 'Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara, via Ludovico Ariosto 35, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', ""Institute for Maternal and Child Health-IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, via dell'Istria 65/1, 34137 Trieste, Italy."", 'Department of Medical Physics, ASUGI, via Pieta 2/2, 34129 Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, ASUGI, via Pieta 19, 34129 Trieste, Italy.', ""Institute for Maternal and Child Health-IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, via dell'Istria 65/1, 34137 Trieste, Italy."", ""Institute for Maternal and Child Health-IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, via dell'Istria 65/1, 34137 Trieste, Italy."", 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Piazzale Europa 1, 34127 Trieste, Italy.', ""Institute for Maternal and Child Health-IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, via dell'Istria 65/1, 34137 Trieste, Italy."", ""Institute for Maternal and Child Health-IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, via dell'Istria 65/1, 34137 Trieste, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210826,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,['NOTNLM'],"['hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'leukemia relapse', 'overall survival', 'pediatric patients', 'proinflammatory cytokines', 'total amylase', 'total body irradiation']",2021/09/11 06:00,2021/09/11 06:01,['2021/09/10 01:03'],"['2021/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10173834 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10173834 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Aug 26;10(17). pii: jcm10173834. doi: 10.3390/jcm10173834.,,,,17,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3427-618X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0934-1875']",,PMC8432189,,,,,,,,,,

These include the identification of risk-associated ALL subtypes (e.g., those with rearrangements of MEF2D, DUX4, NUTM1, ZNF384 and BCL11B; the PAX5 P80R and IKZF1 N159Y mutations; and genomic phenocopies such as Ph-like ALL) and the genomic basis of disease evolution. These advances have been complemented by the development of novel therapeutic approaches, including those that are of mutation-specific, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and those that are mutation-agnostic, including antibody and cellular immunotherapies, and protein degradation strategies such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras.

Over the years, progress in high-resolution donor typing, choice of conditioning regimen, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis and supportive care measures have continuously improved overall transplant outcome, and recent successes using alternative donors have extended the potential application of allotransplantation to most patients. In addition, the importance of minimal residual disease (MRD) before and after transplantation is being increasingly clarified and MRD-directed interventions may be employed to further ameliorate leukemia-free survival after allogeneic HSCT. These advances have occurred in parallel with continuous refinements in chemotherapy protocols and the development of targeted therapies, which may redefine the indications for HSCT in the coming years.

The stromal Ser/Thr protein kinase C (PKC) has been found to be important for conferring protection to leukemic cells. We aimed at elucidating the intracellular signals connected to cell adhesion and to stromal PKC. We found that NF-kappaB and Akt were up-regulated in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) after binding of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells. Nevertheless, Akt inhibition did not induce B-ALL cell detachment. In spite of a clear activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway after B-ALL cell binding (up-regulation NF-kappaB1/2, and down-regulation of the IKBepsilon and IKBalpha inhibitors) and an important reduction in cell adhesion after NF-kappaB inhibition, sensitization to the drug treatment was not observed. This was opposite to the PKC inhibitors Enzastaurin and HKPS, a novel chimeric peptide inhibitor, that were able to increase sensitization to dexamethasone, methotrexate, and vincristine. PLCgamma1, Erk1/2, and CREB appear to be related to PKC signaling and PKC effect on drug sensitization since they were contra-regulated by HKPS when compared to dexamethasone-treated cells. Additionally, PKC inhibition by HKPS, but not by Enzastaurin, in MSC reduced the activity of three ABC transporters in leukemic cells treated with dexamethasone, a new indirect mechanism to increase sensitization to drug treatment in B-ALL cells.

In addition to being immunocompromised, pandemic-related travel restrictions have impacted access to treatments and overseas stem cell donations for patients requiring transplantation. Given this vulnerability, people with haematological cancers are at risk of experiencing heightened distress during the pandemic. This study aimed to explore haematological cancer patients' experiences and needs. METHODS: Twenty-four Australian haematological cancer patients completed semi-structured interviews exploring their concerns and worries during the pandemic, impact of pandemic on management of disease, access to information and support, lifestyle changes, and attitudes towards emerging models of healthcare during the pandemic. Interview transcripts were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four themes reflecting the experiences of haematological cancer patients during the pandemic were identified: 'Fears about contracting COVID-19' (behaviour changes to protect health, impact on daily routine and habits, annoyance at dismissive attitude of others toward COVID-19); 'Reduced sense of connection and support' (reduced social support and access to external support services); 'New challenges' (increased financial hardship, worsened health), and; 'Underlying system and communication issues' (access to trusted information, satisfaction/dissatisfaction with care, navigating telehealth). Participants expressed a need for improved access to support services and trusted information. CONCLUSIONS: The findings emphasise the additional challenges experienced by haematological cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on daily life. Results point to the importance of validation of increased distress during periods of uncertainty; reinforcing recommendations about high-quality sources of information; and facilitating access to support services when face-to-face care is limited.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Preventing a dismal outcome of PCL requires early diagnosis with appropriate analytical tools. Therefore, the investigation of 33 patients with primary and secondary PCL was done when the quantity of circulating plasma cells (PCs) using flow cytometry (FC) and morphology assessment was evaluated. The phenotypic profile of the PCs was also analysed to determine if there is an association with clinical outcomes and to evaluate the prognostic value of analysed markers. Our results revealed that FC is an excellent method for identifying circulating PCs as a significantly higher number was identified by FC than by morphology (26.7% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.02). None of secondary PCL cases expressed CD19 or CD20. A low level of expression with similar positivity of CD27, CD28, CD81 and CD117 was found in both PCL groups. A decrease of CD44 expression was detected only in secondary PCL. Expression of CD56 was present in more than half of PCL cases as well as cytoplasmic nestin. A decreased level of platelets, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 2-3 and lack of CD20(+) PC were associated with a higher risk of death. FC could be incorporated in PCL diagnostics not only to determine the number of circulating PCs, but also to assess their phenotype profile and this information should be useful in patients' diagnosis and possible prognosis.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

In Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group trial MLL-10, by introducing intensive chemotherapy, indication of HSCT was restricted to patients with high-risk (HR) features only (KMT2A-r and either age <180 days or presence of central nervous system leukemia). Of the 56 HR patients, 49 achieved complete remission. Forty-three patients received HSCT in first remission including 38 patients receiving protocol-specified HSCT with conditioning consisting of individualized targeted doses of busulfan, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. Three-year event-free survival (EFS) of 56.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.4% to 68.8%) and overall survival of 80.2% (95% CI, 67.1% to 88.5%) were accomplished. Univariable analysis showed that Interfant-HR criteria and flow cytometric minimal residual disease (MRD; >/=0.01%), both at the end of induction and at the end of consolidation (EOC), were significantly associated with poorer EFS. In the multivariable analysis, positive MRD at EOC was solely associated with poor EFS (P < .001). Rapid pretransplant MRD clearance and tailored HSCT strategy in the MLL-10 trial resulted in a favorable outcome for infants with HR KMT2A-r ALL. However, considering the high rate of potentially life-threatening toxicities and the risk of late effects, its indication should be further restricted or even eliminated in the future by introducing more effective therapeutic modalities with minimal toxicities.

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational study to clarify the treatment outcomes of aggressive ATL in the current era. Between 2015 and 2018, 113 patients aged 70 years or younger with newly diagnosed aggressive ATL were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis was 61 years. Treatment outcomes were compared with those of 1792 ATL patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2013 in our previous retrospective study. The inclusion criteria were the same in both studies. The prospective cohort demonstrated better overall survival (OS) than the retrospective cohort (2-year OS, 45% vs 29%, respectively; P < .001), with a much higher proportion of patients receiving allo-HCT (80% vs 34%, respectively; P < .001) and a shorter interval from diagnosis to allo-HCT (median, 128 vs 170 days, respectively; P < .001). Among the 90 patients who received allo-HCT (cord blood, n = 30; HLA-haploidentical related donors, n = 20; other related donors, n = 14; other unrelated donors, n = 26), the 2-year probabilities of OS, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and disease progression were 44%, 23%, and 46%, respectively. OS and NRM did not differ statistically according to donor type. Our results suggest that increased application of allo-HCT improved the survival of patients with aggressive ATL. The use of cord blood or HLA-haploidentical donors may be feasible for aggressive ATL when HLA-matched related donors are unavailable.

We aimed to analyze the utility of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels compared with C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) during febrile neutropenia episodes of pediatric patients with leukemia. METHODS: Two plasma samples, on day 0 (initial of episode) and day 3 (48-72 h after episode), for VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and VEGF, CRP and PCT were prospectively collected concomitantly during each febrile neutropenic episode between December 2016 and December 2017. The primary outcome was bacteremia and the secondary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Twenty-two (28.6%) acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL), seventeen (22.1%) acute myeloblastic lymphoma (AML) patients and thirty-eight (49.3%) control patients with no known underlying disease or fever were included in this study. Of the 39 patients; 16 (41%) had bacteremia. Mean serum sVCAM1 and sICAM1 levels were significantly higher in control group, compared to FN patients (p < 0.001). Mean serum sVCAM2 level was significantly higher in FN patients with bacteremia compared to FN patients without bacteremia (144.97 +/- 70.35 pg/mL vs 85.45 +/- 53.76 pg/mL, p = 0.022). Mean sVCAM1 and 2 levels were higher in FN patients with ICU admission. In this study, we found that sVCAM-1 and VEGF, when combined to CRP and PCT, could predict gram-negative bacteremia in FN episodes of pediatric hematological malignancy. CONCLUSION: Serum endothelial adhesion molecules, excluding sVCAM-1, cannot predict bacteremia and ICU admission alone in FN patients; but may be associated with clinical outcome when used with PCT and CRP.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

There are at least 3 donor options: a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD), umbilical cord blood (UCB), and a haploidentical related donor (haplo); however, the optimal alternative donor type remains to be established. This study aimed to address how the outcomes of patients receiving these 3 alternative donor HCTs differ, and whether these outcomes change over time post-transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed Japanese nationwide transplantation registry data of adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic HCT while in first complete remission (CR) from an MMUD with a 7/8 match at the allele level (n = 601), with UCB (n = 1110), or from a haploidentical related donor (n = 221) between 2007 and 2018. For patients who underwent transplantation between 2007 and 2014, the 3-year overall survival (OS) for the MMUD, UCB, and Haplo groups was 60%, 54%, and 47%, respectively (P = .022). For those who underwent transplantation between 2015 and 2018, the 3-year OS in these groups was 60%, 66%, and 63%, respectively (P = .693). Multivariate analysis revealed that the risks of both overall mortality and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were significantly lower in the later period than in the earlier period in the UCB group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [P < .001] for OS; HR, 0.64 [P < .001] for NRM) and the Haplo group (HR, 0.58 [P = .019 for OS; HR, 0.39 [P = .004] for NRM), but not in the MMUD group (HR, 1.07 [P = .631] for OS; HR, 1.26 [P = .175] for NRM). The results of a test for interaction showed a significant difference in the effect of transplantation period on OS and NRM between the MMUD and UCB groups (P = .014 for OS; P = .004 for NRM) and between the MMUD and Haplo groups (P = .034 for OS; P = .003 for NRM). These findings demonstrate the recent improvements in the outcomes of UCB and Haplo transplantations in patients with AML in first CR that have resulted in a similar OS in patients undergoing HCT with grafts from MMUDs, UCB, and haploidentical donors in the later period of the study.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

An assessment of prognostic factors is an important part of treatment decision making and has the potential to be greatly improved by the inclusion of molecular genetics. However, there is a significant knowledge gap in the interpretation of mutational patterns. This study aimed to describe outcomes of allogeneic HCT in patients with CMML in relation to clinical and molecular genetic risk factors. This retrospective study included 64 patients with CMML who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2018, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Next-generation sequencing using targeted myeloid panels was carried out on saved material from 51 patients from the time of transplantation. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used for analysis of overall survival (OS), and cumulative incidence with competing risks and Fine and Gray models were used for analysis of relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Mutations were detected in 48 patients (94%), indicating high levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity at transplantation, even among those in complete remission (CR) (n = 14), 86% of whom had detectable mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were ASXL1 (37%), TET2 (37%), RUNX1 (33%), SRSF2 (26%), and NRAS (20%). Risk stratification using the CMML-specific Prognostic Scoring System molecular score (CPSS-Mol) resulted in 45% of patients moving to a higher risk-group compared with risk stratification using the CPSS. High leucocyte count (>/=13 x 10(9)/L), transfusion requirement, and previous intensive chemotherapy were associated with higher incidence of relapse. Being in CR was not linked to better outcomes. Neither ASXL1 nor RUNX1 mutation was associated with a difference in OS, relapse, or NRM, despite being high risk in the nontransplantation setting. TET2 mutations were associated with a significantly higher 3-year OS (73% versus 40%; P = .039). Achieving MRD-negative CR was rare in this CMML cohort, which may explain why we did not observe better outcomes for those in CR. This merits further investigation. Our analyses suggest that the negative impact of ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations can be overcome by allogeneic HCT; however, risk stratification is complex in CMML and requires larger cohorts and multivariate models, presenting an ongoing challenge in this rare disease.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Despite this clear functional definition, highly enriched isolation of human HSCs can currently only be achieved through combinatorial assessment of multiple surface antigens. Although several transgenic HSC reporter mouse strains have been described, no analogous approach to prospectively isolate human HSCs has been reported. To identify genes with the most selective expression in human HSCs, we profiled population and single-cell transcriptomes of unexpanded and ex vivo cultured cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as well as peripheral blood, adult bone marrow, and fetal liver. On the basis of these analyses, we propose the master transcription factor HLF (hepatic leukemia factor) as one of the most specific HSC marker genes. To directly track its expression in human hematopoietic cells, we developed a genomic HLF reporter strategy, capable of selectively labeling the most immature blood cells on the basis of a single engineered parameter.

AIMS: To address this issue in a clinical 'real-life' setting, we retrospectively analyzed 45 CP-CML patients (pts) followed in 20 Italian Centers and treated frontline with dasatinib (DAS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Median age was 78.4 years (range 75-89.2 years). DAS starting dose was 100 mg QD in 35 pts (77.7%), 80 mg QD in 1 pts (2.2%) and 50 mg QD in 9 pts (20.1%), respectively. The median follow-up was 42.6 months (IQR 20.4 - 63.3). RESULTS: Grade 3 and 4 side effects, both hematological and non-hematological, were detected in 6 (13.3%) and 12 (26.6%) pts, respectively. Pleural effusions of all grades occurred in 13 pts (28.8%) after a median period of DAS exposure of 14.7 months (IQR 3.0 - 33.1). The rates of DAS dose reduction and permanent drug discontinuation were 53.3% and 20.0%, respectively. As the best response, 42/45 patients (93.3%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), 35/45 (77.7%) a major molecular response (MMR) and 24/45 (53.3%) a deep molecular response (both MR 4.0 and MR 4.5). Only 1 patient (2.2%) progressed to the blast phase after 13 months of therapy; 8 deaths were observed (1 CML-related and 7 CML-unrelated). Cumulative event-free survival and overall survival at 36 months were 64.7% (95%, CI 49.4 - 80.0) and 82.3% (95%, CI 70.3-94.3), respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings, although evaluated in a limited and selected cohort of patients, suggest that DAS might be effective in older patients (aged >75 years) affected by CP-CML with acceptable toxicity.",,"['Stagno, Fabio', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Trawinska, Malgorzata Monika', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Sora, Federica', 'Leonetti Crescenzi, Sabrina', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Bucelli, Cristina', 'Colafigli, Gioia', 'Feo, Costanzo', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Mauro, Endri', 'Russo Rossi, Antonella', 'Guarini, Attilio', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Latagliata, Roberto']","['Stagno F', 'Breccia M', 'Annunziata M', 'Trawinska MM', 'Iurlo A', 'Sgherza N', 'Fava C', 'Gozzini A', 'Luciano L', 'Carmosino I', 'Bonifacio M', 'Sora F', 'Leonetti Crescenzi S', 'Crugnola M', 'Gugliotta G', 'Galimberti S', 'Bucelli C', 'Colafigli G', 'Feo C', 'Tiribelli M', 'Mauro E', 'Russo Rossi A', 'Guarini A', 'Abruzzese E', 'Rosti G', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Latagliata R']","['Hematology Section and BMT Unit, Rodolico Hospital, AOU Policlinico Rodolico-San Marco, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, S.

Hypoalbuminemia is a negative predictor of morbidity and mortality in several malignancies. We evaluated the relationship between baseline serum albumin levels on treatment-related complications, as well as short-term mortality and overall survival (OS) in 756 newly diagnosed AML patients. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study to examine treatment-related complications and OS according to pretreatment serum albumin levels: normal albumin >/=3.5 g/dl, marked hypoalbuminemia <2.5 g/dl, and hypoalbuminemia 2.5-3.4 g/dl. In an adjusted multivariate analysis, a lower baseline albumin was independently associated with a higher number of grade >/=3 complications when adjusting for age, secondary AML, sex and intensive treatment. When comparing normal to markedly low albumin levels, the estimated mean number of complications increases by a factor of 1.35. Patients who had a normal baseline albumin had a 30 day-mortality rate of 4.8%, which was significantly lower compared with patients with hypoalbuminemia (16.5%) and marked hypoalbuminemia (33.9%; p < 0.01). Similarly, 60-day mortality rate was significantly higher in the hypoalbuminemia group (24.0%) and marked hypoalbuminemia group (45%) compared with normal albumin group (8.3%; p < 0.01). Patients with lower baseline albumin levels have increased treatment-related morbidity and mortality, suggesting that pre-treatment serum albumin is an important independent prognostic marker.","['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Doucette, Kimberley', 'Percival, Mary-Elizabeth', 'Williams, Lacey', 'Kandahari, Adrese', 'Taylor, Allison', 'Wang, Shuqi', 'Ahn, Jaeil', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Lai, Catherine']","['Doucette K', 'Percival ME', 'Williams L', 'Kandahari A', 'Taylor A', 'Wang S', 'Ahn J', 'Karp JE', 'Lai C']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins University Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210909,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'albumin', 'biomarker', 'prognosis']",2021/09/10 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/09/09 12:34'],"['2021/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/09 12:34 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2925 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Dec;39(5):697-706. doi: 10.1002/hon.2925.

While the unique biological drivers of CMML and subsequent leukemic transformation (LT) have been revealed with advances in molecular characterization, this has not yet translated to the bedside. Here, we review these biologic drivers, outcomes with current therapies, and rationale avenues of future investigation specifically in blast phase CMML (CMML-BP). RECENT FINDINGS: CMML-BP outcomes are studied as an aggregate with more common categories of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRCs) or the even broader category of secondary AML (sAML), which illustrates the crux of the problem. While a modest survival advantage with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant exists, the difficulty is bridging patients to transplant and managing patients that require an allograft-sparing approach. Limited data suggest that short-lived remissions can be obtained employing CPX-351 or venetoclax-based lower intensity combination therapy. Promising future strategies include repurposing cladribine, exploiting the supportive role of dendritic cell subsets with anti-CD123 therapies, MCL-1 inhibition, dual MEK/PLK1 inhibition, FLT3 inhibition in RAS-mutated and CBL-mutated subsets, and immune therapies targeting novel immune checkpoint molecules such as the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4), an immune-modulatory transmembrane protein restrictively expressed on monocytic cells. The successful management of an entity as unique as CMML-BP will require a cooperative, concerted effort to design and conduct clinical trials dedicated to this rare form of sAML.","['(c) 2021.

Despite differences in acuteness between AML and other HMs, the burden of family caregivers (FCs) of patients with these malignancies offer similar patient experiences. A targeted literature review was conducted to explore FC burden of patients with AML and HM with and without hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Instruments to measure and interventions to address FC burden were identified. METHODS: Studies on economic burden and compromised health-related quality of life (HRQoL) associated with FC burden, family affairs, and childcare from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2019 were identified through database and hand searches. Published English articles on randomized controlled trials or standardized qualitative or quantitative observational studies were included. FCs were those in close familial proximity to the patient (i.e., spouse, parents, children, relatives, other family members, significant others). RESULTS: Seventy-one publications were identified (AML, n = 3; HM, n = 29; HSCT, n = 39). Predominant burden categories included humanistic (n = 33), economic (n = 17), and interventions (n = 22); one study was classified as humanistic and economic. FCs lack sufficient resources to manage stressors and experience negative psychological, behavioral, and physiological effects. FCs of patients with HMs reported post-traumatic stress disorder, significant sleep problems, moderate-to-poor HRQoL, and negative impacts on family relationships. Instruments designed to measure caregiver burden were generic and symptom-specific. Educational, expressional, and self-adjustment interventions were used to improve FC burden. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate a need for additional research, public health approaches to support FCs, and effective interventions to address FC burden.

METHODS: GSTM1- and GSTT1-null alleles were genotyped using germline DNA from whole blood prior to a conditioning BU-based regimen. Association of GSTM1- and GSTT1-null variants with relapse incidence was analyzed using multivariable competing risk analysis. BU-induced cell death studies were conducted in GSTs- null and non-null LCLs and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited THP1 leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: Carrying GSTM1/GSTT1 double null genotype was found to be an independent risk factor for post-HSCT relapse in 86 children (adjusted HR: 6.52 [95% Cl, 2.76-15.42; p = 1.9 x 10(-5)]). BU-induced cell death preferentially in THP1(GSTM1(non-null)) and LCLs(GSTM1(non-null)) as shown by decreased viability, increased necrosis and levels of the oxidized form of glutathione compared to null cells, while GSTT1 non-null cells showed increased baseline proliferation. CONCLUSION: The clinical association suggests that GSTM1/GSTT1 double null genotype could serve as genetic stratification biomarker for the high risk of post-HSCT relapse. Functional studies have indicated that GSTM1 status modulates BU-induced cell death. On the other hand, GSTT1 is proposed to be involved in baseline cell proliferation.",['(c) 2021.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) play an important role in inducing host defenses and activating the immune response during microbial infection; however, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in cryptococcal meningitis remain poorly defined. In a previous study, the authors assessed the miRNA profiles of THP1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cells) cells following Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) infection. In the present study, it was found that miR4792 expression was downregulated in BV2 cells infected with C. neoformans, whilst that of its target gene, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), was upregulated. Infected cells in which miR4792 was overexpressed exhibited a decreased EGFR transcript expression, reduced mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and a decreased secretion of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, following antifungal treatment in patients with cryptococcal meningitis, the levels of miR4792 in the cerebrospinal fluid significantly increased, whilst the expression of EGFR significantly decreased. In addition, receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed miR4792 (AUCROC=0.75) and EGFR (AUCROC=0.79) as potential diagnostic markers in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.",,"['Yao, Guotai', 'Wang, Xiaoli', 'Wang, Yan', 'Hou, Qing', 'Gao, Rui', 'Wang, Yilin', 'Teng, Liang', 'Lin, Wenting', 'Wang, Zhongzhi', 'Jin, Yi', 'Chen, Jianghan']","['Yao G', 'Wang X', 'Wang Y', 'Hou Q', 'Gao R', 'Wang Y', 'Teng L', 'Lin W', 'Wang Z', 'Jin Y', 'Chen J']","['Department of Dermatology, Changzheng Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai 200003, P.R.

We conducted an integrative analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data obtained from 12 BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL, AML, and MPAL samples to evaluate its diagnostic utility. RNA-seq facilitated the identification of all p190 BCR-ABL1 with accurate splicing sites and a new gene fusion involving MAP2K2. Most of the clinically significant mutations were also identified including single-nucleotide variations, insertions, and deletions. In addition, RNA-seq yielded differential gene expression profile according to the disease category. Therefore, we selected 368 genes differentially expressed between AML and B-ALL and developed two differential diagnosis models based on the gene expression data using 1) scoring algorithm and 2) machine learning. Both models showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy not only for our 12 BCR-ABL1-positive cases but also for 427 public gene expression datasets from acute leukemias regardless of specific genetic aberration. This is the first trial to develop models of differential diagnosis using RNA-seq, especially to evaluate the potential role of machine learning in identifying the disease category of acute leukemia. The integrative analysis of gene expression data by RNA-seq facilitates the accurate differential diagnosis of acute leukemia with successful detection of significant gene fusion and/or mutations, which warrants further investigation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Lee, Cho, Hong, Kang, Choi, Lee, Yoon, Cho, Lee, Kim, Kim and', 'Kim.']","['Lee, Jaewoong', 'Cho, Sungmin', 'Hong, Seong-Eui', 'Kang, Dain', 'Choi, Hayoung', 'Lee, Jong-Mi', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Kim, Yonggoo']","['Lee J', 'Cho S', 'Hong SE', 'Kang D', 'Choi H', 'Lee JM', 'Yoon JH', 'Cho BS', 'Lee S', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim M', 'Kim Y']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea."", 'Delvine Inc., Seoul, South Korea.', 'Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Division, Theragen Bio Co.

TET2 mutations coexist with other mutations in AML, including TP53 mutations, which can indicate a particularly poor prognosis. Ascorbate can function as an epigenetic therapeutic in pathological contexts involving heterozygous TET2 mutations by restoring TET2 activity. How this response is affected when myeloid leukemia cells harbor mutations in both TET2 and TP53 is unknown. Therefore, we examined the effects of ascorbate on the SKM-1 AML cell line that has mutated TET2 and TP53. Sustained treatment with ascorbate inhibited proliferation and promoted the differentiation of these cells. Furthermore, ascorbate treatment significantly increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, suggesting increased TET activity as the likely mechanism. We also investigated whether ascorbate affected the cytotoxicity of Prima-1(Met), a drug that reactivates some p53 mutants and is currently in clinical trials for AML. We found that the addition of ascorbate had a minimal effect on Prima-1(Met)-induced cytotoxicity, with small increases or decreases in cytotoxicity being observed depending on the timing of treatment. Collectively, these data suggest that ascorbate could exert a beneficial anti-proliferative effect on AML cells harboring both TET2 and TP53 mutations whilst not interfering with targeted cytotoxic therapies such as Prima-1(Met).","['Copyright (c) 2021 Smith-Diaz, Magon, McKenzie, Hampton, Vissers and Das.']","['Smith-Diaz, Carlos C', 'Magon, Nicholas J', 'McKenzie, Judith L', 'Hampton, Mark B', 'Vissers, Margreet C M', 'Das, Andrew B']","['Smith-Diaz CC', 'Magon NJ', 'McKenzie JL', 'Hampton MB', 'Vissers MCM', 'Das AB']","['Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital and Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210823,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['APR-246', 'Prima-1Met', 'TET2', 'ascorbate', 'differentiation', 'epigenetic therapy', 'leukemia', 'vitamin C']",2021/09/10 06:00,2021/09/10 06:01,['2021/09/09 06:52'],"['2021/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/09 06:52 [entrez]', '2021/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.709543 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 23;11:709543. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.709543. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC8419345,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this research is to estimate fungal infection burden and highlight the problem at national and international levels. Methods: Fungal infection burden was estimated using data from epidemiological papers and population at risk and LIFE (Leading International Fungal Education) modelling. Results: The number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) in 2018 was 6193, 29% of them not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Based on 90% and 20% rates of oral and oesophageal candidiasis in patients with CD4 cell count <200 microl(-1) we estimate 808 and 579 patients with oral and oesophageal candidiasis, respectively. The annual incidences of cryptococcal meningitis and Pneumocystis pneumonia are 5 and 55 cases, respectively. We estimated 2307 cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), 4927 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and 6504 with severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS). Using data on chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), lung cancer, acute myeloid leukaemia rates, and number of transplantations, we estimated 693 cases of invasive aspergillosis following these conditions. Using a low-European rate for invasive candidiasis, we estimated 499 and 75 patients with candidemia and intra-abdominal candidiasis respectively. The number of adult women (15-55 years) in Azerbaijan is ~2,658,000, so it was estimated that 159,490 women suffer from recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (rVVC). Discussion: In total, the estimated number of people suffering from fungal diseases in Azerbaijan is 225,974 (2.3% of the population). However, the fungal rate is underestimated due to lack of epidemiological data. The most imminent need is improvement in diagnostic capabilities. This aim should be achieved via establishing a reference laboratory and equipping major clinical centers with essential diagnostics assays.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']","['Huseynov, Ravil M', 'Javadov, Samir S', 'Osmanov, Ali', 'Khasiyev, Shahin', 'Valiyeva, Samira R', 'Almammadova, Esmira', 'Denning, David W']","['Huseynov RM', 'Javadov SS', 'Osmanov A', 'Khasiyev S', 'Valiyeva SR', 'Almammadova E', 'Denning DW']","['The Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Azerbaijan Medical University, Mardanov Qardashlari 98, Baku, Azerbaijan.', 'The Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Azerbaijan Medical University, Baku, Azerbaijan.', 'Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'The Department of Informatics and Statistics, Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan Republic, Baku, Azerbaijan.', 'Republican Centre for Combating AIDS, Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan Republic, Baku, Azerbaijan.', 'Republican Centre for Combating AIDS, Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan Republic, Baku, Azerbaijan.', 'Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210903,England,Ther Adv Infect Dis,Therapeutic advances in infectious disease,101606715,,['NOTNLM'],"['Azerbaijan', 'Pneumocystis pneumonia', 'aspergillosis', 'candidiasis', 'cryptococcal meningitis', 'fungal infections']",2021/09/10 06:00,2021/09/10 06:01,['2021/09/09 06:51'],"['2021/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/09 06:51 [entrez]', '2021/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/20499361211043969 [doi]', '10.1177_20499361211043969 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Infect Dis. 2021 Sep 3;8:20499361211043969. doi: 10.1177/20499361211043969. eCollection 2021 Jan-Dec.,,,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: RMH, SSJ, AO, SK, SRV, and EA declare no', 'conflicts of interest related to this work.

So, we concentrated our effort to introduce a new novel model. Throughout this research, we have studied the properties of its statistical measures of the NEXF distribution. The process of parameter estimation has been studied under a complete sample and Type-I censoring scheme. The numerical simulation is detailed to asses the proposed techniques of estimation. Finally, a Type-I censoring real-life application on leukaemia patient's survival with a new treatment has been studied to illustrate the estimation methods, which are well fitted by the NEXF distribution among all its competitors.

The malignant cell population is composed of multiple clones that evolve over time. Clonal data reflect the mechanisms governing treatment response and relapse. Single cell sequencing provides most direct insights into the clonal composition of the leukemic cells, however it is still not routinely available in clinical practice. In this work we develop a computational algorithm that allows identifying all clonal hierarchies that are compatible with bulk variant allele frequencies measured in a patient sample. The clonal hierarchies represent descendance relations between the different clones and reveal the order in which mutations have been acquired. The proposed computational approach is tested using single cell sequencing data that allow comparing the outcome of the algorithm with the true structure of the clonal hierarchy. We investigate which problems occur during reconstruction of clonal hierarchies from bulk sequencing data. Our results suggest that in many cases only a small number of possible hierarchies fits the bulk data.

Polycomb group ring finger protein 1 (Pcgf1) is a component of PRC1.1, a non-canonical PRC1 that monoubiquitylates H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1). We herein investigated the impact of PRC1.1 insufficiency on myelofibrosis. The deletion of Pcgf1 in JAK2V617F mice strongly promoted the development of lethal myelofibrosis accompanied by a block in erythroid differentiation. Transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequence analyses showed the de-repression of PRC1.1 target genes in Pcgf1-deficient JAK2V617F hematopoietic progenitors and revealed Hoxa cluster genes as direct targets. The deletion of Pcgf1 in JAK2V617F hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), as well as the overexpression of Hoxa9, restored the attenuated proliferation of JAK2V617F progenitors. The overexpression of Hoxa9 also enhanced JAK2V617F-mediated myelofibrosis. The expression of PRC2 target genes identified in PRC2-insufficient JAK2V617F HSPCs was not largely altered in Pcgf1-deleted JAK2V617F HSPCs. The present results revealed a tumor suppressor function for PRC1.1 in myelofibrosis and suggest that PRC1.1 insufficiency has a different impact from that of PRC2 insufficiency on the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis.","['(c) 2021.

MLL fusion proteins, generated by chromosomal translocations, activate a broad range of previously transcribed genes to achieve the same expression profile as that of the parent cell in the daughter cells, thereby promoting self-renewal. Normally, replication of the expression profile only occurs in the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). A transactivation system comprised of MLL and AF4/ENL/P-TEFb (AEP) complexes promotes it by reactivating CpG-rich promoters. In the normal hematopoietic development, this system is tightly regulated and progressively suppressed during the course of hematopoietic differentiation so that non-HSC hematopoietic cells would not self-renew. Genetic mutations such as fusions of MLL and AEP components generate a constitutively active form of the MLL transcriptional machinery, which aberrantly promotes self-renewal even in non-HSC hematopoietic cells. In this review, I depict a molecular mechanism of MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis from a standpoint that leukemogenesis is driven by aberrant self-renewal that is mediated by hyper-active transcriptional machinery, and introduce several molecularly targeted therapies in the making which specifically perturb this transactivation system.",,"['Yokoyama, Akihiko']",['Yokoyama A'],['National Cancer Center Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory.'],['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Molecular therapy', 'Self-renewal', 'Transcriptional machinery']",2021/09/10 06:00,2021/09/11 06:00,['2021/09/09 06:10'],"['2021/09/09 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.62.988 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2021;62(8):988-997. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.62.988.,20210910,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']","['Carcinogenesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/therapy', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics']",8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants is still intractable and difficult to treat as compared with other pediatric ALLs, for which considerable progress in treatment outcomes has been recently achieved. Infant leukemia cells frequently carry chromosome translocations involving the 11q23 locus, resulting in the rearrangement and fusion of the KMT2A (MLL) gene. Among several KMT2A fusion genes, KMT2A-AFF1 (MLL-AF4) fusion is characteristically observed in neonatal and infant ALL, representing a hallmark of poor prognosis.

However, the traditional method cannot accurately evaluate endometrial receptivity. Various studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in multiple processes of embryo implantation, but the role of miRNAs in endometrial receptivity in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the presence of pinopodes and the roles of miR-30d-5p, suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) and the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) pathway in women with a history of RIF during the implantation window. METHODS: Endometrial tissue samples were collected between January 2018 to June 2019 from two groups of women who underwent in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) or frozen ET. The RIF group included 20 women who underwent >/= 3 ETs, including a total of >/= 4 good-quality embryos, without pregnancy, whereas the control group included 10 women who had given birth at least once in the past year. An endometrial biopsy was performed during the implantation window (LH + 7). The development of pinopodes in the endometrial biopsy samples from all groups was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to investigate the expression levels of miR-30d-5p, SOCS1, and the LIF pathway. RESULTS: The presence of developed pinopodes decreased in patients with RIF on LH + 7. The expression level of miR-30d-5p decreased in the endometria during the implantation window of patients with RIF, whereas the mRNA and protein levels of SOCS1 were significantly higher in the RIF group than in the control group. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between the expression of miR-30d-5p and SOCS1 (r(2) = 0.8362). In addition, a significant decrease in LIF and p-STAT3 expression was observed during the implantation window in patients with RIF.

Here, we define the clinico-genomic landscape of TP53 disruptions in 40 patients and employ clonal dynamic modeling to map the mutational hierarchy against clinical outcomes. Most TP53 mutations (45.2%) localized to the L3 loop or LSH motif of the DNA-binding domain. TP53 disruptions had high co-occurrence with mutations in epigenetic regulators, spliceosome machinery, and cohesin complex and low co-occurrence with mutations in proliferative signaling genes. Ancestral and descendant TP53 mutations constituted measurable residual disease and fueled relapse. High mutant TP53 gene dosage predicted low durability of remission. The median overall survival (OS) was 280 days. Hypomethylating agent-based therapy served as an effective bridge to transplant, leading to improved median OS compared to patients who did not receive a transplant (14.7 vs. 5.1 months).

The three compounds were cytotoxic to K562 and Jurkat cells, with IC50 values ranging from 1.03 to 31.66 microM. Chalcones induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, resulting in activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. F07, F09, and F10 were not cytotoxic to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, did not produce any significant hemolytic activity, and did not affect platelet aggregation after ADP stimulation.

Targeting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the treatment of refractory leukemic cells is a potential novel approach to sensitizing tumor cells to existing standard of care therapeutic agents. In the current study, we have expanded our previous investigation of the mitoNEET ligand NL-1 in the treatment of ALL to interrogate the functional role of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein mitoNEET in B-cell ALL. Knockout (KO) of mitoNEET (gene: CISD1) in REH leukemic cells led to changes in mitochondrial ultra-structure and function. REH cells have significantly reduced OXPHOS capacity in the KO cells coincident with reduction in electron flow and increased reactive oxygen species. In addition, we found a decrease in lipid content in KO cells, as compared to the vector control cells was observed. Lastly, the KO of mitoNEET was associated with decreased proliferation as compared to control cells when exposed to the standard of care agent cytarabine (Ara-C). Taken together, these observations suggest that mitoNEET is essential for optimal function of mitochondria in B-cell ALL and may represent a novel anti-leukemic drug target for treatment of minimal residual disease.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In zebrafish, primitive erythropoiesis takes place in the intermediate cell mass region, and definitive erythropoiesis arises from the aorta-gonad mesonephros. TALE-homeoproteins Meis1 and Pbx1 function upstream of GATA1 to specify the erythroid lineage. Embryos lacking Meis1 or Pbx1 have weak gata1 expression and fail to produce primitive erythrocytes. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of how Meis1 and Pbx1 mediate gata1 transcription in erythrocytes remains unclear. Here we show that Hif1alpha acts downstream of Meis1 to mediate gata1 expression in zebrafish embryos. Inhibition of Meis1 expression resulted in suppression of hif1a expression and abrogated primitive erythropoiesis, while injection with in vitro-synthesized hif1alpha mRNA rescued gata1 transcription in Meis1 morphants and recovered their erythropoiesis. Ablation of Hif1alpha expression either by morpholino knockdown or Crispr-Cas9 knockout suppressed gata1 transcription and abrogated primitive erythropoiesis. Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Hif1alpha associates with hypoxia-response elements located in the 3'-flanking region of gata1 during development, suggesting that Hif1alpha regulates gata1 expression in vivo. Together, our results indicate that Meis1, Hif1alpha, and GATA1 indeed comprise a hierarchical regulatory network in which Hif1alpha acts downstream of Meis1 to activate gata1 transcription through direct interactions with its cis-acting elements in primitive erythrocytes.",['(c) 2021 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],"['Chung, Hsin-Yu', 'Lin, Bo-An', 'Lin, Yi-Xuan', 'Chang, Chen-Wei', 'Tzou, Wen-Shyong', 'Pei, Tun-Wen', 'Hu, Chin-Hwa']","['Chung HY', 'Lin BA', 'Lin YX', 'Chang CW', 'Tzou WS', 'Pei TW', 'Hu CH']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Center of Excellence for the Oceans, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Center of Excellence for the Oceans, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Gata1', '*Meis1', '*hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha', '*primitive erythropoiesis', '*regulatory network', '*zebrafish']",2021/09/09 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/09/08 17:32'],"['2021/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/08 17:32 [entrez]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1096/fj.202001044RRR [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2021 Oct;35(10):e21915. doi: 10.1096/fj.202001044RRR.,20211027,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (gata1a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (pbx1a protein, zebrafish)']","['Animals', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/deficiency/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zebrafish/blood/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study analyzed monthly DT within six months after imatinib discontinuation in 131 patients. Monthly DT was calculated as x = ln(2)/K, where x is the DT and K is the fold BCR-ABL1 change from the previous value divided by the number of days between each measurement. The optimal DT value was determined as 12.75 days at two months using a recursive partitioning method. The patients were stratified into three groups: the high-risk group (DT<12.75 days but >0, with rapidly proliferating chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells; n = 26) showed the lowest molecular relapse-free survival (mRFS) of 7.7% at 12 months, compared to 53.6% in the intermediate-risk group (DT>/=12.75 days, with slowly proliferating CML cells; n = 16) or 90.0% in the low-risk group (DT</=0, i.e., without proliferating CML cells; n = 71; P < 0.001).

Patients with DLBCL-RS have poor outcomes with DLBCL-directed therapy; thus, consolidation with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been used, with durable remissions observed. Studies reporting HCT outcomes in patients with DLBCL-RS have been small, have not evaluated the prognostic impact of cytogenetic risk factors, and were conducted prior to the era of novel targeted therapy of CLL/SLL. We performed a Center for International Blood and Transplant Research registry study evaluating outcomes after autologous HCT (auto-HCT; n = 53) and allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT; n = 118) in patients with DLBCL-RS treated in the modern era. More auto-HCT recipients were in complete response (CR) at HCT relative to allo-HCT recipients (66% vs 34%), whereas a higher proportion of allo-HCT recipients had 17p deletion (33% vs 7%) and had previously received novel agents (39% vs 10%). In the auto-HCT cohort, the 3-year relapse incidence, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 37%, 48%, and 57%, respectively. Among allo-HCT recipients, the 3-year relapse incidence, PFS, and OS were 30%, 43%, and 52%, respectively. In the allo-HCT cohort, deeper response at HCT was associated with outcomes (3-year PFS/OS, 66%/77% CR vs 43%/57% partial response vs 5%/15% resistant; P < .0001 for both), whereas cytogenetic abnormalities and prior novel therapy did not impact outcomes.

The proposed algorithm first generates several feature clusters by adopting hierarchical clustering on the feature space and then applies SVD to each of these feature clusters to identify the feature that contributes most to the SVD-entropy. The proposed feature selection method selects an optimal feature subset that not only minimizes the mutual dependency among the selected features but also maximizes mutual dependency of the selected features against their nearest neighbor non-selected features. Each of the selected features also contributes the maximum SVD-entropy among all features of the same feature cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that proposed algorithm performs well against state-of-the-art methods of feature selection in terms of various evaluation criteria. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through analysis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) multi-omics data that consist of five datasets: gene expression, exon expression, methylation, microRNA, and pathway activity dataset (paradigm IPLs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our analysis pinpoints a candidate gene-marker, EREG for AML with an integrative omics evidence.

Micafungin is also a first-line therapeutic option for candidemia and antifungal prophylaxis in a variety of clinical settings. Hypersensitivity reactions have not been well described; however, isolated cases have been reported. No cases of desensitization to echinocandins have been previously described. Case Presentation: In this report, we described a 14-year-old female with high-risk pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis. She developed a hypersensitivity reaction to micafungin, which was deemed first-line therapy for the infection. A rapid intravenous desensitization protocol was successfully completed without reactions. The patient completed the remaining 2 months of therapy without reactions. Conclusion: This report outlines the first report of a successful desensitization to micafungin or any echinocandin.

ERVs can simultaneously promote and restrict XRV infections using mechanisms that are virus and host specific. The majority of endogenous-exogenous retroviral interactions have been evaluated in experimental mouse or chicken systems, which are limited in their ability to extend findings to naturally infected outbred animals. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) has a relatively well-characterized endogenous retrovirus with a coexisting virulent exogenous counterpart and is endemic worldwide in domestic cats. We have previously documented an association between endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) long terminal repeat (LTR) copy number and abrogated exogenous FeLV in naturally infected cats and experimental infections in tissue culture. Analyses described here examine limited FeLV replication in experimentally infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which correlates with higher enFeLV transcripts in these cells compared to fibroblasts. We further examine NCBI Sequence Read Archive RNA transcripts to evaluate enFeLV transcripts and RNA interference (RNAi) precursors. We find that lymphoid-derived tissues, which are experimentally less permissive to exogenous FeLV infection, transcribe higher levels of enFeLV under basal conditions. Transcription of enFeLV-LTR segments is significantly greater than that of other enFeLV genes. We documented transcription of a 21-nucleotide (nt) microRNA (miRNA) just 3' to the enFeLV 5'-LTR in the feline miRNAome of all data sets evaluated (n = 27). Our findings point to important biological functions of enFeLV transcription linked to solo LTRs distributed within the domestic cat genome, with potential impacts on domestic cat exogenous FeLV susceptibility and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are increasingly implicated in host cellular processes and susceptibility to infectious agents, specifically regarding interactions with exogenous retroviral progenitors (XRVs). Exogenous feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and its endogenous counterpart (enFeLV) represent a well-characterized, naturally occurring XRV-ERV dyad. We have previously documented an abrogated FeLV infection in both naturally infected cats and experimental fibroblast infections that harbor higher enFeLV proviral loads. Using an in silico approach, we provide evidence of miRNA transcription that is produced in tissues that are most important for FeLV infection, replication, and transmission. Our findings point to important biological functions of enFeLV transcription linked to solo-LTRs distributed within the feline genome, with potential impacts on domestic cat exogenous FeLV susceptibility and pathogenesis. This body of work provides additional evidence of RNA interference (RNAi) as a mechanism of viral interference and is a demonstration of ERV exaptation by the host to defend against related XRVs.",,"['Chiu, Elliott S', 'McDonald, Coby A', 'VandeWoude, Sue']","['Chiu ES', 'McDonald CA', 'VandeWoude S']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State Universitygrid.47894.36, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State Universitygrid.47894.36, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State Universitygrid.47894.36, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20210908,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*LTR', '*RNA interference', '*RNAi', '*endogenous feline leukemia virus', '*endogenous retrovirus', '*feline leukemia virus', '*long terminal repeat', '*siRNA', '*viral restriction']",2021/09/09 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/09/08 17:15'],"['2022/05/09 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/08 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.00070-21 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2021 Nov 9;95(23):e0007021. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00070-21.

However, because of the complexity of the initial management, early mortality (EM) remains a major contributor to treatment failure. It is less known whether advances in treatment, urgent access to specialized care, and broad availability of ATRA/ATO have reduced EM in the last 2 decades. Furthermore, the influence of sociodemographic factors on the risk of EM also remains unclear. METHODS: This study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to characterize the impact of sociodemographic factors on the rates of EM and overall survival (OS) in patients with APL diagnosed between 1992 and 2015. RESULTS: In all, 2224 cases were identified (895 who were younger than 40 years and 1329 who were 40 years old or older); 47.9% had a county-level median household income of $59,630 or higher, 49.0% belonged to counties where more than 31% of adults held at least a bachelor's degree, and 86.0% resided in urban areas. The rate of EM declined from 31.5% in 1992-1995 to 15.9% in 2012-2015 for all patients. It improved for patients younger than 40 years (27.4% in 1992-1995 vs 5.4% in 2012-2015; P < .001) and for patients 40 years old or older but not to the same extent (35.2% in 1992-1995 vs 22.2% in 2012-2015; P = .02). Importantly, improvements in EM were not seen among patients residing in rural areas, with the rate remaining higher than 20% in 2012-2015. The 3-year OS rate was 49.2% for patients with APL diagnosed in 1992-1995 and 76.4% for patients diagnosed in 2012-2015. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm consistent improvements in EM and OS for patients with APL and point to the challenge of further extending these improvements in EM rates to older patients and to those living in rural areas.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['Jamy, Omer H', 'Dhir, Aditi', 'Costa, Luciano J', 'Xavier, Ana C']","['Jamy OH', 'Dhir A', 'Costa LJ', 'Xavier AC']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210908,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'early mortality', 'health care disparity', 'sociodemographic factors', 'survival']",2021/09/09 06:00,2021/09/09 06:00,['2021/09/08 12:32'],"['2021/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/08 12:32 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33914 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2022 Jan 15;128(2):292-298. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33914.

Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) is an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor that is expressed on myeloid cells; the interaction between SIRPalpha and its ubiquitously expressed ligand CD47 elicits an inhibitory signal that suppresses macrophage phagocytic function. Additional studies showed that donor-recipient mismatch in SIRPalpha variants might activate monocytic allorecognition, possibly as the result of non-self SIRPalpha-CD47 interaction. However, the frequency of SIRPalpha variation and its role in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains unexplored. We studied 350 patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent HLA-matched related HSCT and found that SIRPalpha allelic mismatches were present in 39% of transplantation pairs. SIRPalpha variant mismatch was associated with a significantly higher rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; P = .03), especially de novo chronic GVHD (HR, 2.0; P = .01), after adjusting for other predictors. Those with mismatched SIRPalpha had a lower relapse rate (HR, 0.6; P = .05) and significantly longer relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 0.6; P = .04). Notably, the effect of SIRPalpha variant mismatch on relapse protection was most pronounced early after HSCT and in patients who were not in remission at HSCT (cumulative incidence, 73% vs 54%; HR, 0.5; P = .01). These findings show that SIRPalpha variant mismatch is associated with HSCT outcomes, possibly owing to innate allorecognition. SIRPalpha variant matching could provide valuable information for donor selection and risk stratification in HSCT.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Saliba, Rima M', 'Greenbaum, Uri', 'Ma, Qing', 'Srour, Samer A', 'Carmazzi, Yudith', 'Li, Liang', 'Oran, Betul', 'Moller, Michael', 'Wood, Janet', 'Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Partlow, David', 'Li, Dan', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Cao, Kai', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Zou, Jun']","['Saliba RM', 'Greenbaum U', 'Ma Q', 'Srour SA', 'Carmazzi Y', 'Li L', 'Oran B', 'Moller M', 'Wood J', 'Ciurea SO', 'Kongtim P', 'Rondon G', 'Partlow D', 'Li D', 'Rezvani K', 'Shpall EJ', 'Cao K', 'Champlin RE', 'Zou J']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Division of Pathology/Laboratory Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Department of Biostatistics.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Division of Pathology/Laboratory Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Division of Pathology/Laboratory Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Division of Pathology/Laboratory Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/09/09 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/09/08 12:24'],"['2021/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/08 12:24 [entrez]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00497-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004307 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Sep 14;5(17):3407-3417. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004307.,20210913,,"['*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes']",17,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7314-0790', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8597-3271', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8303-406X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4314-5037', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0112-5118']",,PMC8525235,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Sixty-five patients, aged 11.2+/-3.5 years, mostly males (50.8%) and white (90.8%), with high incidence of hematological cancers (81.5%) participated in the study. The performance in the 6MWT was 23.1% inferior comparing the mean predicted and achieved (584.3+/-5 and 447.7+/-78.6 m, respectively).

MGA and MAX are also members of the polycomb repressive complex, ncPRC1.6. Here, we use genetically modified MAX-deficient small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells and carry out genome-wide and proteomics analyses to study the tumor suppressor function of MAX. We find that MAX mutant SCLCs have ASCL1 or NEUROD1 or combined ASCL1/NEUROD1 characteristics and lack MYC transcriptional activity. MAX restitution triggers prodifferentiation expression profiles that shift when MAX and oncogenic MYC are coexpressed. Although ncPRC1.6 can be formed, the lack of MAX restricts global MGA occupancy, selectively driving its recruitment toward E2F6-binding motifs. Conversely, MAX restitution enhances MGA occupancy to repress genes involved in different functions, including stem cell and DNA repair/replication. Collectively, these findings reveal that MAX mutant SCLCs have either ASCL1 or NEUROD1 or combined characteristics and are MYC independent and exhibit deficient ncPRC1.6-mediated gene repression.",,"['Llabata, Paula', 'Torres-Diz, Manuel', 'Gomez, Antonio', 'Tomas-Daza, Laureano', 'Romero, Octavio A', 'Grego-Bessa, Joaquim', 'Llinas-Arias, Pere', 'Valencia, Alfonso', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Javierre, Biola M', 'Zhang, Xiaoyang', 'Sanchez-Cespedes, Montse']","['Llabata P', 'Torres-Diz M', 'Gomez A', 'Tomas-Daza L', 'Romero OA', 'Grego-Bessa J', 'Llinas-Arias P', 'Valencia A', 'Esteller M', 'Javierre BM', 'Zhang X', 'Sanchez-Cespedes M']","['Cancer Genetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, 08908 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Rheumatology Research Group, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, 08035 Barcelona, Spain."", '3D Chromatin Organization Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Genetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, 08908 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Computational Biology Life Sciences Group, Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, 08034 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, 08010 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona, 08907 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Rheumatology Research Group, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, 08035 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.', 'Cancer Genetics Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, 08916 Barcelona, Spain; mscespedes@carrerasresearch.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*MAX', '*MGA', '*SCLC', '*ncPRC1.6', '*tumor suppressor']",2021/09/09 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/09/08 06:15'],"['2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2022/03/07 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/09/08 06:15 [entrez]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2024824118 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2024824118 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Sep 14;118(37). pii: 2024824118. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2024824118.,20211213,"['0 (ASCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (MGA protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NEUROD1 protein, human)', '0 (PRC1 protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']","['Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",37,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7733-6475', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5487-8113', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5308-981X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6127-1694', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0229-6530', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0938-2346', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4490-6093', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8682-6748', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0031-0290', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6045-5627']",,PMC8449313,,,['2022/03/07 00:00'],,,,,,,

Therefore, an automated optical image processing system is required to support the clinical decision-making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood smear slides (n = 250) were prepared from clinical samples, imaged and analyzed in Jimma Medical Center, Hematology department. Samples were collected, analyzed and preserved from out and in-patients. The system was able to categorize four common types of leukemia's such as acute and chronic myeloid leukemia; and acute and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, through a robust image segmentation protocol, followed by classification using the support vector machine. RESULTS: The system was able to classify leukemia types with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of 97.69%, 97.86% and 100%, respectively for the test datasets, and 97.5%, 98.55% and 100%, respectively, for the validation datasets. In addition, the system also showed an accuracy of 94.75% for the WBC counts that include both lymphocytes and monocytes. The computer-assisted diagnosis system took less than one minute for processing and assigning the leukemia types, compared to an average period of 30 minutes by unassisted manual approaches. Moreover, the automated system complements the healthcare workers' in their efforts, by improving the accuracy rates in diagnosis from approximately 70% to over 97%. CONCLUSION: Importantly, our module is designed to assist the healthcare facilities in the rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, equipped with fewer experienced medical experts, especially in screening patients for blood associated diseases including leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of CD9 expression is controversial. Therefore, the current meta-analysis was conducted to determine the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of CD9 expression in cancer patients. METHODS: Eligible studies were selected through database search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library up to April 5 2020. The necessary data were extracted from the included studies. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of CD9 expression in cancer patients. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies consisting of 3456 cancer patients were included in this meta-analysis. An increased CD9 expression was significantly associated with a more favorable overall survival (OS) (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.73, p = 0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.79, p = 0.003). In subgroup analysis of cancer type, an increased CD9 expression was associated with increased OS in breast cancer and digestive system cancer, and with increased DFS in head and neck cancer and leukemia/lymphoma.

There are not comprehensive details about immunosuppressive properties of chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived exosomes in the bone marrow stromal and immune compartment. We explained here that K562-derived exosomes could affect the gene expression, cytokine secretion, nitric oxide (NO) production, and redox potential of human primary cord blood-derived T cells (CB T cells). METHODS: Human primary cord blood-derived T cells were treated with K562-derived exosomes. We evaluated the expression variation of some critical genes activated in suppressor T cells. The alterations of some inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines levels were assessed using ELISA assay and real-time PCR. Finally, NO production and intracellular ROS level in CB T cells were evaluated using Greiss assay and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: Our results showed the over-expression of the genes involved in inhibitory T cells, including NQO1, PD1, and FoxP3. In contrast, genes involved in T cell activation such as CD3d and NFATc3 have been reduced significantly. Also, the expression of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in these cells upon exosome treatment. In addition, secretion of the interleukin 10, interleukin 6, and interleukin 17 (IL-17) proteins increased in T cells exposed to K562-derived exosomes. Finally, K562-derived exosomes induce significant changes in the NO production and intracellular ROS levels in CB T cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that K562-derived exosomes stimulate the immunosuppressive properties in CB-derived T cells by inducing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, reducting ROS levels, and arising of NO synthesis in these cells. Moreover, considering the elevation of FOXP3, IL-6, and IL-17 levels in these cells, exosomes secreted by CML cells may induce the fates of T cells toward tumor favorable T cells instead of conventional activated T cells.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: English-speaking parents of patients 4 to <18 years who were receiving ALL maintenance oral chemotherapy were eligible to participate in this mixed methods study. Using semi-structured interviews, we asked participants how difficult they found oral chemotherapy administration. We also probed regarding barriers and facilitators of oral chemotherapy administration and strategies used to overcome challenges. Lastly, we asked participants for their advice to future parents giving oral chemotherapy to their children. RESULTS: Twenty-three participants were interviewed. One-fifth of participants stated that oral chemotherapy administration at home was hard or very hard. Common factors influencing oral chemotherapy administration were product-related (e.g., formulation) and treatment-related adverse effects (e.g., nausea), lifestyle adjustment (e.g., fitting in with family schedule), and attitudes (e.g., onus of medication administration). Strategies to address oral chemotherapy administration included several administration techniques, scheduling of medication administration, and normalization of medication taking.

Due to the heterogeneity of concomitant lesions, it remains unclear how IKZF1 abnormalities directly affect cell function and therapy resistance, and whether their consideration as a prognostic indicator is valuable in improving outcome. CRISPR/Cas9 strategies were used to engineer multiple panels of isogeneic lymphoid leukemia cell lines with a spectrum of IKZF1 lesions to measure changes in chemosensitivity, gene expression, cell cycle, and in vivo engraftment that can be linked to loss of IKAROS protein. IKZF1 knockout and heterozygous null cells displayed relative resistance to a number of common therapies for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, including dexamethasone, asparaginase, and daunorubicin. Transcription profiling revealed a stem/myeloid cell-like phenotype and JAK/STAT upregulation after IKAROS loss. A CRISPR homology-directed repair strategy was also used to knock-in the dominant-negative IK6 isoform into the endogenous locus, and a similar drug resistance profile, with the exception of retained dexamethasone sensitivity, was observed. Interestingly, IKZF1 knockout and IK6 knock-in cells both have significantly increased sensitivity to cytarabine, likely owing to marked downregulation of SAMHD1 after IKZF1 knockout. Both types of IKZF1 lesions decreased the survival time of xenograft mice, with higher numbers of circulating blasts and increased organ infiltration. Given these findings, exact specification of IKZF1 status in patients may be a beneficial addition to risk stratification and could inform therapy.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Rogers, Jason H', 'Gupta, Rohit', 'Reyes, Jaime M', 'Gundry, Michael C', 'Medrano, Geraldo', 'Guzman, Anna', 'Aguilar, Rogelio', 'Conneely, Shannon E', 'Song, Tidie', 'Johnson, Cade', 'Barnes, Sean', 'Cristobal, Carlo D D', 'Kurtz, Kristen', 'Brunetti, Lorenzo', 'Goodell, Margaret A', 'Rau, Rachel E']","['Rogers JH', 'Gupta R', 'Reyes JM', 'Gundry MC', 'Medrano G', 'Guzman A', 'Aguilar R', 'Conneely SE', 'Song T', 'Johnson C', 'Barnes S', 'Cristobal CDD', 'Kurtz K', 'Brunetti L', 'Goodell MA', 'Rau RE']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Department of Medicine.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center.', 'Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Dan L.

We evaluated dasatinib and dexamethasone induction then protocol-defined post-remission therapies, including hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Adults (N = 65) with Ph-positive ALL received dasatinib-dexamethasone induction, methotrexate-based central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy alone, and dasatinib-based maintenance. Key end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The median age was 60 years (range, 22-87 years). The complete remission rate was 98.5%. With a median follow-up of 59 months, 5-year DFS and OS were 37% (median, 30 months) and 48% (median, 56 months), respectively. For patients receiving RIC allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy, 5-year DFS were 49%, 29%, and 34%, and 5-year OS were 62%, 57%, and 46%, respectively. Complete molecular response rate after CNS prophylaxis was 40%. Relative to the p190 isoform, p210 had shorter DFS (median 10 vs 34 months, P = .002) and OS (median 16 months vs not reached, P = .05). Relapse occurred in 25% of allogeneic HCT, 57% of autologous HCT, and 36% of chemotherapy patients. T315I mutation was detected in 6 of 8 marrow relapses. Dasatinib CNS concentrations were low. Dasatinib-dexamethasone followed by RIC allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy was feasible and efficacious, especially with RIC allogeneic HCT. Future studies should address the major causes of failure: T315I mutation, the p210 BCR-ABL1 isoform, and CNS relapse.

The aim of our work was to determine the prognostic value of the signs of antigen selection determined by BASELINe statistics in M IGHV sequences of CLL patients. Clinical data, IGHV gene configuration, TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1 mutations were analyzed in 127 CLL patients with M IGHV sequences. The median OS of patients with negative selection in the framework regions (FWRs) of IGHV genes was 120 months compared to 202 month in other CLL patients (P = 0.016). In multivariate Cox regression analysis Binet stage C vs A + B (P < 0.0001), SF3B1 mutations (P < 0.0001), negative selection in the FWRs (HR P = 0.007), and age >/=65 years (P = 0.034) were powerful adverse prognostic factors for OS in CLL patients with M IGHV genes.

There is limited data on the prognosis and of CLL in this region. METHODS: This was a retrospective study (2009-2020) of consecutively diagnosed patients with CLL at Kuwait Cancer Center. The diagnosis, prognosis, treatment indication, response criteria, and adverse events were recorded per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 219 patients with CLL were enrolled in the study. The crude annual incidence is 0.4 per 100,000. The median follow-up was 120 months. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years, and 32 % of patients with CLL were </= 55 years of age. Prognostic fluorescence in situ hybridization data were available in 213 cases. del (13q14/13q34) was found in 80 (31 %) cases, del (11q) in 23 (10.7 %) cases, del (17p) in 11 (5.16 %) cases, and trisomy 12 in 46 (21.5 %) cases. IGHV mutation status was available in 92 cases, 45 of which (48.9) were mutated and 47 (51.1 %) of which were not. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for the entire cohort was 178 months [95 % CI: 145-NE].. The median OS was 203 months [95 % CI: 145-NE]. The median PFS for the IGHV mutated cases was not reached [95 % CI: 178 - NE]; while the median PFS for the unmutated CLL cases was 24 months [95 % CI: 124 - NE].

Questions on how aberrant expression of HDACs contributes to the formation of hematologic malignancies are also responded, because these classes of enzymes have a respectable share in the development, progression, and recurrence of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The last section provides a special focus on the therapeutic perspectiveof HDACs inhibitors, either as single agents or in a combined-modal strategy, in these neoplasms.

In this report, we describe an acute lymphoblastic leukemia case with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) encompassing the entire HLA. METHODS: HLA molecular typing was performed on peripheral blood (PB) and buccal swabs (BS). Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) was performed using a whole genome platform. RESULTS: Typing results on PB sample collected during blast crisis demonstrated homozygosity at the-B,-C,-DR, and -DP loci. A BS sample demonstrated heterozygosity at the above loci. A subsequent PB sample drawn after count recovery confirmed heterozygosity. The CMA performed on PB samples collected during blast crisis revealed a large terminal region of copy-neutral LOH involving chromosome region 6p25.3p21.31, spanning approximately 33.32 Mb. The results of the CMA assay on sample collected after count recovery did not demonstrate LOH. CONCLUSIONS: LOH at the HLA gene locus may significantly influence the donor search resulting in mistakenly choosing homozygous donors.

Recently, a series of mutations in the multifunctional dNTP triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase), sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), have been reported in various cancers. Here, we investigated the structure and functions of SAMHD1 R366C/H mutants, found in colon cancer and leukemia. Unlike many other cancer-specific mutations, the SAMHD1 R366 mutations do not alter cellular protein levels of the enzyme. However, R366C/H mutant proteins exhibit a loss of dNTPase activity, and their X-ray structures demonstrate the absence of dGTP substrate in their active site, likely because of a loss of interaction with the gamma-phosphate of the substrate. The R366C/H mutants failed to reduce intracellular dNTP levels and restrict HIV-1 replication, functions of SAMHD1 that are dependent on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze dNTPs. However, these mutants retain dNTPase-independent functions, including mediating dsDNA break repair, interacting with CtIP and cyclin A2, and suppressing innate immune responses. Finally, SAMHD1 degradation in human primary-activated/dividing CD4+ T cells further elevates cellular dNTP levels. This study suggests that the loss of SAMHD1 dNTPase activity induced by R366 mutations can mechanistically contribute to the elevated dNTP levels commonly found in cancer cells.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Inhibition of dynamin, a GTPase involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and regulation of the cell cycle, has been proposed as a potential anti-cancer regimen, but the effects of dynamin inhibition on leukemia cells has not been extensively addressed. Here we adopted single cell and whole-population analysis by flow cytometry and live imaging, to assess the effect of dynamin inhibition (Dynasore, Dyngo-4a, MitMAB) on pediatric acute leukemia cell lines (CCRF-CEM and THP-1), human bone marrow biopsies from patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as well as in a model of lymphoma (EL4)-induced tumor growth in mice. All inhibitors suppressed proliferation and induced pronounced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in CCRF-CEM and THP-1 cell lines. However, the inhibitors showed no effect on bone marrow biopsies, and did not prevent EL4-induced tumor formation in mice. We conclude that dynamin inhibition affects highly proliferating human leukemia cells.

It is independently associated with poor outcome. As it can only be reliably detected by expression profiling, it is difficult to diagnose with routine methods. Its recognition has become of greater importance due to prognostication and even more due to the new diagnostic options given by targeted therapies. There is still no standardized diagnostic test enabling its prompt recognition. Here, we introduce our approach how to detect it by combination of widely available techniques. METHODS: 179 ALL patients diagnosed in our center during the last 8 years were included. Data on immunophenotype and cytogenetics were used to select patients with potentially Ph-like ALL (65/179). CRLF2 gene rearrangement (CRLF2-r) was tested by FISH in 59/65 patients, and next-generation sequencing was done by Archer FusionPlex ALL kit in 34 patients. TSLPR expression was determined in 20 patients. RESULTS: Philadelphia chromosome-like aberrations were confirmed in 9 patients. In 10% of tested samples, CRLF2-r was confirmed. Due to a lack of material, NGS was done only in a half of potentially Ph-like cases. In 10%, other Ph-like fusions were found by NGS. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained frequencies, and genetic and patients' characteristics are in concordance with the literature data, ensuring a reliable detection of this challenging ALL subtype. The proposed algorithm allows detection of Ph-like ALL at reasonable cost and acceptable workload.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Podgornik, Helena', 'Doplihar Kebe, Ana', 'Klun, Jurka', 'Rebersek, Katarina', 'Sucurovic, Sandra', 'Skerget, Matevz', 'Zver, Samo']","['Podgornik H', 'Doplihar Kebe A', 'Klun J', 'Rebersek K', 'Sucurovic S', 'Skerget M', 'Zver S']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Medical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210907,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CRLF2 rearrangement', 'FISH', 'NGS', 'Ph-like ALL']",2021/09/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2021/09/07 12:50'],"['2021/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/07 12:50 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13698 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2022 Feb;44(1):142-149. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13698.

Therefore, the current study focused on analyzing the ALDH1A1-overexpressing microarray data for CP resistance and CP-sensitive CML cell lines. In this study, the microarray dataset was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus GEO. The GEO2R tool was used to identify Differentially Expressing Genes (DEGs). Further, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs were constructed using STRING database. Finally, Hub gene-miRNA-TFs interaction were constructed using miRNet tool. A total of 749 DEGs including 387 upregulated and 225 downregulated genes were identified from this pool of microarray data. The construction of DEGs network resulted in identification of three genes including ZEB2, EZH2, and MUC1 were found to be majorly responsible for ALDH1A1 overexpression. miRNA analysis identified that, hsa-mir-16-5p and hsa-mir-26a-5p as hub miRNA which are commonly interacting with maximum target genes. Additionally, drug-gene interaction analysis was performed to identify drugs which are responsible for ALDH1A1 expression. The entire study may provide a deeper understanding about ALDH1A1 regulatory genes responsible for its overexpression in CP resistance cancer. This understanding may be further explore for developing possible co-therapy to avoid the ALDH1A1-mediated CP resistance.","['(c) 2021.

Functional outcomes after discontinuing tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment have not been described. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of social, physical, cognitive, and sexual function were assessed over 36 months in 172 adult patients with chronic phase CML from 14 sites at baseline (on TKI) and after discontinuation. Linear mixed-effects models described the average trajectories for each patient-reported outcome measure after discontinuation and in those who restarted TKI. Of 112 patients in TFR at 12 months, 103 (92.0%) had a 3-point or greater improvement in social function, 80 (71.4%) in social isolation, 11 (9.8%) in satisfaction with sex life, 4 (3.6%) in physical function, and no patients had a 3-point or greater improvement in cognitive function or interest in sexual activity. Patients' scores worsened after restarting TKI. This novel information on functional outcomes in TFR can help guide patient and clinician decision making.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.
