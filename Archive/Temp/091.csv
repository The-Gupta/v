In case-control studies, participation among cases is usually higher than among controls due to the personal relevance. In Australia, between 2003 and 2011, we conducted three national population-based case-control studies of risk factors for childhood cancers; brain tumors, acute leukemia and neuroblastoma and Wilms' tumor. In this sub-study, we aimed to investigate factors that may have influenced study participation and completeness of survey completion. FINDINGS: The proportion of incident cases that were eligible to participate was lowest in the brain tumor study (Aus-CBT) (83.1%), as was the proportion of eligible families that consented (57%). The percentage of eligible cases that consented was highest in the leukemia study (Aus-ALL) (80.2%). The mode of invitation used was associated with families' consent in each of the studies. Families invited in person, at clinic appointments, were more likely to consent than families invited by letter or phone. Timing of invitation following the child's diagnosis differed among studies but, the likelihood of consent did not appear to be directly related to this. The return of questionnaires, completion of interview, and provision of DNA (blood sample) was highest in Aus-ALL (93%) and lowest in Aus-CBT (81%). CONCLUSIONS: Studies of childhood cancer, and possibly other childhood diseases, should arrange for the family to be invited in person and, where possible, by a doctor with whom they are familiar. Whilst telephone interviews are time consuming and costly, particularly for large studies, they should be preferred over questionnaires for obtaining complete data.","['Heiden, Tamika L', 'Bailey, Helen D', 'Armstrong, Bruce K', 'Milne, Elizabeth']","['Heiden TL', 'Bailey HD', 'Armstrong BK', 'Milne E']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, PO Box 855, West Perth WA 6872, Australia. theiden@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130508,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Patient Selection']",PMC3658929,2013/05/10 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-0500-6-191 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-6-191 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2013 May 8;6:191. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-6-191.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively investigated the prognostic impact of NPM1mut-based minimal residual disease detection from bone marrow for development of relapse by using a newly developed real-time polymerase chain reaction based on locked nucleic acid-containing primers in 174 patients, 155 of whom were treated within prospective protocols. The prognostic value of 5 cutoff values after completion of treatment or after allogeneic transplantation was studied by using cause-specific hazard models. Subsequent validation using cross-validated partial likelihood analysis revealed that an increase of more than 1% NPM1mut/ABL1 was most prognostic for relapse after chemotherapy, whereas an increase of more than 10% NPM1mut/ABL1 was most prognostic for relapse after allogeneic transplantation. Univariate and multivariate analysis of disease-free survival and overall survival revealed a significantly worse outcome in patients with >1% NPM1mut/ABL1 and >10% NPM1mut/ABL1, respectively, which remained significant after adjustment for FLT3-internal tandem duplication status. Our results in a large data set define and optimize cutoff values for early diagnosis of molecular relapse. These results may be especially important for defining triggers for early therapeutic intervention.","['Shayegi, Nona', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Heiderich, Caroline', 'Landt, Olfert', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Thiede, Christian']","['Shayegi N', 'Kramer M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schaich M', 'Schetelig J', 'Platzbecker U', 'Rollig C', 'Heiderich C', 'Landt O', 'Ehninger G', 'Thiede C']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130508,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,2013/05/10 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/05/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57206-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-10-461749 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jul 4;122(1):83-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-10-461749.

FICZ and its metabolites have been detected in human fluids. We recently reported that AhR promotes retinoic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells by restricting the nuclear abundance of the stem cell associated transcription factor Oct4. The standard clinical management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is differentiation induction therapy using RA. But RA is not effective for other myeloid leukemias, making the mechanism of RA-induced differentiation observed in a non-APL myeloid leukemia of interest. To our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the influence of FICZ on RA-induced differentiation in any type of leukemic blasts. METHODS: Using flow cytometry and Western blotting assays, we determined the effects of FICZ on RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 human leukemia cells. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The groups RA and FICZ + RA were compared using the Paired-Samples T-Test. Western blot figures present the typical blots. RESULTS: We demonstrate that FICZ enhances RA-induced differentiation, assessed by the expression of the membrane differentiation marker CD11b; cell cycle arrest; and the functional differentiation marker, inducible-oxidative metabolism. FICZ causes changes in signaling events that are known to drive differentiation, and notably augments the RA-induced sustained activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK axis of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. FICZ also augments expression of the known MAPK signaling regulatory molecules c-Cbl, VAV1, pY458 p85 PI3K, Src-family kinases (SFKs), and IRF-1, a transcription factor associated with this putative signalsome that promotes RA-induced differentiation. Moreover, FICZ in combination with RA also increases expression of AhR and even more so of both Cyp1A2 and p47phox, which are known to be transcriptionally regulated by AhR. pY1021 PDGFRbeta, a marker associated with retinoic acid syndrome was also increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that FICZ modulates intracellular signaling pathways and enhances RA-induced differentiation.","['Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Bunaciu RP', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,IM,"['Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC3693992,2013/05/10 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-39 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-39 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 May 9;12:39. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-39.,,,"['0 (6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ES cells were derived from embryos produced by in vitro fertilisation (iESC), parthenogenesis (pESC) and hand-made cloning (cESC). The expression of WNT3A, its receptors and intermediate signalling pathways were found to be conserved in ES cells derived from the three different sources. WNT3A was expressed in ES cells but not in embryoid bodies derived from iESC or in buffalo fetal fibroblast cells. It was revealed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis that following supplementation of culture medium with WNT3A (100, 200 or 400ngmL(-1)) a significant increase (P<0.05) was observed in the expression level of beta-CATENIN, which indicated the activation of the canonical WNT pathway. WNT3A, in combination with exogenous fibroblast growth factor-2 and leukaemia inhibitory factor, induced proliferation of undifferentiated ES cells. Differentiation studies showed that WNT3A caused formation of scaffold-like structures and inhibition of differentiation into neuron-like cells. In conclusion, the WNT3A signalling pathway is necessary both for maintaining undifferentiated buffalo ES cells as well as for directing their differentiation.","['Zandi, Mohammad', 'Muzaffar, Musharifa', 'Shah, Syed Mohmad', 'Kaushik, Ramakant', 'Singh, Manoj Kumar', 'Palta, Prabhat', 'Singla, Suresh Kumar', 'Manik, Radhey Sham', 'Chauhan, Manmohan Singh']","['Zandi M', 'Muzaffar M', 'Shah SM', 'Kaushik R', 'Singh MK', 'Palta P', 'Singla SK', 'Manik RS', 'Chauhan MS']","['Department of Animal and Poultry Science and Fisheries, Agricultural Institute, Iranian Research Organisation for Science and Technology, Tehran 33535111, Iran.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,IM,"['Animals', 'Buffaloes/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Wnt/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Wnt3A Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,2013/05/10 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['RD13084 [pii]', '10.1071/RD13084 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2014;26(4):551-61. doi: 10.1071/RD13084.,4,,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Wnt)', '0 (Wnt3A Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these cancers are chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and atypical (BCR-ABL1-negative) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), both of which are diagnosed on the basis of neoplastic expansion of granulocytic cells and exclusion of genetic drivers that are known to occur in other myeloproliferative neoplasms and myeloproliferative-myelodysplastic overlap neoplasms. METHODS: To identify potential genetic drivers in these disorders, we used an integrated approach of deep sequencing coupled with the screening of primary leukemia cells obtained from patients with CNL or atypical CML against panels of tyrosine kinase-specific small interfering RNAs or small-molecule kinase inhibitors. We validated candidate oncogenes using in vitro transformation assays, and drug sensitivities were validated with the use of assays of primary-cell colonies. RESULTS: We identified activating mutations in the gene encoding the receptor for colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3R) in 16 of 27 patients (59%) with CNL or atypical CML. These mutations segregate within two distinct regions of CSF3R and lead to preferential downstream kinase signaling through SRC family-TNK2 or JAK kinases and differential sensitivity to kinase inhibitors. A patient with CNL carrying a JAK-activating CSF3R mutation had marked clinical improvement after the administration of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in CSF3R are common in patients with CNL or atypical CML and represent a potentially useful criterion for diagnosing these neoplasms.

Thus, even the best candidate driver genes display low mutational rates compared to other tumors. This means that a large percentage of cases do not display clear tumor-driving point mutations, or show candidate driving point mutations with no obvious biochemical relationship to the more frequently mutated genes. This genomic landscape probably reflects either an unknown underlying biochemical mechanism playing a key role in CLL or multiple biochemical pathways independently driving the development of this tumor. The elucidation of either scenario will have important consequences on the clinical management of CLL. Herein, we review the recent advances in the definition of the genomic landscape of CLL and the ongoing research to characterize the underlying biochemical events that drive this disease.","['Quesada, Victor', 'Ramsay, Andrew J', 'Rodriguez, David', 'Puente, Xose S', 'Campo, Elias', 'Lopez-Otin, Carlos']","['Quesada V', 'Ramsay AJ', 'Rodriguez D', 'Puente XS', 'Campo E', 'Lopez-Otin C']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Universidad de Oviedo - IUOPA, Oviedo, Spain. quesadavictor@uniovi.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130509,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,IM,"['Biomedical Research/trends', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Point Mutation']",PMC3655884,2013/05/10 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/05/10 06:00'],"['2013/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1741-7015-11-124 [pii]', '10.1186/1741-7015-11-124 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2013 May 9;11:124. doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-11-124.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, research on men's sexuality post-cancer has focused almost exclusively on those with prostate and testicular cancer, despite evidence that the diagnosis and treatment for most cancers can impact on men's sexuality. This Australian qualitative study explores the experiences of changes to sexuality for 21 men across a range of cancer types and stages, sexual orientations and relationship contexts. Semi-structured interviews were analysed with theoretical thematic analysis guided by a material discursive intra-psychic approach, recognising the materiality of sexual changes, men's intrapsychic experience of such changes within a relational context and the influence of the discursive construction of masculine sexuality. Material changes included erectile difficulty, decreased desire, and difficulty with orgasm. The use of medical aids to minimise the impact of erectile difficulties was shaped by discursive constructions of 'normal' masculine sexuality. The majority of men reported accepting the changes to their sexuality post-cancer and normalised them as part of the natural ageing process. Men's relationship status and context played a key role managing the changes to their sexuality. We conclude by discussing the implications for clinical practice.","['Gilbert, Emilee', 'Ussher, Jane M', 'Perz, Janette', 'Wong, W K Tim', 'Hobbs, Kim', 'Mason, Catherine']","['Gilbert E', 'Ussher JM', 'Perz J', 'Wong WK', 'Hobbs K', 'Mason C']","['a Centre for Health Research , University of Western Sydney , Sydney , Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130508,England,Cult Health Sex,"Culture, health & sexuality",100883416,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Australia', 'Brain Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Erectile Dysfunction/etiology/*psychology/therapy', 'Heterosexuality', 'Homosexuality, Male', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Leukemia/psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Masculinity', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/psychology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Qualitative Research', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/etiology/psychology/therapy', 'Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological/*psychology', 'Sexuality/*psychology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,2013/05/10 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/05/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13691058.2013.789129 [doi]'],ppublish,Cult Health Sex. 2013;15(8):881-95. doi: 10.1080/13691058.2013.789129.

The demonstration that minimal residual disease (MRD) is the strongest overall prognostic indicator and can identify patients who are unlikely to be cured by standard chemotherapy has added a powerful new factor to consider when making this decision. There is substantial data indicating that the likelihood of relapse after transplant is directly correlated with levels of MRD before transplant. This knowledge can be used to adjust the timing of HSCT, and guide the selection of donor, conditioning regimen, and post-HSCT strategies to maximize the graft-versus-leukaemia effect. Because MRD emerging post-transplant carries a dire prognosis, its detection can trigger withdrawal of immunosuppression, additional cellular and molecular therapies, or preparations for a second HSCT. Although it is not yet clear whether any of these actions will significantly improve outcome, it is likely that they will be most effective for patients with a relatively low tumour burden, who can be identified only through MRD testing.

Genetic polymorphisms in the 3'UTR region of the CXCL12 (rs1801157) and TP53 codon 72 (rs1042522) genes may contribute to susceptibility to childhood ALL because they affect some important processes, such as metastasis regulation and tumor suppression. Thus the objective of the present study was to detect the frequency of two genetic polymorphisms in ALL patients and controls and to add information their impact on genetic susceptibility and prognosis. The CXCL12 and TP53 polymorphisms were tested in 54 ALL child patients and in 58 controls by restriction fragment length polymerase chain reaction and allelic specific chain reaction techniques, respectively. The frequencies of both allelic variants were higher in ALL patients than in the controls and indicated a positive association: OR = 2.44; 95 % CI 1.05-5.64 for CXCL12 and OR = 2.20; 95 % CI 1.03-4.70 for TP53. Furthermore, when the two genetic variants were analyzed together, they increased significantly more than fivefold the risk of this neoplasia development (OR = 5.24; 95 % CI 1.39-19.75), indicating their potential as susceptibility markers for ALL disease and the relevance of the allelic variant combination to increased risk of developing malignant tumors.

The aetiology is unknown, but might relate to an unidentified virus or immune dysregulation. There are few data on seronegative hepatitis presenting to nontransplant centres. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical/laboratory features and natural history of seronegative hepatitis and compare these with viral/autoimmune hepatitis. METHODS: Cases of seronegative, viral and autoimmune hepatitis were identified from 2080 consecutive patients attending a rapid-access jaundice clinic over a 14-year period. RESULTS: Of 881 patients with hepatocellular jaundice, 27 (3%) had seronegative hepatitis, 44 (5%) autoimmune and 62 (7%) viral hepatitis (acute hepatitis A, B, C and E viruses). Fifteen out of 27 (56%) patients with seronegative hepatitis were male, median age 60 years (range 14-74). Peak bilirubin was 63 mumol/l (range 9-363), alanine aminotransferase 932 IU/l (range 503-3807). Duration of illness was 7 weeks (range 4-12). No patients developed liver failure or had further bouts of hepatitis. One patient developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia shortly after presentation.There was no difference in age/sex of patients with seronegative hepatitis and those with viral hepatitis. Compared with autoimmune hepatitis (age 65 years, range 15-91), patients with seronegative hepatitis were younger (P=0.002) and more likely to be male (P=0.004). Patients with autoimmune hepatitis were more likely (P<0.0001) to have an albumin less than 35 g/l, international normalized ratio greater than 1.2, raised IgG and positive antinuclear/smooth muscle antibody, compared with patients with seronegative hepatitis. CONCLUSION: Seronegative hepatitis presenting to a nontransplant centre is generally a self-limiting illness. The aetiology is more likely to be viral than autoimmune.","['Donaghy, Laura', 'Barry, Fergus J', 'Hunter, Jeremy G', 'Stableforth, William', 'Murray, Iain A', 'Palmer, Jo', 'Bendall, Richard P', 'Elsharkawy, Ahmed M', 'Dalton, Harry R']","['Donaghy L', 'Barry FJ', 'Hunter JG', 'Stableforth W', 'Murray IA', 'Palmer J', 'Bendall RP', 'Elsharkawy AM', 'Dalton HR']","['Cornwall Gastrointestinal Unit, Royal Cornwall Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,9000874,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Hepatitis/blood/complications/*immunology', 'Hepatitis, Autoimmune/blood/complications/immunology', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/blood/complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Jaundice/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,2013/05/09 06:00,2014/04/02 06:00,['2013/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MEG.0b013e3283610484 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2013 Oct;25(10):1159-64. doi: 10.1097/MEG.0b013e3283610484.,10,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conclusively, patients with a second ALL relapse are ideal candidates for phase I/II trials exploring new innovative drugs.","['Reismuller, Bettina', 'Peters, Christina', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Urban, Christian', 'Meister, Bernhard', 'Schmitt, Klaus', 'Dieckmann, Karin', 'Gadner, Helmut', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Mann, Georg']","['Reismuller B', 'Peters C', 'Dworzak MN', 'Potschger U', 'Urban C', 'Meister B', 'Schmitt K', 'Dieckmann K', 'Gadner H', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Mann G']","[""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, St Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Australia', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*mortality/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2013/05/09 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318290c3d6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jul;35(5):e200-4. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318290c3d6.,5,['Austrian ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) Study Group'],['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data collected were age, sex, diagnosis, chemotherapy, inpatient versus outpatient, microbiological data, risk factors, social risk score, and treatment performed. CRBSI rate decreased from 6.7 to 3.7/1000 catheter-days with preventive measures (P=0.05). A further decrease to 1.5/1000 catheter-days was reached after the intensification of the educational program (P=0.01).

The interindividual variability in MTX kinetics had a substantial genetic component between 68% and 75%. The SLCO1B1 rs4149056 variant was significantly associated with MTX kinetics. In a multiple regression model, MTX area under the concentration time curve (AUC)0-48h increased by 26% (P < .001) per SLCO1B1 rs4149056 C allele. MTX AUC0-48h was a significant predictor of overall toxic adverse events during MTX courses (R(2) = 0.043; P < .001), whereas the thymidylate synthase rs34743033 tandem repeat polymorphism was predictive of stomatitis (R(2) = 0.018; P = .009), a frequent side effect of high-dose MTX.

The three main endocrine tissues most frequently affected by tumors are parathyroid (95%), enteropancreatic neuroendocrine (50%) and anterior pituitary (40%). Tumors are caused by a heterozygous germline-inactivating mutation in the MEN1 gene (1st hit) followed by somatic inactivating mutation or loss of the normal copy of the gene (2nd hit), leading to complete loss of function of the encoded protein menin. Most of the disease features and tumors are recapitulated in mouse models with heterozygous germline loss of the Men1 gene. Also, tissue-specific tumors are observed in mouse models with homozygous somatic loss of the Men1 gene specifically in MEN1-associated endocrine tissues. Hence, mouse models could serve as possible surrogates for studying MEN1 and related states. To gain insights into MEN1 pathophysiology, menin-interacting partners and pathways have been identified to investigate its tumor suppressor and other functions. Also, the 3D crystal structure of menin has been deciphered which could be useful to reveal the relevance of MEN1 gene mutations and menin's interactions.

However, the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of action of SJKJT in human pancreatic cancer have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects of SJKJT on BxPC-3 human pancreatic carcinoma cells by MTT assay. The protein expression levels of myeloid cell leukemia 1 protein (Mcl-1), translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), caspase-8, caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 family in the BxPC-3 cells were measured by western blot analysis. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein expression of caspase-3 was also detected by immunocytochemistry (ICC). The results revealed that SJKJT inhibited the proliferation of BxPC-3 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The protein expression levels of TNF-alpha, caspase-8, caspase-3 and Bax increased in the BxPC-3 cells treated with SJKJT; however, the levels of Mcl-1, TCTP and Bcl-xL decreased. The results also demonstrated that SJKJT increased the percentage of BxPC-3 cells in the sub-G1 phase. In addition, ICC staining indicated that the protein expression of caspase-3 was upregulated in the BxPC-3 cells treated with SJKJT. These findings indicate that SJKJT inhibits the proliferation of BxPC-3 cells through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway, inducing apoptosis in vitro.

We report a retrospective single center analysis of aplasia-inducing chemotherapy using fludarabine, cytarabine, and amsacrine (FLAMSA) followed by reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in 62 consecutive primary refractory or relapsed AML patients. Two-year event-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 26 and 39%, respectively. Risk stratification according to cytogenetic and molecular genetic markers showed superior survival in patients in the intermediate-1 risk group (2-year OS 70%) compared to the intermediate-2 risk (2-year OS 34%, p = 0.03) and adverse risk (2-year OS 38%, p = 0.06) group. The use of HLA-matched versus HLA-mismatched donors had no significant influence on survival (p = 0.98). Two-year OS in the elderly subgroup defined by age >/=60 years was 31% compared to 46% in the group of younger patients <60 years (p = 0.19). Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at 2 years adjusted for relapse as competing risk was 20% for patients <60 years and 26% for older patients (p = 0.55). Chronic graft-versus-host disease was associated with a statistically significant superior survival (p < 0.01). FLAMSA-RIC followed by allogeneic HCT enables long-term disease-free survival in primary refractory or relapsed AML even in the elderly patient population.","['Schneidawind, Dominik', 'Federmann, Birgit', 'Faul, Christoph', 'Vogel, Wichard', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Bethge, Wolfgang Andreas']","['Schneidawind D', 'Federmann B', 'Faul C', 'Vogel W', 'Kanz L', 'Bethge WA']","['Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130508,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods']",,2013/05/09 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1774-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Oct;92(10):1389-95. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1774-5.

Our population-based study employed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to systemically survey non-pulmonary cancer risks after tuberculosis infections. METHODS: Data of patients who had newly diagnosed tuberculosis, were aged 20 years or older, and had no prior cancer or tuberculosis were sampled from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database between 2000 and 2010. SIRs compared cancer incidence in patients with tuberculosis infections to the general population. SIRs of specific cancers were further analyzed with respect to gender and time after tuberculosis infections. RESULTS: After a follow-up period of 28 866 person-years, 530 tuberculosis cases developed cancers compared with 256 cases in the general populations (2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.90-2.26). The SIR of non-pulmonary malignancies was also increased (1.71, 95% CI, 1.54-1.90). For males, SIRs were increased within 1 year after tuberculosis diagnosis for the following cancers: head and neck, esophageal, colorectal, liver, lung, melanomas, and Hodgkin's disease. SIRs were increased for liver, biliary, lung, and bladder cancers beyond the first year after tuberculosis diagnosis. For females, SIRs were increased for leukemia, esophageal, and lung cancers within the first year, and only for leukemia beyond 1 year post diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Having found increased risks of several cancers that differ with gender and time after tuberculosis diagnosis, physicians may consider these factors in patients following tuberculosis diagnosis.","['Kuo, S-C', 'Hu, Y-W', 'Liu, C-J', 'Lee, Y-T', 'Chen, Y-T', 'Chen, T-L', 'Chen, T-J', 'Fung, C-P']","['Kuo SC', 'Hu YW', 'Liu CJ', 'Lee YT', 'Chen YT', 'Chen TL', 'Chen TJ', 'Fung CP']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, School of Medicine, No. 155, Section 2, Linong Street, Taipei 112, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130507,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Tuberculosis/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3708573,2013/05/09 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013220 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.220 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 Jul 9;109(1):229-34. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.220.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between socioeconomic status, as assessed by paternal occupation at birth, and survival from childhood leukaemia in children, using data from the Northern Region Young Persons Malignant Disease Registry. METHODS: All 1007 cases of leukaemia in children aged 0-14 years, diagnosed between 1968 and 2010 and registered with the Registry were studied. Paternal occupational social class at the time of the child's birth was obtained and analysed in relation to survival using Cox-proportional regression. RESULTS: Compared with the most advantaged group (I/II), those in the middle group (IIIN/M) had a 68% increased risk of death, while those in the least advantaged group (IV/V) had 86% higher risk for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. While the survival advantage of children in class I/II was apparent from the time of diagnosis, survival for children in groups IIIN/M and IV/V were comparable until 3-4 years after diagnosis, when they began to minimally diverge. CONCLUSION: The existence of such socioeconomic disparities cannot be attributed to accessibility to health care in the United Kingdom. Further research into the likely factors underlying these disparities is required.","['Njoku, K', 'Basta, N', 'Mann, K D', 'McNally, R J Q', 'Pearce, M S']","['Njoku K', 'Basta N', 'Mann KD', 'McNally RJ', 'Pearce MS']","['Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130507,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/economics/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Social Class', 'Young Adult']",PMC3681006,2013/05/09 06:00,2013/09/18 06:00,['2013/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013222 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.222 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 Jun 11;108(11):2339-45. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.222.

The ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 decreases the stability of the proapoptotic factor p53. We show that it also coordinated apoptotic events in a p53-independent manner by ubiquitylating the apoptosome activator CAS and the ubiquitin E3 ligase HUWE1. HUWE1 ubiquitylates the antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1, and we found that HUWE1 also ubiquitylated PP5 (protein phosphatase 5), which indirectly inhibited apoptosome activation. Breast cancers that are positive for the tyrosine receptor kinase HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) tend to be highly aggressive. In HER2-positive breast cancer cells treated with the HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, MDM2 was degraded and HUWE1 was stabilized. In contrast, in breast cancer cells that acquired resistance to lapatinib, the abundance of MDM2 was not decreased and HUWE1 was degraded, which inhibited apoptosis, regardless of p53 status. MDM2 inhibition overcame lapatinib resistance in cells with either wild-type or mutant p53 and in xenograft models. These findings demonstrate broader, p53-independent roles for MDM2 and HUWE1 in apoptosis and specifically suggest the potential for therapy directed against MDM2 to overcome lapatinib resistance.","['Kurokawa, Manabu', 'Kim, Jiyeon', 'Geradts, Joseph', 'Matsuura, Kenkyo', 'Liu, Liu', 'Ran, Xu', 'Xia, Wenle', 'Ribar, Thomas J', 'Henao, Ricardo', 'Dewhirst, Mark W', 'Kim, Wun-Jae', 'Lucas, Joseph E', 'Wang, Shaomeng', 'Spector, Neil L', 'Kornbluth, Sally']","['Kurokawa M', 'Kim J', 'Geradts J', 'Matsuura K', 'Liu L', 'Ran X', 'Xia W', 'Ribar TJ', 'Henao R', 'Dewhirst MW', 'Kim WJ', 'Lucas JE', 'Wang S', 'Spector NL', 'Kornbluth S']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755, USA. manabu.kurokawa@dartmouth.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130507,United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lapatinib', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3770270,2013/05/09 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['6/274/ra32 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.2003741 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2013 May 7;6(274):ra32. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.2003741.,274,,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (protein phosphatase 5)']",,,"['K99 CA140948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA140948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS496768'],,,,,,,,,,

Ginkgo biloba extract was nominated for study by the National Cancer Institute because of its widespread use as an herbal supplement to promote mental function and the limited availability of toxicity and carcinogenicity data. Furthermore, one of the major ingredients in Ginkgo biloba extract, quercetin, is a known mutagen. The Ginkgo biloba extract used in the current studies was procured from a supplier known to provide material to United States companies and contained 31.2% flavonol glycosides, 15.4% terpene lactones (6.94% bilo-balide, 3.74% ginkgolide A, 1.62% ginkgolide B, 3.06% ginkgolide C), and 10.45 ppm ginkgolic acid. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1/N mice were administered Ginkgo biloba extract in corn oil by gavage for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, or 1,000 mg Ginkgo biloba extract/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. Additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats (clinical pathology study) were administered the same doses, 5 days per week for 23 days. All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of all dosed groups were similar to those of the vehicle control groups. Liver weights of all dosed groups of males and females were significantly greater than those of the vehicle control groups. The incidences of hepatocyte hypertrophy in all dosed groups of males and in 500 and 1,000 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those in the vehicle control groups; there was a dose-related increase in severity of this lesion in males. Hepatocyte fatty change occurred in all dosed males. The incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell hypertrophy were significantly increased in 500 and 1,000 mg/kg males and in 1,000 mg/kg females. The incidences of pigmentation in the olfactory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 500 and 1,000 mg/kg males and in females administered 125 mg/kg or greater. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg Ginkgo biloba extract/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. One female mouse in the 1,000 mg/kg group died of a dosing accident during week 11. Mean body weights of 2,000 mg/kg females were significantly less than those of the vehicle control group. Ruffled fur was observed in two 1,000 mg/kg males between weeks 7 and 8 and all 2,000 mg/kg males between weeks 5 and 9. Liver weights of 250 mg/kg or greater males and all dosed groups of females were significantly greater than those of the vehicle control groups. Kidney weights of 2,000 mg/kg males were significantly less than those of the vehicle control group. The Markov transition matrix analyses indicate female mice in the 2,000 mg/kg group had a significantly higher probability of extended estrus than did the vehicle control females. The incidences of hepatocytic hypertrophy were significantly increased in males and females in the 250 mg/kg or greater groups. Significantly increased incidences of focal hepatocytic necrosis occurred in 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg males. The incidences of hyaline droplet accumulation in the respiratory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 500 mg/kg males and 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg females. In the olfactory epithelium of the nose, the incidences of hyaline droplet accumulation were significantly increased in the 125 (female only), 500, and 1,000 mg/kg groups. Incidences of atrophy of the olfactory epithelium were significantly increased in the 1,000 mg/kg groups. The incidences of pigment accumulation in macrophages in the olfactory epithelium were significantly increased in males in the 500 mg/kg or greater groups and in 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were administered 0, 100, 300, or 1,000 mg Ginkgo biloba extract/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 104 or 105 (females) weeks. Additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats (special study) were administered the same doses, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. Survival of 1,000 mg/kg males was significantly less than that of the vehicle controls. At week 14, all dosed groups of males and 1,000 mg/kg females had increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone compared to those of the vehicle control groups. There were no significant decreases in the levels of triiodothyronine or total thyroxine. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg males and females were less (10% or more) than those of the vehicle controls after week 93, and those of 1,000 mg/kg males and females were less after week 89. Clinical findings included ruffled fur in seven, eight, and 10 males in the 100, 300, and 1,000 mg/kg groups, respectively, beginning at week 89; four vehicle control males also had ruffled fur. Liver weights were significantly increased in all dosed groups of special study rats at 14 weeks. In the liver at 2 years, incidences of hepatocellular adenoma were slightly increased in 100 and 300 mg/kg males. Significantly increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions at 2 years included hepatocyte hypertrophy and bile duct hyperplasia in all dosed groups of males and females, focal fatty change in all dosed groups of females, cystic degeneration in 100 and 1,000 mg/kg males, and oval cell hyperplasia and necrosis in 1,000 mg/kg males. In the thyroid gland, incidences of follicular cell adenoma were slightly increased in 300 and 1,000 mg/kg males and 300 mg/kg females. Single incidences of follicular cell carcinoma occurred in the 300 and 1,000 mg/kg female groups. There were significantly increased incidences of follicular cell hypertrophy in all dosed groups of males and females and follicle hyperplasia in all dosed groups of males. In the nose, adenoma of the respiratory epithelium occurred in two females receiving 300 mg/kg. Except for respiratory epithelium hyperplasia in 100 mg/kg females, the incidences of transitional epithelium and respiratory epithelium hyperplasia were significantly increased in all dosed groups of males and females. Except for olfactory epithelium respiratory metaplasia in 100 mg/kg females, the incidences of atrophy, respiratory metaplasia, nerve atrophy, and pigmentation were significantly increased in the olfactory epithelium of all dosed groups of males and females. Incidences of goblet cell hyperplasia in the respiratory epithelium were significantly increased in 300 and 1,000 mg/kg males and females, and incidences of chronic active inflammation were significantly increased in 1,000 mg/kg males and females. The incidence of submucosa fibrosis was significantly increased in 1,000 mg/kg males. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in 300 and 1,000 mg/kg males were significantly greater than that in the vehicle controls. Dose-related increased severity of kidney nephropathy was noted in all dosed groups of males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were administered 0, 200, 600, or 2,000 mg Ginkgo biloba extract/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 104 weeks. Survival of 600 and 2,000 mg/kg males was significantly less than that of the vehicle controls; survival of 600 mg/kg females was significantly greater than that of the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 600 and 2,000 mg/kg males were less (10% or more) than those of the vehicle controls after weeks 85 and 77, respectively; mean body weights of 2,000 mg/kg females were generally less than those of the vehicle controls between weeks 17 and 69 and after week 93. In the liver, there were significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in all dosed groups of females, hepatocellular carcinoma in all dosed groups of males and 2,000 mg/kg females, and hepatoblastoma in all dosed groups of males and 600 and 2,000 mg/kg females. The increased incidences of these neoplasms were primarily due to increased incidences of multiple adenoma, carcinoma, and hepatoblastoma. Except for the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma (combined) in 200 and 600 mg/kg females, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined), hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma (combined), and hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or hepatoblastoma (combined) were significantly increased in all dosed groups of males and females. Significantly increased incidences of nonneoplastic liver lesions included hypertrophy in all dosed groups of males and females, erythrophagocytosis in all dosed groups of males and in 600 and 2,000 mg/kg females, hematopoietic cell proliferation, inflammation, and necrosis in 600 and 2,000 mg/kg males, and cytoplasmic vacuolization, eosinophilic focus, and mixed cell focus in all dosed groups of females. In the thyroid gland, two incidences each of follicular cell adenoma occurred in the 600 and 2,000 mg/kg male groups. The incidence of follicle hyperplasia was significantly increased in 2,000 mg/kg males, and the incidences of follicular cell hypertrophy were significantly increased in 2,000 mg/kg males and 600 and 2,000 mg/kg females.

The induction of Treg activity by probiotics might be effective for promoting tolerance towards food allergens. Nasal cytology is useful in patients with rhinitis for diagnosing chronic non-allergic non-infectious diseases. Atopic eczema is associated both with an aberrant skin matrix and impaired systemic immune response. Therefore, isolated topical treatment may have suboptimal effect. Diagnostic work-up of exercise-induced anaphylaxis, including exercise challenge test, is necessary to reach a diagnosis.

Clinicians need to early identify adolescent menstrual abnormalities to minimize sequelae, and to promote health information. In Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2B investigations include acetylcholinesterase study of rectal mucosa followed by the molecular analysis of RET mutation. Low adherence to gluten-free diet and osteopenia are common problems in children with diabetes mellitus type 1 and celiac disease. In infantile colic, laboratory tests are usually unnecessary and the treatment is based on reassurance. Prevalence of obesity and stunting is elucidated by several studies. Evidences are growing that dietetic measures are needed to prevent obesity in children with acute leukemia. Treatment studies for infectious diseases show promise for probiotics along with standard triple therapy in children with Helicobacter pilori infection, while zinc has no effect on pneumonia. Educational programs about the proper management of the febrile child are warranted. A new hour-specific total serum bilirubin nomogram has been shown to be able to predict newborns without hyperbilirubinemia after 48 to 72 hours of life. Newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy present ECG and cardiac enzymes alterations leading to reduced neonatal survival. Rehabilitation programs including sensory integration therapy and motor performance, may improve activities of daily life in children with developmental coordination disorder.

Although OX40 has been reported to be a target gene of human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) viral transactivator Tax and is overexpressed in vivo in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells, an association between OX40 and HTLV-1-associated inflammatory disorders, such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), has not yet been established. Moreover, because abrogation of OX40 signals ameliorates chronic inflammation in animal models of autoimmune disease, novel monoclonal antibodies against OX40 may offer a potential treatment for HTLV-1-associated diseases such as ATL and HAM/TSP. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that OX40 was specifically expressed in CD4+ T cells naturally infected with HTLV-1 that have the potential to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines along with Tax expression. We also showed that OX40 was overexpressed in spinal cord infiltrating mononuclear cells in a clinically progressive HAM/TSP patient with a short duration of illness. The levels of the soluble form of OX40 (sOX40) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from chronic progressive HAM/TSP patients or from patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases (OINDs) were not different. In contrast, sOX40 levels in the CSF of rapidly progressing HAM/TSP patients were higher than those in the CSF from patients with OINDs, and these patients showed higher sOX40 levels in the CSF than in the plasma. When our newly produced monoclonal antibody against OX40 was added to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in culture, HTLV-1-infected T cells were specifically removed by a mechanism that depends on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified OX40 as a key molecule and biomarker for rapid progression of HAM/TSP. Furthermore, blocking OX40 may have potential in therapeutic intervention for HAM/TSP.","['Saito, Mineki', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Arishima, Shiho', 'Matsuzaki, Toshio', 'Ishihara, Satoshi', 'Tokashiki, Takashi', 'Ohya, Yusuke', 'Takashima, Hiroshi', 'Umehara, Fujio', 'Izumo, Shuji', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu']","['Saito M', 'Tanaka R', 'Arishima S', 'Matsuzaki T', 'Ishihara S', 'Tokashiki T', 'Ohya Y', 'Takashima H', 'Umehara F', 'Izumo S', 'Tanaka Y']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Okinawa, Japan. mineki@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130507,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/chemistry', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*pathology', 'Receptors, OX40/*analysis']",PMC3659064,2013/05/09 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-51 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 May 7;10:51. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-51.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average of the mean fluorescence intensities (avgMFI) of the class I beads in the screening assay was correlated with outcomes of RDPLT transfusions during a 2 week period.

Binding of the transcription factor mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) induces the formation of a low-populated conformer of KIX that resembles the conformation of the KIX domain in the presence of a second transcription factor molecule. NMR spin relaxation studies have previously shown that allosteric coupling proceeds through a network of hydrophobic core residues that bridge the two binding sites. Here we describe high-resolution NMR solution structures of the binary complex of KIX with MLL and the ternary complex of KIX formed with MLL and phosphorylated kinase inducible domain of CREB (pKID) as a second ligand. We show that binding of pKID to the binary complex of KIX with MLL is accompanied by a defined repacking of the allosteric network in the hydrophobic core of the protein. Rotamer populations derived from methyl group (13)C chemical shifts reveal a dynamic contribution to the repacking process that is not captured by the structural coordinates and exemplify the dynamic nature of allosteric communication in the KIX domain.,"['Bruschweiler, Sven', 'Konrat, Robert', 'Tollinger, Martin']","['Bruschweiler S', 'Konrat R', 'Tollinger M']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry, Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck (CMBI), University of Innsbruck , Innrain 80/82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*physiology', 'Coordination Complexes/chemistry', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Conformation', '*Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology']",PMC3719477,2013/05/09 06:00,2014/11/12 06:00,['2013/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb4002188 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2013 Jul 19;8(7):1600-10. doi: 10.1021/cb4002188.

Recent studies have shown that DHA effectively inhibits the growth of cancer cells. In the present study, we intended to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of growth of iron-loaded human myeloid leukemia K562 cells by DHA. Mitochondria are important regulators of both autophagy and apoptosis, and one of the triggers for mitochondrial dysfunction is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that the DHA-induced autophagy of leukemia K562 cells, whose intracellular organelles are primarily mitochondria, was ROS dependent. The autophagy of these cells was followed by LC3-II protein expression and caspase-3 activation. In addition, we demonstrated that inhibition of the proliferation of leukemia K562 cells by DHA is also dependent upon iron. This inhibition includes the down-regulation of TfR expression and the induction of K562 cell growth arrest in the G2/M phase.","['Wang, Zeng', 'Hu, Wei', 'Zhang, Jia-Li', 'Wu, Xiu-Hua', 'Zhou, Hui-Jun']","['Wang Z', 'Hu W', 'Zhang JL', 'Wu XH', 'Zhou HJ']","[""Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou Zhejiang 310058, People's Republic of China ; Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou 310022, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120523,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,,,PMC3642128,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.fob.2012.05.002 [doi]', 'FOB24 [pii]']",epublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2012 May 23;2:103-12. doi: 10.1016/j.fob.2012.05.002.

Essential for the functional characterization of PTPs is the identification of their physiological substrates, and an important step towards this goal is the demonstration of a physical interaction. The association of PTPs with their cellular substrates is, however, often transient and difficult to detect with unmodified proteins at endogenous levels. Density-enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1/PTPRJ) is a regulator of hematopoietic cell functions, and a candidate tumor suppressor. However, association of DEP-1 with any of its proposed substrates at endogenous levels has not yet been shown. We have previously obtained functional and biochemical evidence for a direct interaction of DEP-1 with the hematopoietic receptor-tyrosine kinase Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). In the current study we have used the method of in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA) to validate this interaction at endogenous levels, and to further characterize it. In situ PLA readily detected association of endogenous DEP-1 and FLT3 in the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, which was enhanced by FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation in a time-dependent manner. Association peaked between 10 and 20 min of stimulation and returned to basal levels at 30 min. This time course was similar to the time course of FLT3 autophosphorylation. FLT3 kinase inhibition and DEP-1 oxidation abrogated association. Consistent with a functional role of DEP-1-FLT3 interaction, stable knockdown of DEP-1 in THP-1 cells enhanced FL-induced ERK1/2 activation. These findings support that FLT3 is a bona fide substrate of DEP-1 and that interaction occurs mainly via an enzyme-substrate complex formation triggered by FLT3 ligand stimulation.","['Bohmer, Sylvia-Annette', 'Weibrecht, Irene', 'Soderberg, Ola', 'Bohmer, Frank-D']","['Bohmer SA', 'Weibrecht I', 'Soderberg O', 'Bohmer FD']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130501,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC3641115,2013/05/08 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0062871 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-28819 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 1;8(5):e62871. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062871.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 363 patients with primary CN-AML. miR-155 levels were measured in pretreatment marrow and blood by NanoString nCounter assays that quantified the expression of the encoding gene MIR155HG. All molecular prognosticators were assessed centrally. miR-155-associated gene and microRNA expression profiles were derived using microarrays. RESULTS: Considering all patients, high miR-155 expression was associated with a lower complete remission (CR) rate (P < .001) and shorter disease-free survival (P = .001) and overall survival (OS; P < .001) after adjusting for age. In multivariable analyses, high miR-155 expression remained an independent predictor for a lower CR rate (P = .007) and shorter OS (P < .001). High miR-155 expressers had approximately 50% reduction in the odds of achieving CR and 60% increase in the risk of death compared with low miR-155 expressers. Although high miR-155 expression was not associated with a distinct microRNA expression profile, it was associated with a gene expression profile enriched for genes involved in cellular mechanisms deregulated in AML (eg, apoptosis, nuclear factor-kappaB activation, and inflammation), thereby supporting a pivotal and unique role of this microRNA in myeloid leukemogenesis. CONCLUSION: miR-155 expression levels are associated with clinical outcome independently of other strong clinical and molecular predictors. The availability of emerging compounds with antagonistic activity to microRNAs in the clinic provides the opportunity for future therapeutic targeting of miR-155 in AML.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Maharry, Kati S', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Mendler, Jason H', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Maharry KS', 'Metzeler KH', 'Volinia S', 'Wu YZ', 'Mrozek K', 'Nicolet D', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Whitman SP', 'Mendler JH', 'Schwind S', 'Becker H', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Carroll AJ', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Garzon R', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Stone RM', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Biomedical Research Tower 460 W. 12th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. guido.marcucci@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130506,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",PMC3731981,2013/05/08 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.45.6228 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.45.6228 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jun 10;31(17):2086-93. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.45.6228.

This study examined genetic polymorphisms associated with variability in neurocognitive outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Neurocognitive outcomes were evaluated at the end of therapy in 243 survivors treated on an institutional protocol featuring risk-adapted chemotherapy without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Polymorphisms in genes related to pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents, drug metabolism, oxidative stress, and attention problems in noncancer populations were examined as predictors of outcome, using multiple general linear models and controlling for age at diagnosis, sex, race, and treatment intensity. RESULTS: Compared with national norms, the cohort demonstrated significantly higher rates of problems on direct assessment of sustained attention (P = .01) and on parent ratings of attention problems (P = .02). Children with the A2756G polymorphism in methionine synthase (MS) were more likely to demonstrate deficits in attentiveness (P = .03) and response speed (P = .02), whereas those with various polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase demonstrated increased performance variability (P = .01) and reduced attentiveness (P = .003). Polymorphisms in monoamine oxidase (T1460CA) were associated with increased attention variability (P = .03). Parent-reported attention problems were more common in children with the Cys112Arg polymorphism in apoliopoprotein E4 (P = .01). CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with our previous report of association between attention problems and MS in an independent cohort of long-term survivors of childhood ALL treated with chemotherapy only. The results also raise the possibility of an impact from genetic predispositions related to oxidative stress and CNS integrity.","['Krull, Kevin R', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Krull KR', 'Bhojwani D', 'Conklin HM', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Reddick WE', 'Sandlund JT', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS 735, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA. kevin.krull@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130506,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/*complications/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Survivors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3731978,2013/05/08 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.46.7944 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.46.7944 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jun 10;31(17):2182-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.46.7944.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an extremely rare adverse event that can occur during treatment with nilotinib, with only a few reported cases to date. Herein, we report two patients who developed TLS soon after the start of treatment with nilotinib. While in the first case, which co-presented with underlying mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency due to polycystic kidney disease, the TLS resolved on discontinuation of the drug, the second patient, who had an exceedingly high white blood cell count, presented with disseminated intravascular coagulation and severe liver injury triggered by TLS that developed after the start of nilotinib treatment, and died of multiple organ failure.

It has been suggested that expression analysis is capable of distinguishing compounds that cause DNA damage from those that interfere with mitotic spindle function. Formaldehyde (FA) is known to be a DNA-reactive substance which mainly induces chromosomal damage in cultured mammalian cells. However, there has been concern that FA might also induce leukemia-specific aneuploidies, although recent cytogenetic studies excluded a relevant aneugenic potential of FA. We now investigated whether gene expression profiling can be used as a molecular tool to further characterize FA's genotoxic mode of action and to differentiate between clastogenic and aneugenic activity. TK6 cells were exposed to FA for 4 and 24 h, and changes in gene expression were analyzed using a whole-genome human microarray. Results were compared to the expression profiles of two DNA-damaging clastogens (methyl methanesulfonate and ethyl methanesulfonate) and two aneugens (colcemid and vincristine). The genotoxic activity of FA, MMS and EMS under these conditions was confirmed by comet assay experiments. The gene expression profiles indicated that clastogens and aneugens induce discriminable gene expression patterns. Exposure of TK6 cells to FA led to a discrete gene expression pattern, and all toxicogenomics analyses revealed a closer relationship of FA with clastogens than with aneugens.","['Kuehner, Stefanie', 'Holzmann, Karlheinz', 'Speit, Gunter']","['Kuehner S', 'Holzmann K', 'Speit G']","['Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitat Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Microarray-Core Facility, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Helmholtzstrasse 8/1, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitat Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany. guenter.speit@uni-ulm.de.', 'Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitat Ulm, 89069, Ulm, Germany. guenter.speit@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130507,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents', 'Comet Assay', 'Demecolcine/toxicity', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate/toxicity', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genes, p53/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate/toxicity', 'Microarray Analysis', '*Mutagens', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vincristine/toxicity']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00204-013-1060-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-013-1060-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2013 Nov;87(11):1999-2012. doi: 10.1007/s00204-013-1060-2.

Its transcript is expressed in NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells and human peripheral blood neutrophils, and expression is increased in NB4 cells treated with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Knockdown of HOXA-AS2 expression by transduced shRNA decreases the number of viable cells and increases the proportion of apoptotic cells, measured by annexin V binding and by activity and cleavage of caspases-3, -8, and -9. The increase in death of HOXA-AS2 knockdown cells was accompanied by an elevated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) levels, but ATRA-induced NB4 cells treated with TRAIL did show an increase in HOXA-AS2 expression. These results demonstrate that ATRA induction of HOXA-AS2 suppresses ATRA-induced apoptosis, possibly through a TRAIL-mediated pathway. HOXA-AS2-mediated negative regulation thus contributes to the fine-tuning of apoptosis during ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation in NB4 cells.","['Zhao, Hang', 'Zhang, Xueqing', 'Frazao, Josias Brito', 'Condino-Neto, Antonio', 'Newburger, Peter E']","['Zhao H', 'Zhang X', 'Frazao JB', 'Condino-Neto A', 'Newburger PE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",PMC3999165,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24586 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2013 Oct;114(10):2375-83. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24586.,10,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,"['R01 DK054369/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK054369/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS570190'],"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['APOPTOSIS', 'Hox GENE CLUSTER', 'LONG INTERGENIC NON-CODING RNA (lincRNA)', 'MYELOID', 'NON-CODING RNA']",,,,,,,

The rate of E. coli bacteremia per 1,000 admissions at the AHC was higher (85.0) than in the other clinics of the hospital (2.9), p < 0.001. A higher mortality was observed in patients with a history of E. coli versus non-E. coli bacteremia [30/95 (31 %) vs. 53/430 (12 %), p < 0.001]; 72.8 % of patients with leukemia had an unknown source of bacteremia.

These gastrointestinal E. coli isolates were replaced within 3-8 weeks with a new E. coli H genotype. A recurrent episode of bacteremia was usually caused by an infection with a transient E. coli H genotype identical to that found in the subject's bowel. Consistent with the definition of bowel/blood translocation, the bowel appeared to be a portal for E. coli in these subjects and, hence, a clear source for their recurring bacteremia.","['Samet, A', 'Sledzinska, A', 'Krawczyk, B', 'Hellmann, A', 'Nowicki, S', 'Kur, J', 'Nowicki, B']","['Samet A', 'Sledzinska A', 'Krawczyk B', 'Hellmann A', 'Nowicki S', 'Kur J', 'Nowicki B']","['Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Gdansk University of Medicine, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130507,Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/*microbiology', '*Bacterial Translocation', 'Blood/microbiology', 'Colon/microbiology', 'Escherichia coli/*classification/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Molecular Typing', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment']",PMC3824565,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/05/28 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10096-013-1886-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2013 Nov;32(11):1393-400. doi: 10.1007/s10096-013-1886-9.

Diagnostic immunophenotypes were recapitulated in each case, and subtype specific markers were detected. To identify new leukemia-associated markers, we filtered the surfaceome data set against gene expression information from sorted, normal hematopoietic cells. Nine candidate markers (CD18, CD63, CD31, CD97, CD102, CD157, CD217, CD305, and CD317) were validated by flow cytometry in patient samples at diagnosis and during chemotherapy. CD97, CD157, CD63, and CD305 accounted for the most informative differences between normal and malignant cells.

Genome-wide analyses have revealed the mutation, deletion, and dysregulated expression of chromatin-modifying enzymes in a number of cancers, including hematologic malignancies. Genome-wide studies of DNA methylation and histone modifications are beginning to reveal the landscape of cancer-specific chromatin patterns. In parallel, recent genetic loss-of-function studies in murine models are demonstrating functional involvement of chromatin-modifying enzymes in malignant cell proliferation and self-renewal. Paradoxically, the same chromatin modifiers can, depending on cancer type, be either hyperactive or inactivated. Increasingly, cross talk between epigenetic pathways is being identified. Leukemias carrying MLL rearrangements are quintessential cancers driven by dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms in which fusion proteins containing N-terminal sequences of MLL require few or perhaps no additional mutations to cause human leukemia.

Fundamental and clinical studies on cancer were conducted from the viewpoint of Western medicine so far. However, a sustained complete remission has not been achieved yet. In order to alleviate the side effects of anticancer drugs, some traditional herbal medicines (Kampo medicines) have been prescribed to cancer patients. We have been studying on antitumor substances in medicinal herbs and found an antitumor medicinal herb named Rhus verniciflua (lacquer, Urushi in Japanese). To investigate the antitumor effect in vitro, a plant extract mixture was prepared from six medicinal herbs containing lacquer. The plant extract mixture containing lacquer (Rv-PEM) inhibited the proliferation of several mouse and human tumor cell lines. Rv-PEM had more potent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human leukemia cell lines (MOLT-3, KG-1) than on other tumor cell lines. The IC50 values of Rv-PEM on MOLT-3 and KG-1 cells were 0.208 and 0.293 mg/mL, respectively. After treating Rv-PEM to the tumor cells, DNA fragmentation and Caspase-3 and -9 activity increased in the treated cells. The mechanisms of the inhibitory proliferation activity of Rv-PEM would involve apoptosis of human leukemia cells (MOLT-3, KG-1, K-562) by the mitochondrial pathway.","['Hiruma, Wataru', 'Suruga, Kohei', 'Kadokura, Kazunari', 'Tomita, Tsuyoshi', 'Sekino, Yoshihiro', 'Komatsu, Yasuhiro', 'Kimura, Masahiko', 'Ono, Nobufumi']","['Hiruma W', 'Suruga K', 'Kadokura K', 'Tomita T', 'Sekino Y', 'Komatsu Y', 'Kimura M', 'Ono N']","['Medicinal Informatics and Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', '*Rhus', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/04/10 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/yakushi/12-00278-1 [pii]', '10.1248/yakushi.12-00278-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2013;133(5):487-91. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.12-00278-1.,5,,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histone acetylation and an open chromatin configuration are key features of transcribed regions and are mainly present around active promoters. Our recent identification of the SET-domain containing protein UpSET established a new functional link between the modulation of open chromatin features and active recruitment of well-known co-repressors in metazoans. Structurally, the SET domain of UpSET resembles H3K4 and H3K36 methyltransferases; however, it is does not confer histone methyltransferase activity. Rather than methylating histones to regulate gene expression like other SET domain-containing proteins, UpSET fine-tunes transcription by modulating the chromatin structure around active promoters resulting in suppression of expression of off-target genes or nearby repetitive elements. Chromatin modulation by UpSET occurs in part through its interaction with histone deacetylases. Here, we discuss the different scenarios in which UpSET could play key roles in modulating gene expression.","['Rincon-Arano, Hector', 'Parkhurst, Susan M', 'Groudine, Mark']","['Rincon-Arano H', 'Parkhurst SM', 'Groudine M']","['Basic Sciences Division; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Seattle, WA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Comment']",20130506,United States,Fly (Austin),Fly,101470897,IM,"['Animals', 'Drosophila Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",PMC4049847,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/05/31 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['24732 [pii]', '10.4161/fly.24732 [doi]']",ppublish,Fly (Austin). 2013 Jul-Sep;7(3):153-60. doi: 10.4161/fly.24732.

Numerous studies have focused on analyses of the expression profiles of cellular miRNAs, but the expression patterns of Dicer, which is responsible for the generation of miRNAs, have only rarely been explored in Gallus gallus. We developed a duplex realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) assay for the relative quantification of the mRNAs of Dicer and beta-actin in G. gallus. To apply this method, the expression of Dicer in avian cells after infection with avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) was detected using our established duplex real-time RT-PCR. The duplex realtime RT-PCR assay is sufficiently sensitive, specific, accurate, reproducible, and cost-effective for the detection of Dicer in G. gallus. Furthermore, this study, for the first time, demonstrated that ALV-J can induce differential expression of Dicer mRNA in the ALV-J-infected cells.","['Ji, Xiaolin', 'Wang, Qi', 'Gao, Yulong', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Qin, Liting', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Wang, Xiaomei']","['Ji X', 'Wang Q', 'Gao Y', 'Wang Y', 'Qin L', 'Qi X', 'Gao H', 'Wang X']","['Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, China.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),J Microbiol Biotechnol,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,9431852,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/physiology', 'Chickens/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Ribonuclease III/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JMB023-05-05 [pii]', '10.4014/jmb.1211.11083 [doi]']",ppublish,J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2013 May;23(5):630-6. doi: 10.4014/jmb.1211.11083.,5,,['EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified the tumor suppressor MEN1 as a gene required for oncogene-induced senescence in melanocytes, raising the possibility that MEN1 is a melanoma tumor suppressor. Here we show that MEN1 expression is lost in a high percentage of human melanomas and melanoma cell lines. We find that melanocytes depleted of MEN1 are deficient in homologous recombination (HR)-directed DNA repair, which is accompanied by increased nonhomologous end-joining activity. Following DNA damage, MEN1 levels increase as a result of phosphorylation by the DNA damage kinase ATM/ATR. Most importantly, we show that MEN1 functions by directly stimulating the transcription of several genes, including BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1, that encode proteins involved in HR. MEN1 and its coactivator, the mixed-lineage leukemia histone methyltransferase, are recruited to the BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1 promoters by estrogen receptor 1, resulting in increased histone H3-lysine 4 trimethylation and transcription. Collectively, our results indicate that MEN1 is a melanoma tumor suppressor that functions by stimulating the transcription of genes involved in HR-directed DNA repair.","['Fang, Minggang', 'Xia, Fen', 'Mahalingam, Meera', 'Virbasius, Ching-Man', 'Wajapeyee, Narendra', 'Green, Michael R']","['Fang M', 'Xia F', 'Mahalingam M', 'Virbasius CM', 'Wajapeyee N', 'Green MR']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Programs in Gene Function and Expression and Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130506,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'BRCA1 Protein/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Rad51 Recombinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinational DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3700119,2013/05/08 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00167-13 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00167-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Jul;33(13):2635-47. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00167-13.

Recent studies have revealed that the fine-tuning activity of mTOR complexes contributes to both maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and suppression of leukemogenesis. Dysregulation of mTORC1 activity results in impaired HSC homeostasis. Abnormalities of mTOR signaling are observed in many patients with leukemia and genetic studies clearly show that the leukemogenesis associated with Pten deficiency involves both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Although the several mTOR inhibitors have been developed for cancer therapy, effectiveness of the inhibitors for eradication of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is unknown. Advances in understanding of how mTOR signaling is involved in mechanisms of normal HSC and LSC homeostasis may lead to novel therapeutic approaches that can successfully eradicate leukemia.","['Hirao, Atsushi', 'Hoshii, Takayuki']","['Hirao A', 'Hoshii T']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Cancer and Stem Cell Research Program, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan. ahirao@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130609,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7657242,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/02/15 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12189 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Aug;104(8):977-82. doi: 10.1111/cas.12189.

To know the role of TAMs in the growth and progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), we calculated intratumoral CD204, CD163 or CD68 expressing macrophage count (MvarphiC) and CD34-positive microvessel density (MVD) by immunohistochemistry in 70 cases of surgically resected ESCCs and compared them with the clinicopathological factors and prognosis of patients. MvarphiC had positive linear association with MVD. High CD204(+) MvarphiC were significantly correlated with more malignant phenotypes including depth of tumor invasion, lymph and blood vessel invasion, lymph node metastasis as well as clinical stages. On the other hand, CD163(+) MvarphiC did not associate with these clinicopathological factors with the exception of depth of tumor invasion and blood vessel invasion. Patients with high CD204(+) MvarphiC ESCCs showed poor disease-free survival (P = 0.021).

We hypothesized that the changes may be secondary to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which could be alleviated by either argirein or valsartan. METHODS: Hepatosteatosis in diabetic liver was induced in rats fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks combined with a single low dose of streptozotocin (STZ 35 mg/kg, ip). Interventions (mg/kg/d, po)with either argirein (50, 100 and 200) or valsartan (12) were conducted in the last 4 weeks. KEY FINDINGS: In diabetic liver fat was significantly accumulated in association with elevated hepatic glucose, serum insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance value. Downregulated glucose transporter 4, insulin receptor substrate-1 and leptin receptor (P < 0.01) were found relative to normal, where DNA ladder, downregulated B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2, upregulated B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 Associated X protein and upregulated ER stress chaperones such as Bip/GRP78 (also known as Binding Protein, BiP), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), p-PERK/PERK and C/EBP homologous protein were significant.

CONCLUSIONS: Hepatosteatosis induced by HFD/low STZ manifests insulin resistance and apoptosis, linked to an entity of low-grade inflammation due to activated ER stress sensors.

METHODS: The effects of CO1 and the reference compound doxorubicin (DOX) on examined cells were analysed by studying their cytotoxicity, drug intracellular accumulation, cell cycle distribution, caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity, Fas expression and lysosomal integrity. KEY FINDINGS: CO1 was much less effective at influencing the cell cycle of examined cells than DOX a well-known antitumour drug targeting cellular DNA and causing G2/M checkpoint arrest. CO1 caused much less pronounced appearance of the sub-G1 population and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, characteristic of apoptosis, compared with DOX. Significantly lower caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity was also observed in the response of these cells to CO1 compared with DOX treatment. CO1 did not change the expression of the Fas death receptor, characteristic of apoptotic pathways, on the surface of studied cells. Interestingly, the results showed that CO1 caused lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) of the cells, whereas DOX did not perturb the lysosomal integrity of the studied cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that CO1 could induce LMP-mediated cell death as a main lethal effect in a caspase-independent fashion.","['Nowak, Robert', 'Tarasiuk, Jolanta']","['Nowak R', 'Tarasiuk J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130228,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jphp.12042 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2013 Jun;65(6):855-67. doi: 10.1111/jphp.12042.

This first-in-human, standard 3 + 3 dose escalating trial of oral, once daily tefinostat was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of tefinostat in relapsed/refractory haematological diseases. Eighteen patients were enrolled at doses of 20-640 mg. Plasma concentrations of tefinostat exceeded those demonstrated to give in vitro anti-proliferative activity. Flow cytometric pharmacodynamic assays demonstrated monocyte-targeted increases in protein acetylation, without corresponding changes in lymphocytes. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were not observed and dose escalation was halted at 640 mg without identification of the maximum tolerated dose. Drug-related toxicities were largely Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1/2 and included nausea, anorexia, fatigue, constipation, rash and increased blood creatinine. A patient with chronic monomyelocytic leukaemia achieved a bone marrow response, with no change in peripheral monocytes. An acute myeloid leukaemia type M2 patient showed a >50% decrease in bone marrow blasts and clearance of peripheral blasts. In conclusion, tefinostat produces monocyte-targeted HDACi activity and is well tolerated, without the DLTs, e.g. fatigue, diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, commonly seen with non-targeted HDACi.

This article reports the first case of hairy cell leukemia in a patient with situs inversus totalis in western literature. There have been studies into the pathogenesis of situs inversus totalis that suggest it is caused by the failure of embryonic cells to properly rotate during embryogenesis. On the molecular level, the nodal cilia, which are responsible for embryonic rotation, are built by transport through the KIF3 complex - a kinesin superfamily of molecular motors. The KIF3 complex is also responsible for N-cadherin movement in cells. Furthermore, it is well known that these cell adhesion molecules play an important role in carcinogenesis and its progression.

These responses have spurred the interest in developing agents that increase cAMP to treat such malignancies and to identify mechanisms of the responses. AREAS COVERED: The murine T-lymphoma cell line S49, has provided an important, pioneering model to define mechanisms of cAMP-mediated lymphoid cell death. Studies with S49 cells demonstrated that cAMP, acting via protein kinase A (PKA), is pro-apoptotic through a mitochondria-dependent pathway and identified cAMP/PKA-regulated targets involved in apoptosis. Akin to such findings, cAMP promotes apoptosis via PKA of cells from patients with CLL. Analysis of mediators of cAMP accumulation and cAMP-promoted apoptosis in CLL cells has revealed approaches to increase cAMP and engage its pro-apoptotic action. EXPERT OPINION: This 'pathway approach' targeted to cAMP has identified GPCR agonists/antagonists, AC activators (e.g., AC7), PDE inhibitors (e.g., PDE7B) and/or activators or inhibitors of downstream mediators (PKA and Epac, respectively), which might be utilized therapeutically in CLL. Therapy directed at such targets may prove to be clinically useful and may also provide a proof-of-principle of the utility of targeting cAMP signaling in other types of cancer.","['Murray, Fiona', 'Insel, Paul A']","['Murray F', 'Insel PA']","['University of California San Diego, Department of Pharmacology, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130507,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/02/12 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2013.798304 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2013 Aug;17(8):937-49. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2013.798304.

These findings should be interpreted cautiously, as the estimated false positive report probabilities (FPRPs) for each association were not noteworthy (i.e. FPRP > 0.2). While studies of candidate polymorphisms may be an attractive means of identifying risk factors for CLL, the limited power of published studies to demonstrate statistically significant associations makes it essential that future analyses be based on sample sizes well-powered to identify variants having modest effects on CLL risk.","['Sava, Georgina P', 'Speedy, Helen E', 'Houlston, Richard S']","['Sava GP', 'Speedy HE', 'Houlston RS']","['Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research , Sutton, Surrey , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20130624,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinogens/metabolism', 'DNA Repair/genetics', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.800197 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Jan;55(1):160-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.800197.

Whilst the alloresponse is of extraordinary potency and frequency, it has often been assumed to be less peptide-specific than conventional T-cell reactivity. Recently, several human studies have shown that both alloreactive CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells exhibit exquisite allo-HLA and endogenous peptide specificity that has also underpinned tissue-specific allorecognition. In this review, we summarize former and recent scientific evidence in support of endogenous peptide (self-peptide)-dependence of T-cell alloreactivity. The clinical implications of these findings will be discussed in the context of both solid organ transplantation and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Insights into the understanding of the molecular basis of T-cell allorecognition will probably translate into improved allograft survival outcomes, lower frequencies of graft vs host disease and could potentially be exploited for selective graft vs leukaemia effect to improve clinical outcomes following HSCT.","[""D'Orsogna, L J"", 'Nguyen, T H O', 'Claas, F H J', 'Witt, C', 'Mifsud, N A']","[""D'Orsogna LJ"", 'Nguyen TH', 'Claas FH', 'Witt C', 'Mifsud NA']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.

The key therapy of refractory leukemia is to kill, thoroughly, the minimal residual disease and leukemia stem cells in the highly vascularized red marrow areas. In this study, two new conjugates, alendronate-polyethylene glycol (100) monostearate and folate-polyethylene glycol (100) monostearate, were synthesized to develop a multistep targeting nanostructured lipid carriers by enhancing drug transport to the high bone turnover areas adjacent to the red marrow and targeting the minimal residual disease and leukemia stem cells. This dual targeting system demonstrated a great binding affinity to hydroxyapatite, a model component of bone minerals, and higher cell uptake (in the form of carriers but not drug) and cytotoxicity in the K562 cell line, a leukemia cell line with overexpressed folate receptors, were observed in vitro compared to unmodified carriers, especially when the cells were pretreated and the receptors were up-regulated by all-trans retinoic acid. The comodel test of K562 cells and HA showed that this dual targeting system could desorb from bone surface and be taken up by leukemia cells. For the in vivo study, this dual targeting system exhibited a significant increase in plasma half-life and could specifically accumulate in the bone tissue of rats or mice after intravenous injection. Ex vivo imaging of mice femurs and confocal laser scanning microscope imaging of mice femur slices further confirmed that this dual targeting system could favorably deposit to the osteoblast-enriched areas of high bone turnover in regions of trabecular bone surrounded by red marrow. In vivo antitumor activity in K562/BALB/c-nu leukemia mice showed that the treatment of this dual targeting system significantly reduced the white blood cell (WBC) number in peripheral blood and bone marrow to the normal level. In conclusion, this dual targeting system could precisely target to the regions where the minimal residual disease and leukemia stem cells are located and then be specifically uptaken in large amounts, which is a valuable target for refractory leukemia therapy.","['Shi, Yongping', 'Su, Zhigui', 'Li, Sai', 'Chen, Yinan', 'Chen, Xi', 'Xiao, Yanyu', 'Sun, Minjie', 'Ping, Qineng', 'Zong, Li']","['Shi Y', 'Su Z', 'Li S', 'Chen Y', 'Chen X', 'Xiao Y', 'Sun M', 'Ping Q', 'Zong L']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Key Lab of State Natural Medicine, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Durapatite/chemistry', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Rats']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/01/16 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp4001266 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2013 Jun 3;10(6):2479-89. doi: 10.1021/mp4001266.

In contrast, a minority of them still have a high risk of leukemia recurrence. This study investigated the adverse features of CBF AML that could justify investigational therapeutic approaches. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients (median age 42 yr, range 16-69) with CBF AML (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 n = 74; CBFB-MYH11 n = 76) were prospectively enrolled into two consecutive CETLAM protocols at 19 Spanish institutions. Main clinic and biologic parameters were analyzed in the whole series. In non-selected cases with available DNA samples, the impact of molecular characterization and minimal residual disease (MRD) was also studied. RESULTS: Overall, complete remission (CR) rate was 89% (94% in </=50 yr old and 72% in >50 yr, P = 0.002). At 5 yr, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 26 +/- 1%, disease-free survival (DFS) 62 +/- 6%, and overall survival (OS) 66 +/- 4%. In multivariate analyses, leukocyte count above 20 x 10(9) /L, BAALC over-expression, and high copy numbers of RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFB-MYH11 after induction chemotherapy (CT) led to increased relapse rate. Regarding OS, age >50 yr, leukocyte count above 20 x 10(9) /L, and increased MN1 expression were adverse features. CONCLUSION: Age, leukocyte counts, BAALC, and MN1 gene expressions as well as high copy numbers of RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFB-MYH11 after induction chemotherapy are useful tools to predict the outcome and should be considered for risk-adapted therapy.","['Hoyos, Montserrat', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Duarte, Rafael', 'Ribera, Josep M', 'Llorente, Andreu', 'Escoda, Lourdes', 'Bueno, Javier', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Gallardo, David', 'de Llano, Maria Paz Queipo', 'Marti, Josep M', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Mangues, Ramon', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Hoyos M', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Esteve J', 'Duarte R', 'Ribera JM', 'Llorente A', 'Escoda L', 'Bueno J', 'Tormo M', 'Gallardo D', 'de Llano MP', 'Marti JM', 'Aventin A', 'Mangues R', 'Brunet S', 'Sierra J']","[""Spanish CETLAM Group Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Spanish Cancer Network (RTICC), Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain; University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130725,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Core Binding Factors/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12130 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Sep;91(3):209-18. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12130.

We used the qRT-PCR to analyze the expression level of mRNA for 11 genes in irradiated and FNP pre-treated irradiated K562 cells, and compared the gene expression level with the overall cell survival. Our results of the improved cell survival in FNP-treated irradiated cells and significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and cytoprotective genes such as GSTA4, MnSOD, NOS, CAT and HO-1 genes, may indicate that FNP exerts cytoprotective function in K562 leukemic cells, rendering K562 cells more tolerant to radiotherapy.","['Stankov, Karmen', 'Borisev, Ivana', 'Kojic, Vesna', 'Rutonjski, Lazar', 'Bogdanovic, Gordana', 'Djordjevic, Aleksandar']","['Stankov K', 'Borisev I', 'Kojic V', 'Rutonjski L', 'Bogdanovic G', 'Djordjevic A']","['Medical Faculty Novi Sad, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, University of Novi Sad, Hajduk Veljkova 1, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Nanosci Nanotechnol,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,101088195,IM,"['Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Fullerenes/*administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/administration & dosage', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,2013/05/08 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/05/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jnn.2013.6847 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nanosci Nanotechnol. 2013 Jan;13(1):105-13. doi: 10.1166/jnn.2013.6847.,1,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Fullerenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'NP9U26B839 (fullerene C60)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adoptive transfer experiments and the expression of neuropilin-1 indicate that these cells are predominantly natural Tregs rather than virus-specific conventional CD4(+) T cells that converted into induced Tregs. Analysis of Treg TCR Vbeta chain usage revealed a broadly distributed polyclonal response with a high proportionate expansion of the Vbeta5(+) Treg subset, which is known to be responsive to endogenous retrovirus-encoded superantigens. In contrast to the major population of Tregs, the Vbeta5(+) subset expressed markers of terminally differentiated effector cells, and their expansion was associated with the level of the antiviral CD8(+) T cell response rather than the level of Friend virus infection. Surprisingly, the expansion and accumulation of the Vbeta5(+) Tregs was IL-2 independent but dependent on TNF-alpha.

AML1-ETO (AE) is an oncogene that plays an important role in inducing self-renewal of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), leading to the development of leukemia stem cells. Previously, using a zebrafish model of AE and a whole-organism chemical suppressor screen, we have discovered that AE induces specific hematopoietic phenotypes in embryonic zebrafish through a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and beta-catenin-dependent pathway. Here, we show that AE also induces expression of the Cox-2 gene and activates beta-catenin in mouse bone marrow cells. Inhibition of COX suppresses beta-catenin activation and serial replating of AE(+) mouse HSPCs. Genetic knockdown of beta-catenin also abrogates the clonogenic growth of AE(+) mouse HSPCs and human leukemia cells. In addition, treatment with nimesulide, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, dramatically suppresses xenograft tumor formation and inhibits in vivo progression of human leukemia cells. In summary, our data indicate an important role of a COX/beta-catenin-dependent signaling pathway in tumor initiation, growth, and self-renewal, and in providing the rationale for testing potential benefits from common COX inhibitors as a part of AML treatments.","['Zhang, Yiyun', 'Wang, Jianfeng', 'Wheat, Justin', 'Chen, Xi', 'Jin, Shan', 'Sadrzadeh, Hossein', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Peterson, Randall T', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Sweetser, David A', 'Yeh, Jing-Ruey Joanna']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang J', 'Wheat J', 'Chen X', 'Jin S', 'Sadrzadeh H', 'Fathi AT', 'Peterson RT', 'Kung AL', 'Sweetser DA', 'Yeh JR']","['Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130503,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Zebrafish', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3682341,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57286-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-08-447763 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 13;121(24):4906-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-08-447763.

METHODS: Prospective study from February 2008 to December 2009 of emergency admissions to a paediatric intensive care unit aged over 6 weeks. Children with a penetrating eye injury or suspected or proven abusive head injury were excluded. The children underwent either dilated funduscopy performed by a paediatric ophthalmologist or RetCam imaging. RESULTS: Retinal haemorrhages were identified in 24/159 (15%) patients. 50% of the haemorrhages were bilateral. The severity was mild (<5 retinal haemorrhages) or moderate (5-20 retinal haemorrhages) in 75%. The location was in zone 1 in 45.8%, zones 1 and 2 in 33.3%, zone 2 alone in 8.3% and not described in 8.3%. Schisis cavities and perimacular folds were identified in two patients with one having a pseudohypopyon appearance; a further one patient had bilateral haemorrhagic retinal detachments. Three patients had exudates or scarring consistent with cytomegalovirus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal haemorrhages are seen in a proportion of critically ill children, however most retinal bleeding is not extensive as indicated by location within the retina or layer of bleeding. Higher numbers and extent of retinal haemorrhages were only observed in the presence of severe coagulopathy, leukaemia, one victim of a road traffic accident, and one child who sustained a fatal witnessed fall down the stairs; all circumstances that would be readily distinguished by history and laboratory testing from abusive head injury.","['Adams, G G W', 'Agrawal, Shruti', 'Sekhri, Rajnish', 'Peters, Mark J', 'Pierce, Christine M']","['Adams GG', 'Agrawal S', 'Sekhri R', 'Peters MJ', 'Pierce CM']","['Department of Strabismus and Paediatrics, Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK. gill.adams@blueyonder.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130504,England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Critical Illness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retinal Hemorrhage/etiology/*pathology']",,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['bjophthalmol-2012-302429 [pii]', '10.1136/bjophthalmol-2012-302429 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 2013 Sep;97(9):1138-42. doi: 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2012-302429.

Storing irradiated feeder cells by cryopreserving them in multiple vials would be more convenient than irradiating cells each time they are needed. We compared NK cell expansion using cryopreserved-irradiated feeder cells (cryopreserved group) and freshly-irradiated feeder cells (fresh group). To expand NK cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and co-cultured with-100 Gy-irradiated K562 leukemia cells that had been modified to express 4-1BB ligand and membrane-bound (mb) interleukin (IL)-15 (K562-mb15-41BBL cells) for three weeks in the presence of IL-2 and IL-15. Fresh and cryopreserved K562-mb15-41BBL feeder cells expressed similar levels of 4-1BB ligand, whereas membrane-bound IL-15 expression was lower in the cryopreserved cells than in the fresh cells.

Twenty-eight patients with relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia were treated on four dosing cohorts of weekly rituximab at 375 mg/m(2) and alemtuzumab doses that started at 30 mg three times per week and escalated to weekly dosing over four weeks, culminating with 90 mg weekly. One dose limiting toxicity of a rituximab infusion reaction was seen in cohort 2, but the regimen was otherwise well tolerated without evidence of differential toxicity by cohort. The overall response rate by National Cancer Institute-Working Group criteria was 61%, and the rate of complete bone marrow response was 43%, most of whom were negative for minimal residual disease. The addition of CT scan evaluation per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 criteria reduced the overall response rate to 14%. Median overall survival was 35 months, with 12 patients able to proceed to stem cell transplantation. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that chronic lymphocytic leukemia involving more than 80% of the bone marrow at study start was associated with lower trough concentrations of alemtuzumab and rituximab, and that higher trough serum concentrations of alemtuzumab were associated with complete bone marrow clearance. We conclude that escalated subcutaneous doses of alemtuzumab given weekly are well tolerated and result in excellent bone marrow clearance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, helping patients to proceed to stem cell transplantation.

Few studies have been designed to assess the influence of a wide range of cumulative steroid dose on this side effect. Prevalence, risk factors of symptomatic osteonecrosis and its impact on adults' Quality of Life were assessed in 943 patients enrolled in the French ""Leucemies de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent"" (LEA) cohort of childhood leukemia survivors. During each medical visit, data on previous osteonecrosis diagnosis were retrospectively collected. Patients without a history but with suggestive symptoms were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging. The total steroid dose in equivalent of prednisone was calculated for each patient and its effect on osteonecrosis occurrence was studied in multivariate models. Cumulative incidence was 1.4% after chemotherapy alone versus 6.8% after transplantation (P<0.001). A higher cumulative steroid dose, age over ten years at diagnosis, and treatment with transplantation significantly increased the risk of osteonecrosis. A higher post-transplant steroid dose and age over ten years at time of transplantation were significant factors in the transplanted group. With patients grouped according to steroid dose quartile, cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis reached 3.8% in the chemotherapy group for a dose beyond 5835 mg/m(2) and 23.8% after transplantation for a post-transplant dose higher than 2055 mg/m(2). Mean physical composite score of Quality of Life was 44.3 in patients with osteonecrosis versus 54.8% in patients without (P<0.001).

The identification of these mutations and their impact on prognostication has led to improvements in risk-stratification strategies and has also provided new potential targets for the treatment of these myeloid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the most recently identified genetic abnormalities described in MDS and AML and appraise the current status quo of the dynamics of acquisition of mutant alleles in the pathogenesis of AML, during the transformation from MDS to AML, and in the context of relapse after conventional chemotherapy.

The evolution of more virulent pathogens has been classically understood to be limited by the tradeoff between within-host growth rate and transmissibility. Importantly, heterogeneity among hosts can influence both of these factors. However, despite our substantial understanding of how the immune system operates to control pathogen replication during infection, we have only a limited appreciation of how variability in intrinsic (i.e., genetically determined) levels of host resistance influences patterns of pathogen adaptation and virulence evolution. Here, we describe results from experimental evolution studies using a model host-pathogen (virus-mammal) system; we demonstrate that variability in intrinsic levels of resistance among host genotypes can have significant effects on patterns of pathogen adaptation and virulence evolution during serial passage. Both the magnitude of adaptive response as well as the degree of pathogen specialization was positively correlated with host resistance, while mean overall virulence of post-passage virus was negatively correlated with host resistance. These results are consistent with a model whereby resistant host genotypes impose stronger selection on adapting pathogen populations, which in turn leads to the evolution of more specialized pathogen variants whose overall (i.e., mean) virulence across host genotypes is reduced.","['Kubinak, Jason L', 'Potts, Wayne K']","['Kubinak JL', 'Potts WK']","['Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Department of Pathology; School of Medicine, University of Utah; Salt Lake City, UT USA. drjlkub@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130417,United States,Virulence,Virulence,101531386,IM,"['*Adaptation, Biological', 'Animals', '*Disease Resistance', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*virology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Models, Biological', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*virology', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Serial Passage', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*virology', 'Virulence']",PMC3714133,2013/05/07 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['24724 [pii]', '10.4161/viru.24724 [doi]']",ppublish,Virulence. 2013 Jul 1;4(5):410-8. doi: 10.4161/viru.24724.

METHODS: We used real-time quantitative PCR to serially quantitize TRX-2 expression levels in the bone marrow of AL patients at diagnosis (n=68), at complete hematologic remission (CHR, n=57) and at relapse (n=25). Another 25 normal donors served as normal controls. The upper limit of the bone marrow at 91 was regarded as the reference. TRX-2 expression level at CHR with <5% blast cells in the bone marrow of relapse patients was analyzed and compared with MRD by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The TRX-2 levels between the CHR patients and newly diagnosed patients, and between the CHR patients and the relapse patients had significant difference. TRX-2 expression level of 21(21/25) relapse patients at CHR with <5% blast cells in the bone marrow was higher than the reference (>91). TRX-2 level was correlated to the expression level of MRD. CONCLUSION: TRX-2 may be the marker for AL and used in MRD monitoring.","['Luo, Qiong', 'Huang, Zhixin', 'Luo, Liuping', 'Xiao, Dingzhang']","['Luo Q', 'Huang Z', 'Luo L', 'Xiao D']","['Department of Hematology, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

In spite of an induction of apoptosis by both drugs separately and a synergistic effect of them on hTERT down-regulation and telomerase inhibition, the ATO-induced cytotoxicity was reduced when it was used in combination with AZT. AZT attenuated the ATO effects on viability, metabolic activity, DNA synthesis, and apoptosis. These observations, despite the deflection from the main goal of this study, dedicate an especial opportunity to elucidate the importance of some of the mechanisms that have been suggested by which ATO induces apoptosis. Cell cycle distribution, ROS level, and caspase-3 activation analyses suggest that AZT reduced the ATO-induced cytotoxic effect possibly via relative induction and diminution of cells accumulated in (G1, S) and (G2/M) phase, respectively, as well as through attenuation of ROS generation and subsequent caspase-3 inhibition. QRT-PCR assay revealed that induction of p21expression by the combined AZT/ATO compared to ATO alone could be a reason for the relative decline of cells accumulation in G2/M and the increase of cells in G1 and S phases. Therefore, the G2/M arrest and ROS generation are likely principle mediators for the ATO-induced apoptosis and can be used as a guide to design rational combinatorial strategies involving ATO and agents with G2/M arrest or ROS generation capacity to intensify ATO-induced apoptosis.","['Hassani, Saeed', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Zaker, Farhad', 'Mirzaee, Rohellah', 'Mardani, Hajar', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Zekri, Ali', 'Yousefi, Meysam', 'Zaghal, Azam', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Hassani S', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Zaker F', 'Mirzaee R', 'Mardani H', 'Bashash D', 'Zekri A', 'Yousefi M', 'Zaghal A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130505,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*biosynthesis', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']",,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1763-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Sep;92(9):1207-20. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1763-8.

Although population-based studies indicate that treated patients' survival is better than those who are not treated, there is an understandable reluctance of physicians to choose aggressive therapy. Even in this older population 40-60% CR rates are achievable. Several scoring systems and web-based programs help to predict TRM and CR rates. These sources can assist physicians in the difficult decision-making process of aggressive therapy in an individual patient. Clofarabine and hypomethylating agents are reasonable options and can induce CR in patients who cannot receive standard induction with anthracyclines and cytarabine. Despite encouraging CR rates, median survival remains short (<12 months) in elderly AML patients. Even those patients achieving CR have limited long-term survival ( approximately 20% at 3 years) without allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). AlloHCT is feasible and can provide approximately 40% survival at 2 years in appropriately selected patients. Although increased age is associated with poorer survival, higher comorbidities and poor performance status have more negative impact than age per se. The short duration of CR demands that leukemia and transplant physicians collaborate immediately after diagnosis to move quickly toward alloHCT. This collaboration is also essential to choosing the right individuals to transplant and to bridging post-remission therapy (intermediate-dose cytarabine, a hypomethylating agent or FLT-3 inhibitor) in this sometimes frail population. Future studies should be designed not only to address who should receive alloHCT, but also to improve our understanding of AML biology and the process of its cure.","['Ustun, C', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Weisdorf, D']","['Ustun C', 'Lazarus HM', 'Weisdorf D']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130506,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2013/05/07 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201367 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2013.67 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 Nov;48(12):1497-505. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2013.67.

The discovery was made during the Cultural Revolution when most Chinese scientists and doctors struggled to survive. Beginning with recipes from a countryside practitioner that were vague in applicable diseases, Zhang TingDong and colleagues proposed in the 1970s that a single chemical in the recipe is most effective and that its target is APL. More than 20 years of work by Zhang and colleagues eliminated the confusions about whether and how ATO can be used effectively. Other researchers, first in China and then in the West, followed his lead. Retrospective analysis of data from his own group proved that APL was indeed the most sensitive target. Removal of a trace amount of mercury chloride from the recipe by another group in his hospital proved that only ATO was required. Publication of Western replication in 1998 made the therapy widely accepted, though neither Western, nor Chinese authors of English papers on ATO cited Zhang's papers in the 1970s. This article focuses on the early papers of Zhang, but also suggests it worth further work to validate Chinese reports of ATO treatment of other cancers, and infers that some findings published in Chinese journals are of considerable value to patients and that doctors from other countries can benefit from the clinical experience of Chinese doctors with the largest population of patients.","['Rao, Yi', 'Li, Runhong', 'Zhang, Daqing']","['Rao Y', 'Li R', 'Zhang D']","['Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences at Peking University School of Life Sciences, Beijing 100871, China. yrao@pku.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130506,China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

Whether the motility of nonsolid tumors such as leukemia depends on the deregulated expression of molecules decoding chemotactic signals remains an open question. We identify here the membrane remodeling F-BAR adapter protein Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) as a key regulator of chemotaxis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CIP4 is expressed at abnormally high levels in CLL cells, where it is required for CCL19-induced chemotaxis. Upon CCL19 stimulation of CLL cells, CIP4 associates with GTP-bound Cdc42 and is recruited to the rear of the lamellipodium and along microspikes radiating through the lamellipodium. Consistent with its cellular distribution, CIP4 removal impairs both the assembly of the polarized lamellipodium and directional migration along a diffusible CCL19 gradient. Furthermore, CIP4 depletion results in decreased activation of WASP, but increased activation of PAK1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Notably, p38 MAPK inhibition results in impaired lamellipodium assembly and loss of directional migration. This suggests that CIP4 modulates both the WASP and p38 MAPK pathways to promote lamellipodium assembly and chemotaxis. Overall, our study reveals a critical role of CIP4 in mediating chemotaxis of CLL cells by controlling the dynamics of microspike-containing protrusions and cell steering.","['Malet-Engra, Gema', 'Viaud, Julien', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Farce, Manon', 'Lafouresse, Fanny', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Gaits-Iacovoni, Frederique', 'Scita, Giorgio', 'Dupre, Loic']","['Malet-Engra G', 'Viaud J', 'Ysebaert L', 'Farce M', 'Lafouresse F', 'Laurent G', 'Gaits-Iacovoni F', 'Scita G', 'Dupre L']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1043, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130503,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Chemokine CCL19/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Pseudopodia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein/metabolism', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,2013/05/07 06:00,2014/01/03 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-3564 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3564 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 1;73(11):3412-24. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3564.

Most LMNA mutations affect skeletal and cardiac muscle by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Loss of structural function and altered interaction of mutant lamins with (tissue-specific) transcription factors have been proposed to explain the tissue-specific phenotypes. Here we report in mice that lamin-A/C-deficient (Lmna(-/-)) and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells have impaired nuclear translocation and downstream signalling of the mechanosensitive transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukaemia 1 (MKL1), a myocardin family member that is pivotal in cardiac development and function. Altered nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of MKL1 was caused by altered actin dynamics in Lmna(-/-) and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin, which is mislocalized in Lmna mutant cells and also linked to EDMD and DCM, restored MKL1 nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells. These findings present a novel mechanism that could provide insight into the disease aetiology for the cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal actin polymerization.","['Ho, Chin Yee', 'Jaalouk, Diana E', 'Vartiainen, Maria K', 'Lammerding, Jan']","['Ho CY', 'Jaalouk DE', 'Vartiainen MK', 'Lammerding J']","['Cornell University, Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology/Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20130505,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Actins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heart/growth & development', 'Lamin Type A/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",PMC3666313,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2012/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['nature12105 [pii]', '10.1038/nature12105 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2013 May 23;497(7450):507-11. doi: 10.1038/nature12105.

Aberrant epigenetic modifications, including altered DNA methylation, seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of these patients. In fact, hypomethylating agents (HMA) like azacitidine have been successfully used in clinical trials and achieved approval from health authorities. There is now growing evidence suggesting that the combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action might offer a potential benefit to these patients. This is especially done with the intention to synergize the positive effects of each drug on the defective hematopoiesis while sparing potential side effects and toxicities. Combination of HMA with histone deacetylase inhibitors, although mechanistically very tempting, have not yielded convincing improvement of the results in the majority of trials compared to single agent HMA treatment. Currently, combination therapies of azacitidine with lenalidomide appear to be promising thus making them an appealing option for treatment in these patients.","['Platzbecker, U', 'Germing, U']","['Platzbecker U', 'Germing U']","['Technical University, Dresden, Germany. uwe.platzbecker@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130506,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013140 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.140 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Sep;27(9):1813-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.140.

On univariate analysis, adverse factors for OS included active disease at the time of first HSCT and short time to progression from first HSCT (<6 months). There was no difference in the 6-month survival postrelapse in patients with isolated extramedullary relapse (44%) compared with combined extramedullary and bone marrow relapse (29%) or those with isolated bone marrow relapse (34%) (P = .8).

It is mostly associated with advanced age, but also with prior cancer therapy and inherited syndromes related to abnormalities in DNA repair. Recent technologic advances have led to the identification of a myriad of frequently occurring genomic perturbations associated with MDS. These observations suggest that MDS and its progression to acute myeloid leukemia is a genomic instability disorder, resulting from a stepwise accumulation of genetic abnormalities. The notion is now emerging that the underlying mechanism of this disease could be a defect in one or more pathways that are involved in responding to or repairing damaged DNA. In this review, we discuss these pathways in relationship to a large number of studies performed with MDS patient samples and MDS mouse models. Moreover, in view of our current understanding of how DNA damage response and repair pathways are affected by age in hematopoietic stem cells, we also explore how this might relate to MDS development.","['Zhou, Ting', 'Hasty, Paul', 'Walter, Christi A', 'Bishop, Alexander J R', 'Scott, Linda M', 'Rebel, Vivienne I']","['Zhou T', 'Hasty P', 'Walter CA', 'Bishop AJ', 'Scott LM', 'Rebel VI']","[""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130430,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Disease Progression', 'Genomic Instability', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology']",PMC3729593,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00170-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Aug;41(8):665-74. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.04.008.

However, the methodology for analytical evaluation of intracellular drug concentration is rare and usually reliant upon the use of radioactively labeled drugs. More specifically, there is no published method available in the literature for the determination of imatinib concentration in granulocytes. To gain further insight into the intracellular drug uptake a very reliable two-stage sample concentration procedure was devised and coupled with a sensitive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The reliability of this sample preparation and sensitivity of the analysis was confirmed by a successful validation of all necessary method parameters to an impressive lower limit of quantification of 0.5 ng imatinib per 10(6) cells still at the signal to noise ratio of 670. The usefulness of the method is further improved with only 6 mL of blood being necessary for patient analysis. The method has been applied to blood samples of 13 CML patients treated with imatinib and all the measured intracellular drug concentrations were within the validated range. These and further measurements will enable the research of factors which may, besides blood plasma concentration, influence the individual's response to imatinib therapy. Furthermore, individualisation of dosing based on the directly measured targeted drug delivery could be possible.","['Kralj, Eva', 'Zakelj, Simon', 'Trontelj, Jurij', 'Pajic, Tadej', 'Preloznik Zupan, Irena', 'Cernelc, Peter', 'Ostanek, Barbara', 'Marc, Janja', 'Kristl, Albin']","['Kralj E', 'Zakelj S', 'Trontelj J', 'Pajic T', 'Preloznik Zupan I', 'Cernelc P', 'Ostanek B', 'Marc J', 'Kristl A']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Askerceva cesta 7, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130502,Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Calibration', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/instrumentation/methods', 'Drug Monitoring/instrumentation/*methods', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Limit of Detection', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/instrumentation/methods']",,2013/05/07 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0928-0987(13)00169-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2013.04.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2013 Sep 27;50(1):123-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2013.04.026.

Rrm2b, a key enzyme in de novo deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, is involved in DNA damage repair, but its role in cancer development has yet to be demonstrated. In this work, Rrm2b gene loss led to severe numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities that caused ATM activation, inducing p-Ser85 IKKgamma/NEMO and IkappaB kinase (IKK). NF-kappaB consequently induced by IKK triggered sustained IL-6 expression that constitutively activated STAT3 in Rrm2b-deficient cells. High plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and associated hematologic disorders were observed in Rrm2b-/- mice, and 30%-40% of aged Rrm2b heterozygous knockout mice developed plasma cell neoplasms and suffered from progressive splenomegaly and ascites. The genetic ablation of IL-6 suppressed STAT3 induction and delayed disease onset in Rrm2b-/- mice, extending their lifespan. Thus, Rrm2b plays a crucial role in maintaining chromosomal stability and preventing chronic-inflammation-associated tumorigenesis.","['Chang, Lufen', 'Guo, Robin', 'Huang, Qin', 'Yen, Yun']","['Chang L', 'Guo R', 'Huang Q', 'Yen Y']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. lchang@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130502,United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chemokine CCL2/metabolism', '*Chromosomal Instability', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",PMC3672259,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2012/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-1247(13)00164-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2013 May 30;3(5):1389-97. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.040.

Induced neural progenitor (iNP) colonies appeared as early as day 13 and can be expanded for >20 passages. Under the same defined condition, no induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colonies formed at either 37 degrees C or 39 degrees C. The iNPs predominantly express hindbrain genes and differentiate into hindbrain neurons, and when caudalized, they produced an enriched population of spinal motor neurons. Following transplantation into the forebrain, the iNP-derived cells retained the hindbrain identity. The ability to generate defined, integration-free iNPs from adult primate fibroblasts under a defined condition with predictable fate choices will facilitate disease modeling and therapeutic development.","['Lu, Jianfeng', 'Liu, Huisheng', 'Huang, Cindy Tzu-Ling', 'Chen, Hong', 'Du, Zhongwei', 'Liu, Yan', 'Sherafat, Mohammad Amin', 'Zhang, Su-Chun']","['Lu J', 'Liu H', 'Huang CT', 'Chen H', 'Du Z', 'Liu Y', 'Sherafat MA', 'Zhang SC']","['Department of Neuroscience, School of Medicine and Public Health, Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130502,United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dioxoles/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/drug effects', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/transplantation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Neural Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Neuroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Prosencephalon/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Rhombencephalon/metabolism', 'Temperature']",PMC3786191,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-1247(13)00171-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.celrep.2013.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2013 May 30;3(5):1580-91. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2013.04.004.

The core matures by cleavage of PrGag into MA (matrix), p12, CA (capsid) and NC (nucleocapsid) protein. We found that mature Gag proteins were bound to the PrGag cores. The degree of binding differed widely. No (<0.1%) p12 bound, low amount of CA (3-5%), and higher amount of MA (13-20%) bound. Varying NC was bound (5-15%). NC could be released by RNase A in agreement with its binding to viral RNA. The TM (transmembrane) protein was also examined. A low amount of TM was bound to the PrGag core (approximately 5%), whereas a very high amount (65%) of the PreTM (TM with the cytoplasmic R peptide tail) bound.

In multivariable analysis, higher peripheral blood blast counts on admission (p=0.04) as well as higher body mass index (p=0.003) were associated with developing DS. Out of the 29 patients with DS, there were 4 early deaths of which 2 were attributed to DS compared to no early deaths in the patients who did not develop DS (p=0.05).

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors who receive Anth-bC experience premature CV events. It is unknown whether low to moderate doses of anthracyclines promote early subclinical CV disease manifested by deteriorations in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or increases in aortic stiffness, or if these doses are associated with changes in quality of life (QOL). METHODS: In 53 men and women with breast cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma, we assessed left ventricular volumes, LVEF, circumferential strain, aortic pulse wave velocity, late gadolinium enhancement, serum B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin I, and the impact of treatment on QOL before and 1, 3, and 6 months after receipt of Anth-bC. RESULTS: Participants averaged 50 +/- 2 (range 19 to 80) years in age, 58% were women, 17% were black, and they each received a range of 50 to 375 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin-equivalent chemotherapy. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (48 +/- 3 ml to 54 +/- 3 ml; p = 0.02), left ventricular strain (-17.7 +/- 0.4 to -15.1 +/- 0.4; p = 0.0003), pulse wave velocity (6.7 +/- 0.5 m/s to 10.1 +/- 1 m/s; p = 0.0006), and QOL deterioration (15.4 +/- 3.3 to 28.5 +/- 3.9; p = 0.008) increased, whereas LVEF (58 +/- 1% to 53 +/- 1%; p = 0.0002) decreased within 6 months after low to moderate doses of Anth-bC. All findings persisted after accounting for age, gender, race (white/black), doxorubicin-equivalent dose, doxorubicin administration technique, comorbidities associated with CV events, and cancer diagnosis (p = 0.02 to 0.0001 for all).

METHODS: In a large population-based case-control study of myeloid leukemia that included 414 AML and 185 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases and 692 controls ages 20-79 years, we evaluated risk associated with cigarette smoking and smoking cessation using unconditional logistic regression methods and cubic spline modeling. RESULTS: AML and CML risk increased with increasing cigarette smoking intensity in men and women. A monotonic decrease in AML risk was observed with increasing time since quitting, whereas for CML, the risk reduction was more gradual. For both AML and CML, among long-term quitters (>/=30 years), risk was comparable to non-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the increased risk of myeloid leukemia with cigarette smoking and provides encouraging evidence of risk attenuation following cessation.","['Musselman, Jessica R B', 'Blair, Cindy K', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Nguyen, Phuong', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Musselman JR', 'Blair CK', 'Cerhan JR', 'Nguyen P', 'Hirsch B', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. bruce087@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130502,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Risk', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/epidemiology', 'Smoking Cessation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3819424,2013/05/07 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(13)00045-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2013.03.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2013 Aug;37(4):410-6. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2013.03.012.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of malignant disorders and mortality among a cohort of Israelis diagnosed as HTLV-1 carriers during routine blood unit screening. METHODS: This was an observational retrospective cohort study. All HTLV-1 cases among Israeli blood donors between 1995 and 2009 were included. Data regarding malignant diseases were extracted from the Israel National Cancer Registry. Mortality data were extracted from the Israel Population Registry. RESULTS: Between January 9, 1995 and December 31, 2009, 1574497 blood donors were screened for HTLV-1 in the central blood bank services. Of these, 90 were found to be HTLV-1 carriers. This cohort of HTLV-1-infected blood donors was followed for an average of 9.2 +/- 6 years. Among them six (6.7%) were diagnosed as having malignant diseases, four of them with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).

To define the early embryonic cell population that responds to Mesp1, we performed pulse inductions of gene expression over tight temporal windows following embryonic stem cell differentiation. Remarkably, instead of promoting cardiac differentiation in the initial wave of mesoderm, Mesp1 binds to the Tal1 (Scl) +40 kb enhancer and generates Flk-1+ precursors expressing Etv2 (ER71) and Tal1 that undergo hematopoietic differentiation. The second wave of mesoderm responds to Mesp1 by differentiating into PDGFRalpha+ precursors that undergo cardiac differentiation. Furthermore, in the absence of serum-derived factors, Mesp1 promotes skeletal myogenic differentiation. Lineage tracing revealed that the majority of yolk sac and many adult hematopoietic cells derive from Mesp1+ precursors. Thus, Mesp1 is a context-dependent determination factor, integrating the stage of differentiation and the signaling environment to specify different lineage outcomes.","['Chan, Sunny Sun-Kin', 'Shi, Xiaozhong', 'Toyama, Akira', 'Arpke, Robert W', 'Dandapat, Abhijit', 'Iacovino, Michelina', 'Kang, Jinjoo', 'Le, Gengyun', 'Hagen, Hannah R', 'Garry, Daniel J', 'Kyba, Michael']","['Chan SS', 'Shi X', 'Toyama A', 'Arpke RW', 'Dandapat A', 'Iacovino M', 'Kang J', 'Le G', 'Hagen HR', 'Garry DJ', 'Kyba M']","['Lillehei Heart Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,IM,"['Aging/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Pairing/genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Body Patterning', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Heart/*embryology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/*embryology', 'Mesoderm/cytology/*embryology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred mdx', 'Muscle Development', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*embryology/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle/metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Yolk Sac/metabolism']",PMC3646300,2013/05/07 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2012/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(13)00099-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2013.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2013 May 2;12(5):587-601. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2013.03.004.,5,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (ER71 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mesp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,"['R01 AR055685/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AR007612/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL069764/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL100407/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS459472'],['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To date, robust self-renewing ESC states have only been obtained through the chemical inhibition of signaling pathways or enforced transgene expression. Here, we show that ESCs with reduced Oct4 expression resulting from heterozygosity also exhibit a stabilized pluripotent state. Despite having reduced Oct4 expression, Oct4(+/-) ESCs show increased genome-wide binding of Oct4, particularly at pluripotency-associated enhancers, homogeneous expression of pluripotency transcription factors, enhanced self-renewal efficiency, and delayed differentiation kinetics. Cells also exhibit increased Wnt expression, enhanced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) sensitivity, and reduced responsiveness to fibroblast growth factor. Although they are able to maintain pluripotency in the absence of bone morphogenetic protein, removal of LIF destabilizes pluripotency. Our findings suggest that cells with a reduced Oct4 concentration range are maintained in a robust pluripotent state and that the wild-type Oct4 concentration range enables effective differentiation.","['Karwacki-Neisius, Violetta', 'Goke, Jonathan', 'Osorno, Rodrigo', 'Halbritter, Florian', 'Ng, Jia Hui', 'Weisse, Andrea Y', 'Wong, Frederick C K', 'Gagliardi, Alessia', 'Mullin, Nicholas P', 'Festuccia, Nicola', 'Colby, Douglas', 'Tomlinson, Simon R', 'Ng, Huck-Hui', 'Chambers, Ian']","['Karwacki-Neisius V', 'Goke J', 'Osorno R', 'Halbritter F', 'Ng JH', 'Weisse AY', 'Wong FC', 'Gagliardi A', 'Mullin NP', 'Festuccia N', 'Colby D', 'Tomlinson SR', 'Ng HH', 'Chambers I']","['MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Institute for Stem Cell Research, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, 5 Little France Drive, Edinburgh EH16 4UU, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Serum', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3650585,2013/05/07 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2012/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(13)00159-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2013.04.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2013 May 2;12(5):531-45. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2013.04.023.,5,,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",,,"['G0901533/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

About 5-10% of CML cases show variant translocations with the involvement of other chromosomes in addition to chromosomes 9 and 22. The molecular bases of biological differences between CML patients with classic and variant t(9;22) have never been clarified. FINDINGS: In this study, we performed gene expression microarray analysis to compare CML patients bearing variant rearrangements and those with classic t(9;22)(q34;q11). We identified 59 differentially expressed genes significantly associated with the two analyzed groups. The role of specific candidate genes such as TRIB1 (tribbles homolog 1), PTK2B (protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta), and C5AR1 (complement component 5a receptor 1) is discussed.

For many years scientists and doctors have been working on introducing the most effective therapy into CLL as prognosis of survival time and the course of the disease differ among patients, which might pose a problem in treating. Nanotechnology is providing new insights into diagnosis and, compared with conventional treatments, more efficient treatments, which might improve patients' comfort by decreasing side effects. Among the various nanoparticles that are available, dendrimers are one of the most promising. The aim of this study was a preliminary assessment of the clinical value of treating CLL patients with fourth generation poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimers-either unmodified (PPI-G4) or approximately 90% maltotriose-modified (PPI-G4-DS-Mal-III). PPI-G4-DS-Mal-III dendrimers have, in contrast to the cationic PPI-G4, a neutral surface charge and are characterized by low cyto-, geno-, and hematotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro study we used blood mononuclear cells collected from both untreated CLL patients and from healthy donors. Apoptosis was measured by an annexin-V (Ann-V)/propidium iodide (IP) assay, and mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated with use of Mito Tracker Red CMXRos. Presented results confirm the influence of dendrimers PPI-G4 and PPI-G4-DS-Mal-III on apoptosis and CLL lymphocytes viability in in vitro cultures. Both tested dendrimers demonstrated higher cytotoxicity to CLL cells than to healthy donors cells, whereas unmodified dendrimers were more hematotoxic. The surface modification clearly makes glycodendrimers much more suitable for biomedical applications than unmodified PPI-G4; therefore further biological evaluations of these nanoparticles are conducted in our laboratories.","['Franiak-Pietryga, Ida', 'Ziolkowska, Ewelina', 'Ziemba, Barbara', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Voit, Brigitte', 'Szewczyk, Michal', 'Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Klajnert, Barbara', 'Bryszewska, Maria']","['Franiak-Pietryga I', 'Ziolkowska E', 'Ziemba B', 'Appelhans D', 'Voit B', 'Szewczyk M', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Robak T', 'Klajnert B', 'Bryszewska M']","['Laboratory of Clinical and Transplant Immunology and Genetics, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendrimers/adverse effects/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Polypropylenes/*chemistry', 'Trisaccharides/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/05/07 06:00,2014/01/16 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp400142p [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2013 Jun 3;10(6):2490-501. doi: 10.1021/mp400142p.

Still, we are far away from having seen and described all possible genetic changes associated with this kind of acquired disease. RESULTS: Bone marrow cells of a female patient with clinical diagnoses of AML and immunophenotypically confirmed AML-M4 were studied by GTG-banding. The later was not able to resolve all karyotypic changes and the complex karyotype was characterized in more detail by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array-proven multicolor banding (aMCB). To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the only one ever seen with a del(5)(q14q34), a der(17)t(4;17)(p13;p13), a del(2)(p23), a der(4)t(4;7)(p13;q11.23), a der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) and two complex rearranged chromosomes 11 involving chromosomes 7 and 22 as well as 2. CONCLUSIONS: The yet unreported breakpoints observed in this case seem to be correlated with an adverse prognosis.

BLV infection may remain clinically silent at the aleukemic (AL) stage, cause persistent lymphocytosis (PL), or, more rarely, B cell lymphoma. BLV has been identified in B cells, CD2+ T cells, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, gamma/delta T cells, monocytes, and granulocytes in infected cattle that do not have tumors, although the most consistently infected cell is the CD5+ B cell. The mechanism by which BLV causes uncontrolled CD5+ B cell proliferation is unknown. Recently, we developed a new quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR, which enabled us to demonstrate that the proviral load correlates not only with BLV infection, as assessed by syncytium formation, but also with BLV disease progression. The present study reports the distribution of BLV provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subpopulations isolated from BLV-infected cows at the subclinical stage of EBL as examined by cell sorting and BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR. RESULTS: Phenotypic characterization of five BLV-infected but clinically normal cattle with a proviral load of > 100 copies per 1 x 105 cells identified a high percentage of CD5+ IgM+ cells (but not CD5- IgM+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, or CD8+T cells). These lymphocyte subpopulations were purified from three out of five cattle by cell sorting or using magnetic beads, and the BLV proviral load was estimated using BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR. The CD5+ IgM+ B cell population in all animals harbored a higher BLV proviral load than the other cell populations. The copy number of proviruses infecting CD5- IgM+ B cells, CD4+ cells, and CD8+ T cells (per 1 ml of blood) was 1/34 to 1/4, 1/22 to 1/3, and 1/31 to 1/3, respectively, compared with that in CD5+ IgM+ B cells. Moreover, the BLV provirus remained integrated into the genomic DNA of CD5+ IgM+ B cells, CD5- IgM+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells, even in BLV-infected cattle with a proviral load of <100 copies per 105 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the recent study showed that, although CD5+ IgM+ B cells were the main cell type targeted in BLV-infected but clinically normal cattle, CD5- IgM+ B cells, CD4+ cells, and CD8+ T cells were infected to a greater extent than previously thought.","['Panei, Carlos Javier', 'Takeshima, Shin-nosuke', 'Omori, Takashi', 'Nunoya, Tetsuo', 'Davis, William C', 'Ishizaki, Hiroshi', 'Matoba, Kazuhiro', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Panei CJ', 'Takeshima SN', 'Omori T', 'Nunoya T', 'Davis WC', 'Ishizaki H', 'Matoba K', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130504,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,IM,"['Animals', 'Asymptomatic Infections', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'CD5 Antigens/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Proviruses/*physiology', 'Viral Load/veterinary']",PMC3648496,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1746-6148-9-95 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-6148-9-95 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2013 May 4;9:95. doi: 10.1186/1746-6148-9-95.,,,['0 (CD5 Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we analyzed the frequency and characteristics of musculoskeletal complaints as the initial presenting symptoms of newly diagnosed leukaemia and lymphoma patients in the past 10 years in our clinic. METHODS: Using the Hungarian Tumour Register, we performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 166 new leukaemia and 95 new lymphoma pediatric patients treated from 1999 to 2009 at the 2nd. Dept. of Paediatrics of the Semmelweis University in Budapest. RESULTS: Twenty percent of the leukaemic (33 children) and 2% of the lymphoma patients (2 children) had musculoskeletal symptoms at first presentation. Two-thirds of both groups of patients had other general symptoms like fever and/or fatigue. The hip was the most frequently affected joint (7/33) in the leukaemic patients. Twenty-four percent of all the children had been previously evaluated by an orthopaedist; 12% had visited another rheumatologist prior to diagnosis. Imaging had been done in an unexpectedly low number of patients prior to referral to our unit (radiographs: 16 or 48%, ultrasound: 5 patients or 15%). Radiographs of the affected joints were abnormal in only one case (1/16, 6%). The joint ultrasound was abnormal in only three children of 5 studied (3/5, 60%). Anaemia (26/32, 6%), thrombocytopenia (78%) and LDH elevation (3-4 times the normal count) were frequent in the leukaemic patients. Half of the cases had a normal leukocyte count. The lymphoma group had similar results. Two patients of the leukaemia group received steroid treatment before the final diagnosis. Severe pain out of proportion to physical findings is another clue. CONCLUSIONS: Haematologic malignancies must be excluded before initiation of therapy for childhood arthritis among children presenting with musculoskeletal signs and symptoms, particularly in atypical cases. Malignancies are to be suspected when pain is disproportionately severe compared to the physical examination findings, and when anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated LDH level are present. Diagnosing leukaemia early is important because the use of steroids and immunosuppressive medications may mask and delay its diagnosis. Additionally, pre-treatment of presumed JIA patients with these drugs who eventually are diagnosed to have a malignancy may lead to the malignancy being steroid-resistant and more difficult to treat.","['Zombori, Luca', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Csoka, Monika', 'Derfalvi, Beata']","['Zombori L', 'Kovacs G', 'Csoka M', 'Derfalvi B']","['2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University Budapest, 1094, Tuzolto u 7-9, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University Budapest, 1094, Tuzolto u 7-9, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University Budapest, 1094, Tuzolto u 7-9, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University Budapest, 1094, Tuzolto u 7-9, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130504,England,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,Pediatric rheumatology online journal,101248897,,,PMC3645950,2013/05/07 06:00,2013/05/07 06:01,['2013/05/07 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/1546-0096-11-20 [doi]', '1546-0096-11-20 [pii]']",epublish,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J. 2013 May 4;11:20. doi: 10.1186/1546-0096-11-20. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood', 'Idiopathic arthritis', 'Juvenile', 'Leukaemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Musculoskeletal complaints']",,,,,,,

Among different molecular anticancer activities of epigenetic active substances, up-regulation of natural killer (NK) cell ligands was described to contribute to an enhanced NK cell-mediated killing of tumor cell lines. So far, no data is available on this effect in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We investigated the effect of two HDACi [vorinostat, valproic acid (VPA)] and two DNMTi (azacytidine, decitabine) on the viability, expression of NK ligands, and NK susceptibility of the pre-B-cell-ALL cell line MHH-CALL-4. Whereas vorinostat, azacytidine, and decitabine directly reduced viability of the cell line, VPA had no direct cytotoxic effect. NKG2D-ligands were expressed only at very low levels and not affected by epigenetic treatment. Higher expression was found for the DNAM-1 ligands with significant up regulation of CD112 after treatment with VPA (p = 0.02). No significant increase in lysis mediated by resting NK cells could be observed, whereas incubation of target cells with decitabine resulted in a significant increase in lysis mediated by IL-2 activated NK cells (p = 0.0051, p = 0.06 for azacytidine). Vorinostat and VPA could increase the lysis by expanded NK cells which was statistically not significant due to high inter-individual variability. Furthermore, HDACi but not DNMTi reduced the NK-mediated lysis of MHH-CALL-4 after incubation of effector cells. In conclusion, there is a synergistic effect between epigenetic drugs and NK cells against MHH-CALL-4 which is not as strong as in other tumor entities. In situations where NK-mediated control of leukemia is assumed or wanted, a sophisticated combination of single epigenetic drugs and ex vivo expanded NK cells is needed to maximize the synergistic effect of both treatment strategies and DNMTIs may be preferred based on the direct inhibitory effect of HDACi on NK cell cytotoxicity.","['Pfeiffer, Matthias Manuel', 'Burow, Helen', 'Schleicher, Sabine', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Lang, Peter']","['Pfeiffer MM', 'Burow H', 'Schleicher S', 'Handgretinger R', 'Lang P']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen Tuebingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130429,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,PMC3638146,2013/05/04 06:00,2013/05/04 06:01,['2013/05/04 06:00'],"['2013/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00099 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 Apr 29;3:99. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00099. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMTi', 'HDACi', 'NK cells', 'immunotherapy', 'pediatric lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,

The model has the form of a multitype branching process. We derive equations for the distributions of the times to consecutive driver mutations and set up simulations involving a range of hypotheses regarding acceleration of the mutation rates in successive mutant clones. Our model reproduces the clinical distribution of times at diagnosis of secondary AML. Surprisingly, within the framework of our assumptions, stochasticity of the mutation process is incapable of explaining the spread of times at diagnosis of AML in this case; it is necessary to additionally assume a wide spread of proliferative parameters among disease cases.

The free sialic acid concentrations in both blood and ascites were measured in tumor-bearing mice. The results showed that the content of sialic acids in blood was increased in tumor growth and certain tumor types. Higher sialic acid content was observed in ascites than that present in blood. The influence of antineoplastic agents (vincristine, thiotepa, adriamycin, probimane, cisplatin, oxalysine, cortisone, nitrogen mustard, lycobetaine, Ara-C, harringtonine, and cyclophosphamide) on the content of sialic acids in mice blood bearing solid tumors of either S180 or Lewis lung carcinoma was observed. Different inhibitions of antineoplastic drugs on both tumor growth and serum sialic acid levels in mice bearing tumors were found. Among these antineoplastic drugs, probimane, cisplatin, nitrogen mustard, and lycobetaine were able to decrease the serum sialic acid levels in mice bearing tumors. Since these four antineoplastic drugs are all DNA chelating agents, it was proposed that the inhibition of tumor sialic acids by these drugs might be through the DNA template via two ways. Since we have found no effect of antineoplastic drugs on serum sialic acid levels in normal mice, this suggests that the inhibition of antineoplastic drugs on sialic acids is by tumor involvement.","['Lu, Da-Yong', 'Xu, Jing', 'Lu, Ting-Ren', 'Wu, Hong-Ying', 'Xu, Bin']","['Lu DY', 'Xu J', 'Lu TR', 'Wu HY', 'Xu B']","['School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121114,Switzerland,Sci Pharm,Scientia pharmaceutica,0026251,,,PMC3617655,2013/05/04 06:00,2013/05/04 06:01,['2013/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3797/scipharm.1209-18 [doi]', 'scipharm-2013-81-223 [pii]']",ppublish,Sci Pharm. 2013 Jan-Mar;81(1):223-31. doi: 10.3797/scipharm.1209-18.

Here we demonstrated for the first time that human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is a promising therapeutic target for ATL, and we developed a novel redirected T-cell-based immunotherapy targeting hTERT. hTERT messenger RNA was produced abundantly in ATL tumor cells but not in steady-state normal cells. Rearranged human leukocyte antigen-A*24:02 (HLA-A*24:02) -restricted and hTERT461-469 nonameric peptide-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha/beta genes were cloned from our previously established cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone (K3-1) and inserted into a novel retroviral TCR expression vector encoding small interfering RNAs for endogenous TCR genes in redirected T cells (hTERT-siTCR vector). Consequently, allogeneic or autologous gene-modified CD8(+) T cells prepared using the hTERT-siTCR vector successfully killed ATL tumor cells, but not normal cells including steady-state hematopoietic progenitors, in an HLA-A*24:02-restricted manner both in vitro and in vivo. Our experimental observations support the development of a novel hTERT-targeting redirected T-cell-based adoptive immunotherapy for ATL patients, especially those for whom suitable allo-HSCT donors are lacking.","['Miyazaki, Yukihiro', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Asai, Hiroaki', 'Ochi, Fumihiro', 'Ochi, Toshiki', 'Azuma, Taichi', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Okamoto, Sachiko', 'Mineno, Junichi', 'Kuzushima, Kiyotaka', 'Shiku, Hiroshi', 'Yasukawa, Masaki']","['Miyazaki Y', 'Fujiwara H', 'Asai H', 'Ochi F', 'Ochi T', 'Azuma T', 'Ishida T', 'Okamoto S', 'Mineno J', 'Kuzushima K', 'Shiku H', 'Yasukawa M']","['Department of Bioregulatory Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130502,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Female', 'HLA-A24 Antigen/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptides/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Telomerase/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2013/05/04 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/05/04 06:00'],"['2013/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57284-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-465971 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 13;121(24):4894-901. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-465971.

This includes proteins involved in the modification of DNA cytosine residues and enzymes which catalyze posttranslational modifications of histones. Here we describe the clinical, biological, and therapeutic relevance of mutations in epigenetic regulators in AML. In particular, we focus on the role of loss-of-function mutations in TET2, gain-of-function mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, and loss-of-function mutations in ASXL1 and mutations of unclear impact in DNMT3A in AML pathogenesis and therapy. Multiple studies have consistently identified that mutations in these genes have prognostic relevance, particularly in intermediate-risk AML patients, arguing for inclusion of mutational testing of these genetic abnormalities in routine clinical practice. Moreover, biochemical, biological, and epigenomic analyses of the effects of these mutations have informed the development of novel therapies which target pathways deregulated by these mutations. Our understanding of the effects of these mutations on hematopoiesis and potential for therapeutic targeting of specific AML subsets is also reviewed here.","['Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Abdel-Wahab O', 'Levine RL']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, and Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genes, Modifier/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",PMC3643757,2013/05/04 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2013/05/04 06:00'],"['2013/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58703-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-451781 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 2;121(18):3563-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-451781.,18,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",,,"['K08 CA160647/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K08CA160647-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, paclitaxel and doxorubicin coencapsulated in the peptide beads were delivered to THP-1 monocytes, causing a decrease in cell viability due to the activity of the anticancer drugs. In addition to the bead-forming peptide Ac-X3-gT, the use of a positively charged peptide analogue increased the RNA/DNA embedding efficiency to 99% by charge compensation and micellar complexation. Internalization of the resulting gene delivery systems by Huh7 cells led to specific gene silencing either by embedded small interfering RNA or by plasmid-encoding small hairpin RNA delivered in cells.

Associations for disease subtypes are uncertain. METHODS: A cohort of 1.3 million middle-aged U.K. women was recruited in 1996-2001 and followed for 10 years on average. Potential risk factors were assessed by questionnaire. Death, emigration, and incident cancer were ascertained by linkage to national registers. Adjusted relative risks were estimated by Cox regression. RESULTS: During follow-up, 9162 participants were diagnosed with lymphatic or haematopoietic cancers. Each 10 kg m(-2) increase in body mass index was associated with relative risk of 1.20 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.28) for lymphoid and 1.37 (1.22-1.53) for myeloid malignancy (P=0.06 for heterogeneity); similarly, Hodgkin lymphoma 1.64 (1.21-2.21), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 1.36 (1.17-1.58), plasma cell neoplasms 1.21 (1.06-1.39), acute myeloid leukaemia 1.47 (1.19-1.81), and myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndromes 1.32 (1.15-1.52). Each 10 cm increase in height was associated with relative risk of 1.21 (1.16-1.27) for lymphoid and 1.11 (1.02-1.21) for myeloid malignancy (P=0.07 for heterogeneity); similarly, mature T-cell malignancies 1.36 (1.03-1.79), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 1.28 (1.14-1.43), follicular lymphoma 1.28 (1.13-1.44), plasma cell neoplasms 1.12 (1.01-1.24), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma 1.23 (1.08-1.40), and acute myeloid leukaemia 1.22 (1.04-1.42).

In vitro drug sensitivity assay demonstrated that overexpression of miR-135a/b sensitized A549/CDDP cells to cisplatin. The luciferase activity of MCL1 3'-untranslated region-based reporter constructed in A549/CDDP cells suggested that MCL1 was the direct target gene of miR-135a/b. Enforced miR-135a/b expression reduced MCL1 protein level and sensitized A549/CDDP cells to CDDP-induced apoptosis.

METHODS: We conducted this study among neutropenic children with underlying hematology/oncology diseases who were diagnosed with VSB at a single institution from April 2009 to June 2012. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the children as well as antibiotic susceptibility of the causative viridans streptococci were evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty-seven episodes of VSB were diagnosed in 50 children. Severe complications occurred in four children (7.0%), and a death of one child (1.8%) was attributable to VSB. Acute myeloid leukemia was the most common underlying disease (70.2% of all cases), and 71.9% of all cases received chemotherapy including high-dose cytarabine. VSB occurred at a median of 13 days (range 8-21 days) after the beginning of chemotherapy, and fever lasted for a median of 4 days (range 1-21 days). The C-reactive protein level significantly increased within a week after the occurrence of VSB (p < 0.001) and the maximum C-reactive protein level showed a positive correlation with fever duration (r = 0.362, p = 0.007). Second blood cultures were done before the use of glycopeptides in 33 children, and negative results were observed in 30 children (90.9%). Susceptibilities to cefotaxime, cefepime, and vancomycin were 58.9, 69.1, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Severe complications of VSB in neutropenic febrile children were rare. We suggest glycopeptide use according to the results of blood culture and antibiotic susceptibility tests based on the susceptibility to cefepime and the microbiologic response to empirical antibiotic treatment not including glycopeptides in this study.","['Han, S B', 'Bae, E Y', 'Lee, J W', 'Lee, D G', 'Chung, N G', 'Jeong, D C', 'Cho, B', 'Kang, J H', 'Kim, H K']","['Han SB', 'Bae EY', 'Lee JW', 'Lee DG', 'Chung NG', 'Jeong DC', 'Cho B', 'Kang JH', 'Kim HK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222, Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130503,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Febrile Neutropenia/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'ROC Curve', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Streptococcal Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Viridans Streptococci/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Young Adult']",,2013/05/04 06:00,2014/06/18 06:00,['2013/05/04 06:00'],"['2013/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s15010-013-0470-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2013 Oct;41(5):917-24. doi: 10.1007/s15010-013-0470-7.

However, due to the low incidence of AML, it is not always feasible to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of personalized medicine using clinical trials. Decision analytic models provide an alternative data source. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a decision analytic model that represents the full disease course of AML. METHODS: We used a micro simulation with discrete event components to incorporate both patient and disease heterogeneity. Input parameters were calculated from patient-level data. Two hematologists critically evaluated the model to ensure face validity. Internal and external validity was tested by comparing complete remission (CR) rates and survival outcomes of the model with original data, other clinical trials and a population-based study. RESULTS: No significant differences in patient and treatment characteristics, CR rate, 5-year overall and disease-free survival were found between the simulated and original data. External validation showed no significant differences in survival between simulated data and other clinical trials. However, differences existed between the simulated data and a population-based study. CONCLUSIONS: The model developed in this study is proved to be valid for analysis of an AML population participating in a clinical trial. The generalizability of the model to a broader patient population has not been proven yet. Further research is needed to identify differences between the clinical trial population and other AML patients and to incorporate these differences in the model.","['Leunis, Annemieke', 'Redekop, W Ken', 'van Montfort, Kees A G M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Uyl-de Groot, Carin A']","['Leunis A', 'Redekop WK', 'van Montfort KA', 'Lowenberg B', 'Uyl-de Groot CA']","['Institute for Medical Technology Assessment/Institute of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, PO Box 1738, 3000 DR, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. leunis@bmg.eur.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,"['Adult', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Decision Support Techniques', '*Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Precision Medicine', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,2013/05/04 06:00,2014/06/06 06:00,['2013/05/04 06:00'],"['2013/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40273-013-0058-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2013 Jul;31(7):605-21. doi: 10.1007/s40273-013-0058-1.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the six derivatives, the new I1 and A3 exhibited highest antiproliferative activity with the IC50 values of 5.67-11.02 mumol . L(-1). Cell cycle analysis of Jurkat cells exposed to I1 at a concentration of 30 mumol x L(-1) for 24 h exhibited a mild increase in S and G2/M fraction caused by accumulation of cells. This arrest was followed by an increase in sub-G0/G1 after 48 h of incubation. Jurkat cells exposed to A3 at a concentration of 30 mumol x L(-1) for 24 h showed an increase in G0/G1 fraction and after 48 h an increase in G2/M fraction followed by an increase in sub-G0/G1 after 72 h of incubation. Moreover, the A3 compound was observed to displace the intercalating agent ethidium bromide from calf thymus DNA using fluorescence spectroscopy. The apparent binding constant was estimated to be 3.1 x 10(6) M(-1) what indicates non-intercalating mode of DNA binding. On the other hand, we found no inhibitory effect of studied compounds on topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II activity. Finally, the localization of these compounds in the cells due to their inherent fluorescence was investigated with the fluorescence microscopy. Our results suggest that the naphthalimide polyamine conjugates rapidly penetrate to the cancer cells.

However the mutational spectrum of KRAS gene differs by organ site. In this study, we have analysed the mutational spectrum of KRAS exon 1 in bladder tumours, colorectal cancer (CRC) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A total of 366 patients were included in the present study (234 bladder tumours, 48 CRC and 84 CML). The KRAS mutations are absent in BCR/ABL1 positive CML. This result suggests that BCR/ABL1 fusion gene and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive. The frequency of KRAS mutations in bladder cancer was estimated at 4.27 %. All of mutations were found in codon 12 and 90 % of them were detected in advanced bladder tumours. However the correlation between KRAS mutations and tumour stage and grade does not report a statistical significant association. The KRAS mutations occur in 35.41 % of patients with CRC. The most frequent mutations were G12C, G12D and G13D. These mutations were significantly correlated with histological differentiation of CRC (p = 0.024).

We compared a standard diagnostic strategy (culture and histology) with a rapid biomarker-based diagnostic strategy (aspergillus galactomannan and PCR) for directing the use of antifungal treatment in this group of patients. METHODS: In this open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, eligible patients were adults undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation or chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, with no history of invasive fungal disease. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated schedule to follow either a standard diagnostic strategy (based on culture and histology) or a biomarker-based diagnostic strategy (aspergillus galactomannan and PCR) to direct treatment with antifungal drugs. Patients, were followed up for 26 weeks or until death. Masking of the use of different diagnostic tests was not possible for patients, treating physicians, or investigators. The primary endpoint was empirical treatment with antifungal drugs in the 26 weeks after enrolment (for the biomarker-based diagnostic strategy, a single postive galactomannan or PCR result was deemed insufficient to confirm invasive aspergillosis, so treatment in this context was classified as empirical). This outcome was assessed by an independent data review committee from which the study allocations were masked. Analyses were by intention to treat and included all enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, number NCT00163722. FINDINGS: 240 eligible patients were recruited from six Australian centres between Sept 30, 2005, and Nov 19, 2009. 122 were assigned the standard diagnostic strategy and 118 the biomarker-based diagnostic strategy. 39 patients (32%) in the standard diagnosis group and 18 (15%) in the biomarker diagnosis group received empirical antifungal treatment (difference 17%, 95% CI 4-26; p=0.002). The numbers of patients who had hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects did not differ significantly between the standard diagnosis and biomarker diagnosis groups (hepatotoxic effects: 21 [17%] vs 12 [10%], p=0.11; nephrotoxic effects: 52 [43%] vs 60 [51%], p=0.20). INTERPRETATION: Use of aspergillus galactomannan and PCR to direct treatment reduced use of empirical antifungal treatment. This approach is an effective strategy for the management of invasive aspergillosis in high-risk haematology patients.

Unrestrained activation of oncogenic kinases together with inhibition of tumour suppressors is often required for development of cancer. PP2A has been shown to be genetically altered or functionally inactivated in many solid cancers and leukaemias, and is therefore a tumour suppressor. For example, the phosphatase activity of PP2A is suppressed in chronic myeloid leukaemia and other malignancies characterised by aberrant activity of oncogenic kinases. Preclinical studies show that pharmacological restoration of PP2A tumour-suppressor activity by PP2A-activating drugs (eg, FTY720) effectively antagonises cancer development and progression. Here, we discuss PP2A as a druggable tumour suppressor in view of the possible introduction of PP2A-activating drugs into anticancer therapeutic protocols.","['Perrotti, Danilo', 'Neviani, Paolo']","['Perrotti D', 'Neviani P']","['Human Cancer Genetics Program, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210-2207, USA. danilo.perrotti@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

Using this assay format, clinical samples were first screened to identify potential ADA positive samples, which were then further tested by adding excess drug, confirming the positive signals as drug specific. However, when the method was implemented into clinical studies for ADA testing, a high positive rate was observed in the pre-dose samples collected from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Since the positive signals were not associated with ofatumumab (Ofa) treatment, and diminished after treatment, it was suspected that matrix interference might be responsible, resulting in false-positive responses. We performed a series of experimental investigations to identify, characterize, minimize or eliminate the possible false-positive responses. One possible source was identified to be CD20 (the target of Ofa) present on cell membrane fragments (CMFs). The false-positive responses caused by CD20(+) CMFs could be reduced by solid-phase immunodepletion, ultracentrifugation, or inhibited by adding another anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab). As a consequence, the ADA method was modified to minimize the matrix interference caused by CD20(+) CMFs and, then, validated for sample testing.","['Chen, Keguan', 'Page, Jerry G', 'Schwartz, Ann M', 'Lee, Thomas N', 'DeWall, Stephen L', 'Sikkema, Daniel J', 'Wang, Catherine']","['Chen K', 'Page JG', 'Schwartz AM', 'Lee TN', 'DeWall SL', 'Sikkema DJ', 'Wang C']","['Clinical Immunology, Biopharm R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, 709 Swedeland Rd., King of Prussia, PA 19406, USA.

Rare cases of atypical generalized eruptive histiocytosis have been reported in patients with hematopoietic malignancy, but the biological relationship between the two disorders is not known. We report an 84-year-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who presented with coalescing erythematous papules and plaques on the posterior neck, ear and lower lip, followed by development of blast crisis. Skin biopsy revealed a thick band-like dermal infiltrate of cells that exhibited morphologic features of macrophages or histiocytes and prominent elastolytic phagocytosis. These cells demonstrated a mature immunophenotype, expressing CD14 and CD68, with partial expression of CD13 but not CD1a, CD43, CD56, CD123, Langerin, or S-100 protein. Karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses showed loss of the Y chromosome in bone marrow and skin specimens, providing evidence of a clonal relationship between the cutaneous eruption and the underlying chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The presence of the same clone in skin and bone marrow specimens from our patient supports the possibility that atypical generalized eruptive histiocytosis is a marker for underlying hematopoietic malignancy. Discovery of additional cases may shed further light on the pathogenesis of this rare entity.","['Shon, Wonwoo', 'Peters, Margot S', 'Reed, Kurtis B', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Gibson, Lawrence E']","['Shon W', 'Peters MS', 'Reed KB', 'Ketterling RP', 'Dogan A', 'Gibson LE']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130503,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Y', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', '*Head and Neck Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'S100 Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Skin Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology']",,2013/05/04 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cup.12168 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2013 Aug;40(8):725-9. doi: 10.1111/cup.12168.

However, it is unclear if and how this benefit varies according to specific diseases. Because administration of DLI is not universally effective and could be associated with significant toxicities resulting in morbidity and mortality, it is imperative to identify cases where benefits outweigh harms of the procedure. MATERIALS & METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and extracted and pooled data independently for each disease cohort: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). RESULTS: In summary, 39 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled proportion (95% CI) for complete response was 27% (16-40) in ALL, 55% (15-92) in CLL, 26% (19-33) in MM, 52% (33-71) in NHL and 37% (20-56) in HL. CONCLUSION: Complete response rates appear higher when DLI is used for relapsed CLL and lymphomas (NHL and HL), and less pronounced in ALL or MM. Absence of data pertaining to disease-specific prognostic determinants, such as adverse genetic or molecular abnormalities, or quantitative disease burden when applicable, limit our ability to identify cases in whom benefits from DLI outweigh risks associated with the procedure within a particular disease.","['El-Jurdi, Najla', 'Reljic, Tea', 'Kumar, Ambuj', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Djulbegovic, Benjamin', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A']","['El-Jurdi N', 'Reljic T', 'Kumar A', 'Pidala J', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Djulbegovic B', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*statistics & numerical data', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/05/04 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/04 06:00'],"['2013/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/imt.13.31 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2013 May;5(5):457-66. doi: 10.2217/imt.13.31.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether there are differences in survival outcomes between the East and West, however, remain unclear. METHODS: The survival data for CLL patients identified in the Taiwan Cancer Registry database between 1990 and 2004, together with corresponding data in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, were retrieved. The relative survivals (RS, adjusted for the expected survival in the general population) were estimated in patients diagnosed in three 5-year periods of time. RESULTS: CLL drastically shortened patients' life expectancy; more importantly, this negative impact in Taiwan was much larger than that in the US: the 5-year RS in Taiwan and US were 59% and 76%, and the 10-year RS, 45% and 56%, respectively. Nevertheless, survival in Taiwan was better in the periods after 1995 (5-year RS, from 53.0% to 60.6%), a time period corresponding to the introduction of the Taiwan National Health Insurance scheme. Such improvement was largely due to decreased mortality in patients younger than 65 (5-year RS, from 53.5% to 69.1%). Despite the improvement, patients' RS in Taiwan in recent periods remain steadily 15 approximately 20% inferior to that in the US in both younger and older patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: The improved RS in Taiwan implies that therapeutic advances are changing the prognosis of CLL. The stable RS gap between Taiwanese and the US patients suggests the existence of an ethnic difference in CLL patients' outcomes.","['Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Chiang, Chun-Ju', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Lai, Mei-Shu']","['Wu SJ', 'Chiang CJ', 'Lin CT', 'Tien HF', 'Lai MS']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130424,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3634739,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0062930 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-36919 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 24;8(4):e62930. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062930.

Mixing LacZ-labeled ES cells with normal mouse mammary epithelial cells at ratios of 1:5 and 1:50 in phosphate buffered saline and immediately inoculating them into epithelium-divested mammary fat pads of immune-compromised mice accomplished this. Our results indicate that tumorigenesis occurs only when normal mammary ductal growth is not achieved in the inoculated fat pads. When normal mammary gland growth occurs, we find ES cells (LacZ+) progeny interspersed with normal mammary cell progeny in the mammary epithelial structures. We demonstrate that these progeny, marked by LacZ expression, differentiate into multiple epithelial subtypes including steroid receptor positive luminal cells and myoepithelial cells indicating that the ES cells are capable of epithelial multipotency in this context but do not form teratomas. In addition, in secondary transplants, ES cell progeny proliferate, contribute apparently normal mammary progeny, maintain their multipotency and do not produce teratomas.","['Boulanger, Corinne A', 'Bruno, Robert D', 'Mack, David L', 'Gonzales, Monica', 'Castro, Nadia P', 'Salomon, David S', 'Smith, Gilbert H']","['Boulanger CA', 'Bruno RD', 'Mack DL', 'Gonzales M', 'Castro NP', 'Salomon DS', 'Smith GH']","['Mammary Stem Cell Biology Section, Cell and Cancer Biology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130426,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', '*Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics/*pathology', '*Cellular Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics', 'Chimera', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/growth & development/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Teratoma/enzymology/pathology', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",PMC3637449,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0062019 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-35002 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 26;8(4):e62019. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062019.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study that included children and adolescents with acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed and treated at 15 Canadian centers. We evaluated infections that occurred between presentation to the healthcare system (for symptoms that led to the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia) until initiation of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among 328 children, 92 (28.0%) were neutropenic at presentation. Eleven (3.4%) had sterile-site microbiologically documented infection and four had bacteremia (only one Gram negative). Infection rate was not influenced by neutropenia. No child died from an infectious cause prior to chemotherapy initiation. CONCLUSION: It may be reasonable to withhold empiric antibiotics in febrile non-neutropenic children with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia until initiation of chemotherapy as long as they appear well without a clinical focus of infection. Future work could examine biomarkers or a clinical score to identify children presenting with leukemia and fever who are more likely to have an invasive infection.","['Portwine, Carol', 'Mitchell, David', 'Johnston, Donna', 'Gillmeister, Biljana', 'Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Yanofsky, Rochelle', 'Dix, David', 'Cellot, Sonia', 'Lewis, Victor', 'Price, Victoria', 'Silva, Mariana', 'Zelcer, Shayna', 'Bowes, Lynette', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Stobart, Kent', 'Brossard, Josee', 'Beyene, Joseph', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Portwine C', 'Mitchell D', 'Johnston D', 'Gillmeister B', 'Ethier MC', 'Yanofsky R', 'Dix D', 'Cellot S', 'Lewis V', 'Price V', 'Silva M', 'Zelcer S', 'Bowes L', 'Michon B', 'Stobart K', 'Brossard J', 'Beyene J', 'Sung L']","[""Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital at Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130426,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/*complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications']",PMC3637321,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0061899 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-36004 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 26;8(4):e61899. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061899.

For example, Notch signaling promotes T cell differentiation and is leukemogenic in T cells, whereas it inhibits early B cell differentiation and acts as a tumor suppressor in B cell leukemia where it induces growth arrest and apoptosis. The regulatory mechanisms that contribute to these opposing roles are not understood. Aberrant promoter DNA methylation and histone modifications are associated with silencing of tumor suppressor genes and have been implicated in leukemogenesis. Using methylated CpG island amplification (MCA)/DNA promoter microarray, we identified Notch3 and Hes5 as hypermethylated in human B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We investigated the methylation status of other Notch pathway genes by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Notch3, JAG1, Hes2, Hes4 and Hes5 were frequently hypermethylated in B leukemia cell lines and primary B-ALL, in contrast to T-ALL cell lines and patient samples. Aberrant methylation of Notch3 and Hes5 in B-ALL was associated with gene silencing and was accompanied by decrease of H3K4 trimethylation and H3K9 acetylation and gain of H3K9 trimethylation and H3K27 trimethylation. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment restored Hes5 expression and decreased promoter hypermethylation in most leukemia cell lines and primary B-ALL samples. Restoration of Hes5 expression by lentiviral transduction resulted in growth arrest and apoptosis in Hes5 negative B-ALL cells but not in Hes5 expressing T-ALL cells. These data suggest that epigenetic modifications are implicated in silencing of tumor suppressor of Notch/Hes pathway in B-ALL.","['Kuang, Shao-Qing', 'Fang, Zhihong', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A', 'Yang, Hui', 'Wei, Yue', 'Gonzalez-Cervantes, Emilio A', 'Boumber, Yanis', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Kuang SQ', 'Fang Z', 'Zweidler-McKay PA', 'Yang H', 'Wei Y', 'Gonzalez-Cervantes EA', 'Boumber Y', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130426,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Decitabine', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Vorinostat']",PMC3637323,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0061807 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-23380 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 26;8(4):e61807. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061807.

Our goal was to develop cell-penetrating fusion peptides specifically designed to disrupt the caspase-9/PP2A interaction and evaluate their therapeutic potential in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a peptide containing a penetrating sequence associated to the interaction motif between human caspase-9 and PP2A (DPT-C9h), in order to target their association. Using tumour cell lines, primary human cells and primary human breast cancer (BC) xenografts, we investigated the capacity of DPT-C9h to provoke apoptosis in vitro and inhibition of tumour growth (TGI) in vivo. DPT-C9h was intraperitoneally administered at doses from 1 to 25 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks. Relative Tumour Volume (RTV) was calculated. RESULTS: We demonstrated that DPT-C9h specifically target caspase-9/PP2A interaction in vitro and in vivo and induced caspase-9-dependent apoptosis in cancer cell lines. DPT-C9h also induced significant TGI in BC xenografts models. The mouse-specific peptide DPT-C9 also induced TGI in lung (K-Ras model) and breast cancer (PyMT) models. DPT-C9h has a specific effect on transformed B cells isolated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients without any effect on primary healthy cells. Finally, neither toxicity nor immunogenic responses were observed. CONCLUSION: Using the cell-penetrating peptides blocking caspase-9/PP2A interactions, we have demonstrated that DPT-C9h had a strong therapeutic effect in vitro and in vivo in mouse models of tumour progression.","['Arrouss, Issam', 'Nemati, Fariba', 'Roncal, Fernando', 'Wislez, Marie', 'Dorgham, Karim', 'Vallerand, David', 'Rabbe, Nathalie', 'Karboul, Narjesse', 'Carlotti, Francoise', 'Bravo, Jeronimo', 'Mazier, Dominique', 'Decaudin, Didier', 'Rebollo, Angelita']","['Arrouss I', 'Nemati F', 'Roncal F', 'Wislez M', 'Dorgham K', 'Vallerand D', 'Rabbe N', 'Karboul N', 'Carlotti F', 'Bravo J', 'Mazier D', 'Decaudin D', 'Rebollo A']","['Inserm UMRS 945, Hopital Pitie Salpetriere, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130423,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Caspase 9/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', '*Drug Design', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3634037,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060816 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-36875 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 23;8(4):e60816. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060816.

Since other human-pathogenic retroviruses, such as HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and -II, are known blood-transmitted pathogens, XMRV might present another hazard associated with products derived from in vitro cultures of human or animal origin, or blood component-based therapeutics. Here, we investigated whether XMRV was transmitted to individuals with hemophilia and frequent exposure to plasma-derived or recombinant clotting factors. METHODS: We used highly sensitive real-time PCR to test plasma samples from 127 consecutive individuals with hemophilia who consulted our hemophilia center either for treatment or for a standard check-up. RESULTS: From the 127 hemophiliacs, 80 had prior contact to persons with either hepatitis B (n = 30), hepatitis C (n = 74) and/or HIV (n = 21), and 30 were currently being treated with plasma-derived and 97 with recombinant factor concentrates. None of the individuals tested positive for XMRV. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of the ongoing discussion on whether the positive XMRV testing in initial reports was a result of reagent, sample, or tissue contamination, and whether XMRV is a real threat or a testing artifact, our data suggest that XMRV might not play an important role for hemophiliacs.","['Schuttrumpf, Jorg', 'Hourfar, M Kai', 'Alesci, Sonja', 'Miesbach, Wolfgang', 'Seifried, Erhard', 'Schmidt, Michael']","['Schuttrumpf J', 'Hourfar MK', 'Alesci S', 'Miesbach W', 'Seifried E', 'Schmidt M']","['Institut fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie, Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitat, DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Wurttemberg - Hessen, Frankfurt/M., Germany ; Chemotherapeutisches Forschungsinstitut Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt/M., Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130103,Switzerland,Transfus Med Hemother,Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,101176417,,,PMC3636008,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/05/03 06:01,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000345661 [doi]', 'tmh-0040-0032 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfus Med Hemother. 2013 Feb;40(1):32-5. doi: 10.1159/000345661.

The recent finding of gene fusions in prostate and lung cancers has motivated the search for pathogenic gene fusions in other malignancies. Here, we developed a ""breakpoint analysis"" pipeline to discover candidate gene fusions by tell-tale transcript level or genomic DNA copy number transitions occurring within genes. Mining data from 974 diverse cancer samples, we identified 198 candidate fusions involving annotated cancer genes. From these, we validated and further characterized novel gene fusions involving ROS1 tyrosine kinase in angiosarcoma (CEP85L/ROS1), SLC1A2 glutamate transporter in colon cancer (APIP/SLC1A2), RAF1 kinase in pancreatic cancer (ATG7/RAF1) and anaplastic astrocytoma (BCL6/RAF1), EWSR1 in melanoma (EWSR1/CREM), CDK6 kinase in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (FAM133B/CDK6), and CLTC in breast cancer (CLTC/VMP1). Notably, while these fusions involved known cancer genes, all occurred with novel fusion partners and in previously unreported cancer types. Moreover, several constituted druggable targets (including kinases), with therapeutic implications for their respective malignancies. Lastly, breakpoint analysis identified new cell line models for known rearrangements, including EGFRvIII and FIP1L1/PDGFRA. Taken together, we provide a robust approach for gene fusion discovery, and our results highlight a more widespread role of fusion genes in cancer pathogenesis.","['Giacomini, Craig P', 'Sun, Steven', 'Varma, Sushama', 'Shain, A Hunter', 'Giacomini, Marilyn M', 'Balagtas, Jay', 'Sweeney, Robert T', 'Lai, Everett', 'Del Vecchio, Catherine A', 'Forster, Andrew D', 'Clarke, Nicole', 'Montgomery, Kelli D', 'Zhu, Shirley', 'Wong, Albert J', 'van de Rijn, Matt', 'West, Robert B', 'Pollack, Jonathan R']","['Giacomini CP', 'Sun S', 'Varma S', 'Shain AH', 'Giacomini MM', 'Balagtas J', 'Sweeney RT', 'Lai E', 'Del Vecchio CA', 'Forster AD', 'Clarke N', 'Montgomery KD', 'Zhu S', 'Wong AJ', 'van de Rijn M', 'West RB', 'Pollack JR']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130425,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,IM,"['*Gene Fusion', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",PMC3636093,2013/05/03 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1003464 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-12-02993 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2013 Apr;9(4):e1003464. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003464.

The TRIM5alpha RING domain exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and assists the higher-order association of TRIM5alpha dimers, which promotes capsid binding. We characterized a panel of RING domain mutants of the rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha (TRIM5alpha(rh)) protein. The RING domain function that significantly contributed to retroviral restriction depended upon the restricted virus. The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING domain contributes to the potency of HIV-1 restriction. Nonetheless, TRIM5alpha(rh) mutants without detectable E3 ubiquitin ligase activity still blocked reverse transcription and inhibited HIV-1 infection at a moderate level. When TRIM5alpha(rh) capsid binding was weakened by substitution with a less efficient B30.2/SPRY domain, the promotion of higher-order association by the RING domain was more important to HIV-1 restriction than its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. For the restriction of N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) infection, promotion of higher-order association represented the major contribution of the RING domain. Thus, both identity of the target virus and the B30.2/SPRY domain-mediated affinity for the viral capsid determine the relative contribution of the two known RING domain functions to TRIM5alpha restriction of retrovirus infection.","['Li, Xing', 'Kim, Jonghwa', 'Song, Byeongwoon', 'Finzi, Andres', 'Pacheco, Beatriz', 'Sodroski, Joseph']","['Li X', 'Kim J', 'Song B', 'Finzi A', 'Pacheco B', 'Sodroski J']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130501,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', '*HIV-1', 'Humans', '*Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",PMC3700309,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00620-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00620-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jul;87(13):7234-45. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00620-13.

Here we show that the transcription factor (TF) stem cell leukaemia (Scl/Tal1) is crucial for development of these adult haemangioblasts in Xenopus and establish the regulatory cascade controlling its expression. We show that VEGFA produced in the somites is required to initiate adult haemangioblast programming in the adjacent DLP by establishing endogenous VEGFA signalling. This response depends on expression of the VEGF receptor Flk1, driven by Fli1 and Gata2. Scl activation requires synergy between this VEGFA-controlled pathway and a VEGFA-independent pathway controlled by Fli1, Gata2 and Etv2/Etsrp/ER71, which also drives expression of the Scl partner Lmo2. Thus, the two ETS factors Fli1 and Etv6, which drives the VEGFA expression in both somites and the DLP, sit at the top of the adult haemangioblast gene regulatory network (GRN). Furthermore, Gata2 is initially activated by Fli1 but later maintained by another ETS factor, Etv2. We also establish that Flk1 and Etv2 act independently in the two pathways to Scl activation. Thus, detailed temporal, epistatic measurements of key TFs and VEGFA plus its receptor have enabled us to build a Xenopus adult haemangioblast GRN.","['Ciau-Uitz, Aldo', 'Pinheiro, Philip', 'Kirmizitas, Arif', 'Zuo, Jie', 'Patient, Roger']","['Ciau-Uitz A', 'Pinheiro P', 'Kirmizitas A', 'Zuo J', 'Patient R']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130501,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/drug effects/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hemangioblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Morpholinos/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somites/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenopus Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenopus laevis/blood/*metabolism']",PMC3666388,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.090829 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.090829 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2013 Jun;140(12):2632-42. doi: 10.1242/dev.090829.

In spite of attenuated signaling properties, defective K-Ras oncoproteins initiated aggressive clonal T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Murine T-ALLs expressing second site mutant proteins restored full oncogenic Ras activity through diverse mechanisms, which included acquiring novel somatic third site Kras(D12) mutations and silencing PTEN. T-ALL cell lines lacking PTEN had elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt, a gene expression pattern similar to human early T-cell precursor ALL, and were resistant to the potent and selective MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Our data, which demonstrate strong selective pressure to overcome the defective activation of PI3 kinase/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK, implicate both Ras effector pathways as drivers of aberrant growth in T-ALL and further suggest that leukemia cells will deploy multiple mechanisms to develop resistance to targeted inhibitors in vivo.","['Shieh, Angell', 'Ward, Ashley F', 'Donlan, Kegan L', 'Harding-Theobald, Emily R', 'Xu, Jin', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Chen, Shann-Ching', 'Su, Xiaoping', 'Downing, James R', 'Bollag, Gideon E', 'Shannon, Kevin M']","['Shieh A', 'Ward AF', 'Donlan KL', 'Harding-Theobald ER', 'Xu J', 'Mullighan CG', 'Zhang C', 'Chen SC', 'Su X', 'Downing JR', 'Bollag GE', 'Shannon KM']","['Department of Pediatrics and Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, University of California-San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130501,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/genetics/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'raf Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3682340,2013/05/03 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57283-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-432252 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 13;121(24):4884-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-432252.

Investigation for additional abnormalities associated with a well-recognized subtype, core-binding factor AML (CBF-AML) can provide further understanding and discrimination to this special group of leukemia. In order to better define genetic alterations in CBF-AML and identify possible cooperating lesions, a single-nucleotide polymorphism-array (SNP-array) analysis was performed, combined to KIT mutation screening, in a set of cases. Validation of SNP-array results was done by array comparative genomic hybridization and FISH. Fifteen cases were analyzed. Three cases had microscopic lesions better delineated by arrays. One case had +22 not identified by arrays. Submicroscopic abnormalities were mostly non-recurrent between samples. Of relevance, four regions were more frequently affected: 4q28, 9p11, 16q22.1, and 16q23. One case had an uncovered unbalanced inv(16) due to submicroscopic deletion of 5 MYH11 and 3 CBFB.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether LIF can protect PC12 cells from antimycin A (AMA)-induced oxidative stress. LIF (0.5 and 1 ng/ml) increased PC12 cell viability and significantly attenuated AMA-induced cell death as demonstrated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Results from Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry assay showed that AMA induced apoptosis significantly in PC12 cells, while pretreatment with LIF (0.5 and 1 ng/ml) can attenuate this injury. The presence of LIF partly prevented AMA-induced elevated reactive oxygen species level and decreased superoxide dismutase level, which indicated the antioxidative effects of LIF on the neuron oxidative injury. In conclusion, LIF might protect PC12 cells from the injury induced by AMA through the downregulation of oxidative stress, which may provide basic information of using LIF as a potential targeted therapy for oxidative injury in neurons.","['Han, Yangguang', 'Xu, Jing', 'Li, Zhigui', 'Yang, Zhuo']","['Han Y', 'Xu J', 'Li Z', 'Yang Z']","['College of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130501,United States,J Mol Neurosci,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimycin A/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/drug effects', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'PC12 Cells', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",,2013/05/03 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12031-013-0004-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Neurosci. 2013 Jul;50(3):577-85. doi: 10.1007/s12031-013-0004-x.

Propolis (bee glue) is a material collected from various plants by honeybees and is a rich source of bioactive compounds, including the natural flavonoid chrysin, which possesses multiple anticancer effects. We investigated the mechanism underlying the TRAIL sensitization effect of chrysin, which is a major constituent of Thai propolis, in human lung and cervical cancer cell lines. Propolis extract and chrysin sensitizes A549 and HeLa human cancer cell lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The TRAIL sensitization effect of chrysin is not mediated by inhibition of TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB activation or by glutathione depletion. Immunoblot analysis using a panel of anti-apoptotic proteins revealed that chrysin selectively decreases the levels of Mcl-1 protein, by downregulating Mcl-1 gene expression as determined by qRT-PCR. The contribution of Mcl-1 in TRAIL resistance was confirmed by si-Mcl-1 knockdown. Among signaling pathways that regulate Mcl-1 gene expression, only constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation was suppressed by chrysin. The proposed action of chrysin in TRAIL sensitization by inhibiting STAT3 and downregulating Mcl-1 was supported by using a STAT3specific inhibitor, cucurbitacin-I, which decreased Mcl-1 levels and enhanced TRAIL-induced cell death, similar to that observed with chrysin treatment. In conclusion, we show the potential of chrysin in overcoming TRAIL resistance of cancer cells and elucidate its mechanism of action.","['Lirdprapamongkol, Kriengsak', 'Sakurai, Hiroaki', 'Abdelhamed, Sherif', 'Yokoyama, Satoru', 'Athikomkulchai, Sirivan', 'Viriyaroj, Amornrat', 'Awale, Suresh', 'Ruchirawat, Somsak', 'Svasti, Jisnuson', 'Saiki, Ikuo']","['Lirdprapamongkol K', 'Sakurai H', 'Abdelhamed S', 'Yokoyama S', 'Athikomkulchai S', 'Viriyaroj A', 'Awale S', 'Ruchirawat S', 'Svasti J', 'Saiki I']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok 10210, Thailand. kriengsak@cri.or.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130501,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Female', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Propolis/administration & dosage', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology']",,2013/05/03 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.1926 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2013 Jul;43(1):329-37. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.1926.

Unfortunately, except in patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, responses to DLI have been disappointing. GVL induction is likely to be most effective in the setting of minimal residual disease. Prevention of relapse through the provision of prophylactic DLI to high-risk patients may improve the outcome of allogeneic HSCT. We previously reported that ex vivo costimulated T cell infusion of activated DLI (aDLI) as treatment for relapse is safe and has potent GVL effects. We hypothesized that prophylactic aDLI can be given safely and prevent relapse in high-risk patients after allogeneic HSCT. Eighteen patients with acute myeolgenous leukemia (n = 14), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1) underwent allogeneic HSCT after a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen with alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and busulfan. Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate with a planned early and rapid taper of tacrolimus. Patients without GVHD, off immune suppression, and in remission received aDLI at a dose of 1 x 10(7) CD3(+) cells/kg (aDLI 1) at day +120, followed by a second infusion of 1 x 10(8) CD3 cells/kg (aDLI 2) at day +180. At a median follow-up of 58 months, 5 of the 18 patients (28%) were alive, and 4 patients were in remission. Eleven patients (65%) relapsed, at a median time of 191 days. Twelve of the 18 patients received at least one aDLI, and 6 of these 12 patients also received aDLI 2. Six patients did not receive any aDLI owing to early relapse (n = 2), protocol ineligibility (n = 1), or GVHD (n = 3). Only 2 of the 12 patients who received aDLI 1 developed GVHD. Two out of the 12 patients remain in remission at the time of this report. Disease recurrence was the cause of death in 10 of the 13 patients (77%) who died.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance and differentiation of HSCs have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that zebrafish Ddx46, encoding a DEAD-box RNA helicase, is expressed in HSCs of the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT). The number of HSCs expressing the molecular markers cmyb or T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (tal1) was markedly reduced in Ddx46 mutants. However, massive cell death of HSCs was not detected, and proliferation of HSCs was normal in the CHT of the mutants at 48 h postfertilization. We found that myelopoiesis occurred, but erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis were suppressed, in Ddx46 mutants. Consistent with these results, the expression of spi1, encoding a regulator of myeloid development, was maintained, but the expression of gata1a, encoding a regulator of erythrocyte development, was downregulated in the mutants. Taken together, our results provide the first genetic evidence that zebrafish Ddx46 is required for the multilineage differentiation of HSCs during development, through the regulation of specific gene expressions.","['Hirabayashi, Ryo', 'Hozumi, Shunya', 'Higashijima, Shin-Ichi', 'Kikuchi, Yutaka']","['Hirabayashi R', 'Hozumi S', 'Higashijima S', 'Kikuchi Y']","['Department of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130608,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis', 'Zebrafish/genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3760052,2013/05/03 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2012.0623 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Sep 15;22(18):2532-42. doi: 10.1089/scd.2012.0623.

The relationships between patterns of mutations and epigenetic phenotypes are not yet clear. METHODS: We analyzed the genomes of 200 clinically annotated adult cases of de novo AML, using either whole-genome sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150 cases), along with RNA and microRNA sequencing and DNA-methylation analysis. RESULTS: AML genomes have fewer mutations than most other adult cancers, with an average of only 13 mutations found in genes. Of these, an average of 5 are in genes that are recurrently mutated in AML. A total of 23 genes were significantly mutated, and another 237 were mutated in two or more samples. Nearly all samples had at least 1 nonsynonymous mutation in one of nine categories of genes that are almost certainly relevant for pathogenesis, including transcription-factor fusions (18% of cases), the gene encoding nucleophosmin (NPM1) (27%), tumor-suppressor genes (16%), DNA-methylation-related genes (44%), signaling genes (59%), chromatin-modifying genes (30%), myeloid transcription-factor genes (22%), cohesin-complex genes (13%), and spliceosome-complex genes (14%). Patterns of cooperation and mutual exclusivity suggested strong biologic relationships among several of the genes and categories. CONCLUSIONS: We identified at least one potential driver mutation in nearly all AML samples and found that a complex interplay of genetic events contributes to AML pathogenesis in individual patients. The databases from this study are widely available to serve as a foundation for further investigations of AML pathogenesis, classification, and risk stratification.

AIM: The present study was undertaken to calculate the prevalence of various conditions associated with thrombocytopenia and to record the megakaryocytic alterations in various cases of thrombocytopenia. Apart from this by means of statistical analysis it was tried to analyze whether a significant difference existed in megakaryocytic alteration noted in myelodysplastic versus non- myelodysplastic conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective series of 60 bone marrow aspirations along with concomitant bone marrow biopsies was conducted in a tertiary care centre catering to both urban as well as rural population in north India. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The distribution of morphological changes in cases of non myelodysplastic conditions and myelodysplastic were compared using Chi-Square test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The commonest cause of thrombocytopenia for which bone marrow examination was sought was dimorphic anaemia (18 cases, 30%), followed by myelodysplastic syndrome (06 cases, 10%) which was followed equally by acute lymphocytic leukemia and blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Of all the non-MDS conditions apart from dimorphic anaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and chronic myeloid leukemia (blast crisis); megakaryocytic dysplastic forms were not noted in any other condition. In cases of myelodysplasia; dysplastic forms, bare megakaryocytic nuclei, hypogranular forms and micromegakaryocytes were seen. Comparison between frequencies of normal, high and low number of nuclear lobes among MDS (n=9) and non MDS (n=68) conditions were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Further studies on the evaluation of megakaryocytic alteration and their contribution to thrombocytopenia can provide growing knowledge to the pathogenesis of numerous hematopoietic disorders that may identify broader clinical applications of the newer strategies to regulate platelet count and functioning.","['Bhasin, Tejinder Singh', 'Sharma, Sonam', 'Manjari, Mridu', 'Mannan, Rahul', 'Kansal, Vandana', 'Chandey, Manish', 'Piplani, Sanjay']","['Bhasin TS', 'Sharma S', 'Manjari M', 'Mannan R', 'Kansal V', 'Chandey M', 'Piplani S']","['Associate Professor, Department of Pathology, Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research , Amritsar, Punjab, India .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130124,India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,,PMC3616559,2013/05/02 06:00,2013/05/02 06:01,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2013/5085.2801 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2013 Mar;7(3):473-9. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5085.2801.

We assessed prognostic significance of European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2006- and 2009-defined responses and the prognostic value of molecular responses at defined time points on 5-year survivals. Among the cumulative rates of incidence of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses and all important survival parameters, we evaluated the prognostic significance of different BCR-ABL transcript-level ratios (</=1%; >1%-</=10%; >10%) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (n = 199). The ELN optimal response criteria and their predictive role were significantly beneficial for event-free survival at all given time points.

Significantly better outcome was found in patients who achieved major molecular response (MMR) in the 12th month. The cumulative incidences of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and MMR were significantly associated with the molecular response in the 3rd month. The ELN response criteria and their predictive role were helpful at given time points; however, the 2009 definition did not significantly alter the prognostic accuracy compared with that of the 2006 definition. The significant value was observed for cytogenetic responses at the 6th and 12th month. Moreover, progression-free and event-free survivals were improved with MMR at the 12th month.","['Klamova, Hana', 'Polakova, Katerina Machova', 'Muzik, Jan', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Zackova, Daniela', 'Steinerova, Katerina', 'Karas, Michal', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Demeckova, Eva', 'Michalovicova-Sninska, Zuzana', 'Voglova, Jaroslava', 'Demitrovicova, Ludmila', 'Mikuskova, Eva', 'Tothova, Elena', 'Chudej, Juraj', 'Markuljak, Imrich', 'Cmunt, Eduard', 'Moravcova, Jana', 'Dvorakova, Dana', 'Michalova, Kyra', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Stastna, Marketa Markova', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Dusek, Ladislav', 'Koza, Vladimir', 'Trneny, Marek', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Klamova H', 'Polakova KM', 'Muzik J', 'Racil Z', 'Zackova D', 'Steinerova K', 'Karas M', 'Faber E', 'Demeckova E', 'Michalovicova-Sninska Z', 'Voglova J', 'Demitrovicova L', 'Mikuskova E', 'Tothova E', 'Chudej J', 'Markuljak I', 'Cmunt E', 'Moravcova J', 'Dvorakova D', 'Michalova K', 'Jarosova M', 'Stastna MM', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Dusek L', 'Koza V', 'Trneny M', 'Indrak K']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion Prague, Czech Republic. hana.klamova@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130221,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3639660,2013/05/02 06:00,2013/05/02 06:01,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.59 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2013 Apr;2(2):216-25. doi: 10.1002/cam4.59.

Of the different members in the BCL-2 family, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) is commonly amplified in human tumors and is associated with their relapse and chemoresistance. As a result, specific inhibitors of MCL-1 are being designed to treat resistant tumors. However, there is increasing evidence for other nonapoptotic roles of the BCL-2 family, ranging from ionic homeostasis and autophagy to the regulation of fission-fusion dynamics in subcellular organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In this study, we characterize the specificity of two novel putative MCL-1 inhibitors, BI97C1 (Sabutoclax) and BI112D1, in inducing apoptosis in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner and in an MCL-1-dependent system. In addition to their being proapoptotic, these inhibitors also cause enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation that accompanies a time-dependent loss of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), suggesting an impairment of mitochondrial fusion. This mitochondrial fragmentation occurs independently of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-mediated fission activity and, unlike most apoptotic stimuli, occurs upstream of and/or independent of BAX, BAK, and other BH3-only proteins. Furthermore, this mitochondrial fragmentation occurred rapidly and preceded other hallmarks of apoptosis, including the loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c. Although such mitochondrial fragmentation did not deplete total cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or alter other mitochondrial complexes, there was significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species.","['Varadarajan, Shankar', 'Butterworth, Michael', 'Wei, Jun', 'Pellecchia, Maurizio', 'Dinsdale, David', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['Varadarajan S', 'Butterworth M', 'Wei J', 'Pellecchia M', 'Dinsdale D', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dynamins', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Dynamics/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",PMC3638359,2013/05/02 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.13230 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2013 May;15(5):568-78. doi: 10.1593/neo.13230.,5,,"['0', ""(1,1',6,6',7,7'-hexahydroxy-3,3'-dimethyl-N5-(2-phenylpropyl)-N5'-(2-phenylpropyl"", "")-2,2'-binaphthyl-5,5'-dicarboxamide)"", '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BI112D1)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (OPA1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (DNM1L protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamins)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",,,"['MC_U132615750/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA149668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '149668/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY ANSWER: Multicolor flow cytometry (FCM) is useful to evaluate the presence of viable leukemic cells in the ovarian cortex with a high specificity and a robust sensitivity. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Storing ovarian tissue is an option to preserve fertility before gonadotoxic radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatments. However, transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian cortex to women cured of leukemia is currently not possible due to the risk of cancer re-seeding. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We developed an automated ovarian cortex dissociation technique and we used eight-color FCM to identify leukemic cells with a series of dilutions added to ovarian single cell suspensions obtained from healthy cortex. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: Healthy ovarian cortex originated from women between 23 and 39 years of age undergoing laparoscopic ovarian drilling for polycystic ovary syndrome. Blood or bone marrow cells were collected in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients at diagnosis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The tissue dissociation technique yield was 1.83 +/- 1.49 x 10(6) viable nucleated cells per 100 mg of ovarian cortex. No cell exhibiting a leukemic phenotype was present in the normal ovarian cortex. Added leukemic cells were detected using their leukemia-associated phenotype up to a dilution of 10(-4). When specific gene rearrangements were present, they were detected by real-time quantitative PCR at the same dilution. The ovarian cortex from two leukemia patients was then used, respectively, as positive and negative controls. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Making available minimal residual disease (MRD) detection techniques (multicolor FCM, PCR and xenograft), that can be used either alone or together, is essential to add a fail-safe oncological dimension to pre-autograft monitoring. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This approach can be performed on fresh ovarian tissue during cryopreservation or on frozen/thawed tissue before reimplantation and it is currently the only available technique in cases of ALL where no molecular markers are identified. This new perspective should lead to studies on ovarian tissue from leukemia patients, for whom the presence of MRD should be established before autograft.

In recent years, our knowledge of the molecular genetics of chronic lymphocytic leukemia has significantly broadened, offering potential new clinical implications. Mutations of TP53 and ATM add prognostic information independently of fluorescence in situ hybridization cytogenetic stratification. In addition, next generation sequencing technologies have allowed previously unknown genomic alterations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia to be identified. Mutations of NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 have been associated with short time to progression and survival. Each of these lesions recognizes a different distribution across different clinical phases and biological subgroups of the disease. The clinical implications of these molecular lesions are in some instances well established, such as in the case of patients with TP53 disruption, who should be considered for alternative therapies/allogeneic stem cell transplant upfront, or in patients with ATM disruption, who are candidates to rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. On the contrary, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 mutations appear to have a specific significance, the clinical value of which is currently being validated, i.e. association to Richter syndrome transformation for NOTCH1 mutations, and short progression-free survival after treatment for SF3B1 mutations. Certainly, these new lesions have helped clarify the molecular bases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia aggressiveness beside TP53 disruption. This review covers the recent advancements in our understanding of the molecular genetics of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and discusses how they are going to translate into clinical implications for patient management.","['Foa, Robin', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Foa R', 'Del Giudice I', 'Guarini A', 'Rossi D', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University Sapienza, Rome, Italy. rfoa@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis']",PMC3640109,2013/05/02 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.069369 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.069369 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 May;98(5):675-85. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.069369.,5,,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2013 Sep;98(9):e115-6.

The leukemic cells in Tg mice expressing Tax show p53 dysfunction and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, similar to that seen in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells from patients infected with HTLV-1. However, it is unclear when these effects occur in HTLV-1 carriers during the development of ATLL. Here, we examined p53 function and NF-kappaB activity before the onset of leukemia in Tax-expressing Tg (Tax-Tg) mice between 4 and 25 months of age. At 4-10 months of age, 71% of mice showed p53 inactivation, without evidence for NF-kappaB activation, even though tax expression was consistent from 4 to 25 months of age. The decline in p53 function resulted from decreased p53 accumulation after DNA damage. From 11 months of age onward, 75% of mice showed p53 dysfunction and 37.5% showed constitutive NF-kappaB activation with the components of p50 and RelB. An NF-kappaB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), reduced NF-kappaB activity (i.e. p50/RelB) but did not restore p53 function. In vivo, treatment with DHMEQ until 24 months of age prevented the onset of T-cell leukemia in Tax-Tg mice. These results suggest that the Tax-induced decline in p53 function, which is independent of NF-kappaB activation in the early stage, might be the first stage in the onset of ATLL. NF-kappaB activity is involved in the later stages of ATLL onset.","['Ohsugi, Takeo', 'Ishida, Takaomi', 'Shimasaki, Tatsuya', 'Okada, Seiji', 'Umezawa, Kazuo']","['Ohsugi T', 'Ishida T', 'Shimasaki T', 'Okada S', 'Umezawa K']","['Division of Microbiology and Genetics, Institute of Resource Development and Analysis, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130430,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/05/02 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bgt144 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgt144 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Sep;34(9):2129-36. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgt144.

Opioid receptor stimulation can activate inhibitory Gi-proteins which in turn block adenylyl cyclase activity reducing cAMP. Opioids such as D,L-methadone induce cell death in leukemia cells. However, the mechanism how opioids trigger apoptosis and activate caspases in leukemia cells is not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that downregulation of cAMP induced by opioid receptor activation using the opioid D,L-methadone kills and sensitizes leukemia cells for doxorubicin treatment. Enhancing cAMP levels by blocking opioid-receptor signaling strongly reduced D,L-methadone-induced apoptosis, caspase activation and doxorubicin-sensitivity. Induction of cell death in leukemia cells by activation of opioid receptors using the opioid D,L-methadone depends on critical levels of opioid receptor expression on the cell surface. Doxorubicin increased opioid receptor expression in leukemia cells. In addition, the opioid D,L-methadone increased doxorubicin uptake and decreased doxorubicin efflux in leukemia cells, suggesting that the opioid D,L-methadone as well as doxorubicin mutually increase their cytotoxic potential. Furthermore, we found that opioid receptor activation using D,L-methadone alone or in addition to doxorubicin inhibits tumor growth significantly in vivo. These results demonstrate that opioid receptor activation via triggering the downregulation of cAMP induces apoptosis, activates caspases and sensitizes leukemia cells for doxorubicin treatment. Hence, opioid receptor activation seems to be a promising strategy to improve anticancer therapies.","['Friesen, Claudia', 'Roscher, Mareike', 'Hormann, Inis', 'Fichtner, Iduna', 'Alt, Andreas', 'Hilger, Ralf A', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Miltner, Erich']","['Friesen C', 'Roscher M', 'Hormann I', 'Fichtner I', 'Alt A', 'Hilger RA', 'Debatin KM', 'Miltner E']","['Center for Biomedical Research, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. claudia.friesen@uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism', 'Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/blood/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methadone/blood/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Opioid/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC3742829,2013/05/02 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['952 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.952 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2013 May;4(5):677-90. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.952.,5,,"['0 (Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors)', '0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Receptors, Opioid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'UC6VBE7V1Z (Methadone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently available inhibitors do not target all BCL2 family prosurvival proteins and their effectiveness is also modified by proapoptotic BCL2 homology domain 3 (BH3) only protein expression. The goal of this study was to evaluate synergy between the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction inhibitor, 4EGI-1, and the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CLL cells were cultured in conditions to mimic the lymph node microenvironment. Protein synthesis and cap-complex formation were determined. Polysome association of mRNAs from BCL2 family survival genes was analyzed by translational profiling. The effects of 4EGI-1 and the BCL2/BCL2L1 antagonist, ABT-737, on CLL cell apoptosis were determined. RESULTS: Protein synthesis was increased approximately 6-fold by stromal cell/CD154 culture in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase alpha (PI3Kalpha)-specific manner and was reduced by 4EGI-1. PI3K inhibitors and 4EGI-1 also reduced cap-complex formation but only 4EGI-1 consistently reduced BCL2L1 and BCL2A1 protein levels. 4EGI-1, but not PI3K inhibitors or rapamycin, induced an endoplasmic reticulum stress response including proapoptotic NOXA and the translation inhibitor phosphorylated eIF2alpha. 4EGI-1 and ABT-737 synergized to cause apoptosis, independent of levels of prosurvival protein expression in individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall protein synthesis and cap-complex formation are induced by microenvironment stimuli in CLL. Inhibition of the cap-complex was not sufficient to repress BCL2 family prosurvival expression, but 4EGI-1 inhibited BCL2A1 and BCL2L1 while inducing NOXA through cap-dependent and -independent mechanisms. 4EGI-1 and ABT-737 synergized to produce apoptosis, and these agents may be the basis for a therapeutically useful combination.","['Willimott, Shaun', 'Beck, Daniel', 'Ahearne, Matthew J', 'Adams, Victoria C', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Willimott S', 'Beck D', 'Ahearne MJ', 'Adams VC', 'Wagner SD']","['Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine and MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130430,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Elafin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitro Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",,2013/05/02 06:00,2014/02/14 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2185 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2185 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 15;19(12):3212-23. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2185.

Overall 5-year survival remains poor in older AML patients; it is <5% in patients aged >65 years. In this study, the authors examined whether survival has improved for subsets of geriatric AML patients over 3 successive decades. METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data were used to determine trends in relative survival by age among 19,000 patients with AML over 3 successive decades (1977-1986, 1987-1996, and 1997-2006). Relative survival rates (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as measures of survival. RESULTS: Overall, the RRs increased for each successive decade (1977-1986, 1987-1996, and 1997-2006) in patients ages 65 to 74 years, with improvements in 12-month survival from 20%, to 25%, to 30%, respectively. Findings were similar for 24-month, 36-month, 48-month, and 60-month survival. However, survival rates did not improve in patients aged >/=75 years. The oldest old patients (aged >/=85 years) had the lowest survival rates, with no apparent improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of a large data set demonstrated that, although overall survival remained unsatisfactory among older patients, it improved in the younger old (ages 65-74 years). Survival of older old AML patients has not been favorably impacted by available AML therapies or supportive care, and intervention in this age group is best undertaken on a clinical trial.","['Thein, Mya S', 'Ershler, William B', 'Jemal, Ahmedin', 'Yates, Jerome W', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Thein MS', 'Ershler WB', 'Jemal A', 'Yates JW', 'Baer MR']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130430,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3821042,2013/05/02 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28129 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Aug 1;119(15):2720-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28129.

This is influenced by the negative effects of disease and treatment of childhood cancer and by behavioural and social elements. Exercise training for adults during or after cancer therapy has frequently been reported to improve physical fitness and social functioning. More recently, literature on this subject became available for children and young adults with cancer, both during and after treatment. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to evaluate the effect of a physical exercise training intervention (at home, at a physical therapy centre, or hospital based) on the physical fitness of children with cancer, in comparison with the physical fitness in a care as usual control group. The intervention needed to be offered within the first five years from diagnosis.The second aim was to assess the effects of a physical exercise training intervention in this population on fatigue, anxiety, depression, self efficacy, and health-related quality of life and to assess the adverse effects of the intervention. SEARCH METHODS: For this review the electronic databases of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, and ongoing trial registries were searched on 6 September 2011. In addition, a handsearch of reference lists and conference proceedings was performed in that same month. SELECTION CRITERIA: The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that compared the effects of physical exercise training with no training, in people who were within the first five years of their diagnosis of childhood cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: By the use of standardised forms two review authors independently identified studies meeting the inclusion criteria, performed the data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias. Quality of the studies was rated by using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Five articles were included in this review: four RCTs (14, 14, 28, and 51 participants) and one CCT (24 participants). In total 131 participants (74 boys, 54 girls, three unknown) were included in the analysis, all being treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The study interventions were all implemented during chemotherapy treatment.The duration of the training sessions ranged from 15 to 60 minutes per session. Both the type of intervention, as well as the intervention period, which ranged from 10 weeks to two years, varied in all the included studies. In all included studies the control group received care as usual.All studies had methodological limitations, such as small numbers of participants, unclear randomisation methods, and single-blind study designs in case of an RCT.Cardiorespiratory fitness was studied by the use of the nine-minute run-walk test, the timed up-and-down stairs test, and the 20-m shuttle run test. Only the up-and-down stairs test showed significant differences between the intervention and the control group, in favour of the intervention group (P value = 0.05, no further information available).Bone mineral density was assessed in one study, in which a statistically significant difference in favour of the exercise group was identified (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 1.66; P value < 0.001). Body mass index was assessed in two studies. The pooled data on this item did not show a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control study group.Flexibility was assessed in three studies. In one study the active ankle dorsiflexion method was used to assess flexibility and the second study they used the passive ankle dorsiflexion test. No statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group was identified with the active ankle dorsiflexion test, whereas with the passive test method a statistically significant difference in favour of the exercise group was found (SMD 0.69; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.25; P value = 0.02). The third study assessed body flexibility by the use of the sit-and-reach distance test; no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group was identified.One study assessed the effects of an inspiratory muscle training programme aimed to train the lung muscles and increase physical fitness. This study reported no significant effect on either inspiratory or expiratory muscle strength. Two other studies using either knee and ankle strength changes by hand-held dynamometry or the number of completed push-ups (with knees on the ground) and a peripheral quantitative computed tomography of the tibia to determine the muscle mass did not identify statistically significant differences in muscle strength/endurance.The level of daily activity, health-related quality of life, fatigue, and adverse events were assessed in one study only; for all these items no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group were found.None of the included studies evaluated the outcomes activity energy expenditure, time spent exercising, anxiety and depression, or self efficacy. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effects of physical exercise training interventions for childhood cancer participants are not yet convincing due to small numbers of participants and insufficient study methodology. Despite that, first results show a trend towards an improved physical fitness in the intervention group compared to the control group. Changes in physical fitness were seen by improved body composition, flexibility, and cardiorespiratory fitness. However, the evidence is limited and these positive effects were not found for the other assessed outcomes, such as muscle strength/endurance, the level of daily activity, health-related quality of life, and fatigue. There is a need for more studies with comparable aims and interventions, using higher numbers of participants and for studies with another childhood cancer population than ALL only.","['Braam, Katja I', 'van der Torre, Patrick', 'Takken, Tim', 'Veening, Margreet A', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder, Eline', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Braam KI', 'van der Torre P', 'Takken T', 'Veening MA', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder E', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology/Hematology,VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20130430,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bone Density', 'Child', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle Strength/physiology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/physiology', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Physical Endurance/physiology', '*Physical Fitness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Range of Motion, Articular/physiology']",,2013/05/02 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008796.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Apr 30;(4):CD008796. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008796.pub2.,4,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016;3:CD008796.

The samples were inoculated into chicken embryo fibroblast and DF-1 cells for virus isolation and identification, respectively. The inoculated cells were screened for three common chicken tumor viruses. Nine strains of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) were identified, and were designated LY1201-LY1209. The env gene from the LY1201 strain was amplified and cloned. All nine resultant env clones (clones 01-09) were sequenced, and the gp85 and gp37 amino acid regions were subjected to homology analysis. Clones 01 and 03 had 10 amino acid deletions in the gp85 region compared to the other seven clones, suggesting that at least two quasispecies with obvious mutations coexist in the same field strain. Among these nine clones, three had identical gp85 and gp37 sequences, and were recognized as the dominant LY1201 quasispecies. The amino acid sequence homology of gp37 and gp85 among the nine clones was 98.5%-100.0% and 96.6%-100.0% respectively, suggesting that the gp85 region of the env gene can better display the quasispecies diversity of ALV-J than gp37.","['Mao, Yaqing', 'Li, Weihua', 'Dong, Xuan', 'Liu, Jinhua', 'Zhao, Peng']","['Mao Y', 'Li W', 'Dong X', 'Liu J', 'Zhao P']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100094, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130501,China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

Inotuzumab ozogamicin, a CD22 monoclonal antibody bound to calicheamicin, is active in ALL. METHODS: Patients with refractory-relapsed ALL received treatment with inotuzumab. The first 49 patients received single-dose, intravenous inotuzumab at doses of 1.3 to 1.8 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks. In the next 41 patients, the schedule was modified to inotuzumab weekly at a dose of 0.8 mg/m2 on day 1 and at a dose of 0.5 mg/m2 on days 8 and 15, every 3 to 4 weeks, based on higher in vitro efficacy with more frequent exposure. RESULTS: Ninety patients were treated; 68% were in salvage 2 or beyond. Overall, 17 patients (19%) achieved a complete response (CR), 27 (30%) had a CR with no platelet recovery (CRp), and 8 (9%) had a bone marrow CR (no recovery of counts), for an overall response rate of 58%. Response rates were similar for single-dose and weekly dose inotuzumab (57% vs 59%, respectively). The median survival was 6.2 months overall, 5.0 months with the single-dose schedule, and 7.3 months with the weekly dose schedule. The median survival was 9.2 months for patients in salvage 1 (37% at 1 year), 4.3 months for patients in salvage 2, and 6.6 months for patients in salvage 3 or later. The median remission duration was 7 months. Reversible bilirubin elevation, fever, and hypotension were observed less frequently on the weekly dose. In total, 36 of 90 patients (40%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

More attention to risk factors for LOHC is needed. We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced leukemia who had been treated with ATG-containing conditioning regimens to evaluate the influence of different doses of ATG on LOHC after haploidentical HSCT. Seventy-five patients undergoing haploidentical HSCT from January 2003 to February 2011 were evaluated. A total of 39 patients receiving transplantation before June 2008 were treated with high-dose ATG (10 mg/kg), whereas 36 patients received low-dose ATG (6 mg/kg) thereafter. LOHC occurred in 16.7% of the patients with low-dose ATG, and in 38.5% of the patients with high-dose ATG (P = 0.027). Univariate analysis showed high-dose ATG, male gender and cytomegalovirus reactivation to be significant risk factors for LOHC. However, only high-dose ATG (HR 2.96, 95% CI 1.143-7.663, P = 0.025) and male gender (HR 4.033, 95% CI 1.355-12.008, P = 0.012) were independent risk factors, as shown by multivariate analysis. In the setting of haploidentical HSCT, we concluded that LOHC is more prevalent in recipients of high-dose ATG and male patients. Future studies should focus on immune reconstitution and virus infection after haploidentical HSCT with 6 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg ATG.","['Fu, Haixia', 'Xu, Lanping', 'Liu, Daihong', 'Zhang, Xiaohui', 'Liu, Kaiyan', 'Chen, Huan', 'Wang, Yu', 'Han, Wei', 'Han, Tingting', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Fu H', 'Xu L', 'Liu D', 'Zhang X', 'Liu K', 'Chen H', 'Wang Y', 'Han W', 'Han T', 'Huang X']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, No 11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130430,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cystitis/*chemically induced/epidemiology/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,2013/05/02 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1350-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Jul;98(1):89-95. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1350-8.

GAVE can develop as a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT-GAVE), and it has been suggested that it may be associated with oral administration of busulfan. We report two cases of HSCT-GAVE after a conditioning regimen containing intra-venous busulfan (ivBu), not oral busulfan. The first case, a 42-year-old woman with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, underwent second allogeneic HSCT with conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and ivBu (12.8 mg/kg). HSCT-GAVE developed on day 84 post-transplant, and argon plasma coagulation (APC) was performed successfully. The second case, a 60-year-old woman with acute myelogenous leukemia, underwent allogeneic HSCT with the conditioning regimen consisting of ivBu (12.8 mg/kg) and fludarabine (150 mg/kg). She developed melena and was diagnosed with GAVE by endoscopy on day 145 post-transplant. Although complete hemostasis was not achieved despite four administrations of APCs, the melena spontaneously terminated on day 235 post-transplant. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing HSCT-GAVE after ivBU-based HSCT.

We find that primary CMML samples demonstrate GM-CSF-dependent hypersensitivity by hematopoietic colony formation assays and phospho-STAT5 (pSTAT5) flow cytometry compared with healthy donors. Among CMML patients, the pSTAT5 hypersensitive response positively correlated with high-risk disease, peripheral leukocytes, monocytes, and signaling-associated mutations. When compared with IL-3 and G-CSF, GM-CSF hypersensitivity was cytokine specific and thus a possible target for intervention in CMML. To explore this possibility, we treated primary CMML cells with KB003, a novel monoclonal anti-GM-CSF antibody, and JAK2 inhibitors. We found that an elevated proportion of immature GM-CSF receptor-alpha(R) subunit-expressing cells were present in the bone marrow myeloid compartment of CMML. In survival assays, we found that myeloid and monocytic progenitors were sensitive to GM-CSF signal inhibition. Our data indicate that a committed myeloid precursor expressing CD38 may represent the progenitor population with enhanced GM-CSF dependence in CMML, consistent with results in JMML. These preclinical data indicate that GM-CSF signaling inhibitors merit further investigation in CMML and that GM-CSFR expression on myeloid progenitors may be a biomarker for this therapy.","['Padron, Eric', 'Painter, Jeffrey S', 'Kunigal, Sateesh', 'Mailloux, Adam W', 'McGraw, Kathy', 'McDaniel, Jessica M', 'Kim, Eunhee', 'Bebbington, Christopher', 'Baer, Mark', 'Yarranton, Geoffrey', 'Lancet, Jeffrey', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'List, Alan F', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K']","['Padron E', 'Painter JS', 'Kunigal S', 'Mailloux AW', 'McGraw K', 'McDaniel JM', 'Kim E', 'Bebbington C', 'Baer M', 'Yarranton G', 'Lancet J', 'Komrokji RS', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'List AF', 'Epling-Burnette PK']","['Department of Hematologic Malignancies, H.

Thus, it is not surprising that distress has been found in as many as 45.5% of patients. Although distress is a regularly reported outcome measure in clinical research, currently, there is a lack of a clear, consistent, and universal definition of this concept. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this article were to examine the current state of the science surrounding the concept of distress and to propose a model of distress for patients with AL. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: The Walker and Avant framework was used to guide the analysis of the concept of distress in patients with AL. The findings from this analysis were then used to generate a model guided by the current science. RESULTS: Distress in AL is generally accepted as multidimensional, quantifiable, subjective, and temporal. Antecedents to distress include demographics, intrinsic factors, social support, disease progression, treatment, and communication. Consequences to distress include decreased quality of life, patient outcomes, as well as the severity of physical and psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Distress is an outcome measure that is frequently assessed and reported within the literature. The operationalization of distress varies by investigator, limiting its generalizability. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The proposed conceptual model may be used to guide further research on distress in patients with AL at high risk for negative outcomes. Improved understanding of patient distress may guide interventions aimed at managing the psychosocial needs for patients receiving treatment for AL.","['Albrecht, Tara A', 'Rosenzweig, Margaret']","['Albrecht TA', 'Rosenzweig M']","['Author Affiliation: School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*nursing/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursing Assessment', 'Nursing Research', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Quality of Life/psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/*nursing']",PMC3779488,2013/05/02 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0b013e31829193ad [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2014 May-Jun;37(3):218-26. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e31829193ad.,3,,,,,['T32 NR011972/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS467632'],,,,,,,,,,

After a median follow-up of 58 months (range, 2 to 160 months), the probability of treatment-related mortality was 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-50%) at 1-year. The 5-year incidence of relapse was 32% (95% CI, 27%-38%), and that of overall survival was 22% (95% CI, 18%-27%). Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly better overal survival with RIC regimens (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35-0.75; P <.001), with Karnofsky Performance Status score >/=90% (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.82: P = .001) and in cytomegalovirus-negative recipients (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44-0.94; P = .022).

We have developed a regimen that targets CD4(+) lymphodepletion to ensure early and durable engraftment. The primary endpoint was achievement of >/=50% CD3(+) donor chimerism by day +28. Forty-two patients (median age, 53 years; range, 29 to 73 years) received pentostatin 4 mg/m(2) i.v. on days -28, -21, and -14 when the CD4(+) cell count was >100 cells/muL and on days -4 and -3 regardless of CD4(+) level. Rituximab 375 mg/m(2) was administered to patients with CD20(+) malignancies on days -21, -14, -7, +1, and +8. Busulfan 200 mg/m(2) i.v. was administered on days -4 and -2 at a dose to target a cumulative AUC dose of 16,000 (+/-10%) mumol.min/L.

The precise molecular mechanisms by which METH usage results in neurotoxicity remain to be fully elucidated, with recent evidence implicating the importance of microglial activation and neuroinflammation in damaged brain regions. METH interacts with sigma receptors which are found in glial cells in addition to neurons. Moreover, sigma receptor antagonists have been shown to block METH-induced neurotoxicity in rodents although the cellular mechanisms underlying their neuroprotection remain unknown. The purpose of the current study was to determine if the prototypic sigma receptor antagonist, SN79, mitigates METH-induced microglial activation and associated increases in cytokine expression in a rodent model of METH-induced neurotoxicity. METH increased striatal mRNA and protein levels of cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), indicative of microglial activation. METH also increased ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) protein expression, further confirming the activation of microglia. Along with microglial activation, METH increased striatal mRNA expression levels of IL-6 family pro-inflammatory cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor (lif), oncostatin m (osm), and interleukin-6 (il-6). Pretreatment with SN79 reduced METH-induced increases in CD68 and IBA-1 expression, demonstrating its ability to prevent microglial activation. SN79 also attenuated METH-induced mRNA increases in IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine family members. The ability of a sigma receptor antagonist to block METH-induced microglial activation and cytokine production provides a novel mechanism through which the neurotoxic effects of METH may be mitigated.","['Robson, Matthew J', 'Turner, Ryan C', 'Naser, Zachary J', 'McCurdy, Christopher R', 'Huber, Jason D', 'Matsumoto, Rae R']","['Robson MJ', 'Turner RC', 'Naser ZJ', 'McCurdy CR', 'Huber JD', 'Matsumoto RR']","['Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, West Virginia University, 1 Medical Center Dr., West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130428,United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Benzoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Body Temperature/drug effects', 'Brain/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methamphetamine/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microglia/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, sigma/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",PMC3742718,2013/05/02 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/02 06:00'],"['2013/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4886(13)00137-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.expneurol.2013.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 2013 Sep;247:134-42. doi: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2013.04.009.

Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinases in AML has shown encouraging results in the treatment of FLT3 mutated AML, but in most patients responses are incomplete and not sustained. Newer, more specific compounds seem to have a higher potency and selectivity against FLT3. During therapy with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) the induction of acquired resistance has emerged as a clinical problem. Therefore, optimization of the targeted therapy and potential treatment options to overcome resistance is currently the focus of clinical research.

In particular, four TRIM family genes are frequently translocated to other genes, generating fusion proteins implicated in cancer initiation and progression. Among these the most famous is the promyelocytic leukaemia gene PML, which encodes the protein TRIM19. PML is involved in the t(15;17) translocation that specifically occurs in Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL), resulting in a PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion protein. Other members of the TRIM family are linked to cancer development without being involved in chromosomal re-arrangements, possibly through ubiquitination or loss of tumour suppression functions.

PML NBs are therefore implicated in a wide variety of cellular functions such as transcriptional regulation, viral response, apoptosis and nuclear protein storage.","['Batty, Elizabeth C', 'Jensen, Kirsten', 'Freemont, Paul S']","['Batty EC', 'Jensen K', 'Freemont PS']","['Macromolecular Structure and Function Group, Division of Molecular Biosciences, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['*Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', '*Cell Compartmentation', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",,2012/01/01 00:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4614-5398-7_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2012;770:39-58. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-5398-7_4.,,,['0 (Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To generate new hypotheses about its etiology, genome-wide transcript analysis was performed on whole blood RNA from women that received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy and either did, or did not develop CHF, as defined by ejection fractions (EF)</=40%. Women with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy unrelated to chemotherapy were compared to breast cancer patients prior to chemo with normal EF to identify heart failure-related transcripts in women not receiving chemotherapy. Byproducts of oxidative stress in plasma were measured in a subset of patients. RESULTS: The results indicate that patients treated with doxorubicin showed sustained elevations in oxidative byproducts in plasma. At the RNA level, women who exhibited low EFs after chemotherapy had 260 transcripts that differed >2-fold (p<0.05) compared to women who received chemo but maintained normal EFs. Most of these transcripts (201) were not altered in non-chemotherapy patients with low EFs. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes indicated enrichment in apoptosis-related transcripts. Notably, women with chemo-induced low EFs had a 4.8-fold decrease in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1A (TCL1A) transcripts. TCL1A is expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, and is a known co-activator for AKT, one of the major pro-survival factors for cardiomyocytes. Further, women who developed low EFs had a 2-fold lower level of ABCB1 transcript, encoding the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), which is an efflux pump for doxorubicin, potentially leading to higher cardiac levels of drug. In vitro studies confirmed that inhibition of MDR1 by verapamil in rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes increased their susceptibility to doxorubicin-induced toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that chemo-induced cardiomyopathy may be due to a reduction in TCL1A levels, thereby causing increased apoptotic sensitivity, and leading to reduced cardiac MDR1 levels, causing higher cardiac levels of doxorubicin and intracellular free radicals. If so, screening for TCL1A and MDR1 SNPs or expression level in blood, might identify women at greatest risk of chemo-induced heart failure.","['McCaffrey, Timothy A', 'Tziros, Constantine', 'Lewis, Jannet', 'Katz, Richard', 'Siegel, Robert', 'Weglicki, William', 'Kramer, Jay', 'Mak, I Tong', 'Toma, Ian', 'Chen, Liang', 'Benas, Elizabeth', 'Lowitt, Alexander', 'Rao, Shruti', 'Witkin, Linda', 'Lian, Yi', 'Lai, Yinglei', 'Yang, Zhaoqing', 'Fu, Sidney W']","['McCaffrey TA', 'Tziros C', 'Lewis J', 'Katz R', 'Siegel R', 'Weglicki W', 'Kramer J', 'Mak IT', 'Toma I', 'Chen L', 'Benas E', 'Lowitt A', 'Rao S', 'Witkin L', 'Lian Y', 'Lai Y', 'Yang Z', 'Fu SW']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Genomic Medicine, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130422,Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Cardiomyopathies/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Rats']",PMC3638290,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijbs.6058 [doi]', 'ijbsv09p0350 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2013 Apr 22;9(4):350-60. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.6058.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2003 and November 2009, 1,179 patients (median age, 48 years; range, 16 to 60 years) with untreated AML were randomly assigned at diagnosis to receive either standard high-dose cytarabine consolidation with three cycles of 18 g/m(2) (3x HD-AraC) or multiagent consolidation with two cycles of mitoxantrone (30 mg/m(2)) plus cytarabine (12 g/m(2)) and one cycle of amsacrine (500 mg/m(2)) plus cytarabine (10 g/m(2); MAC/MAMAC/MAC). Allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantations were performed in a risk-adapted and priority-based manner. RESULTS: After double induction therapy using a 3 + 7 regimen including standard-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin, complete remission was achieved in 65% of patients. In the primary efficacy population of patients evaluable for consolidation outcomes, consolidation with either 3x HD-AraC or MAC/MAMC/MAC did not result in any significant difference in 3-year overall (69% v 64%; P = .18) or disease-free survival (46% v 48%; P = .99) according to the intention-to-treat analysis. Furthermore, MAC/MAMAC/MAC led to additional GI and hepatic toxicity and a higher rate of infection and bleeding, resulting in significantly shorter 3-year overall survival in the per-protocol analysis compared with 3x HD-AraC (63% v 72%; P = .04). CONCLUSION: In younger adults with AML, multiagent consolidation using mitoxantrone and amsacrine in combination with high-dose cytarabine does not improve treatment outcome and confers additional toxicity.","['Schaich, Markus', 'Parmentier, Stefani', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Aulitzky, Walter', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Krause, Stefan W', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Schaich M', 'Parmentier S', 'Kramer M', 'Illmer T', 'Stolzel F', 'Rollig C', 'Thiede C', 'Hanel M', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Aulitzky W', 'Einsele H', 'Ho AD', 'Serve H', 'Berdel WE', 'Mayer J', 'Schmitz N', 'Krause SW', 'Neubauer A', 'Baldus CD', 'Schetelig J', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany. markus.schaich@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20130429,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.46.4743 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.46.4743 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jun 10;31(17):2094-102. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.46.4743.

To ascertain the significance of this gene fusion, we explored its frequency, clinical impact, and gene expression pattern using DNA microarray in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. NUP98-NSD1 fusion transcripts were detected in 6 (4.8%) of 124 pediatric AML patients. Supervised hierarchical clustering analyses using probe sets that were differentially expressed in these patients detected a characteristic gene expression pattern, including 18 NUP98-NSD1-negative patients (NUP98-NSD1-like patients). In total, a NUP98-NSD1-related gene expression signature (NUP98-NSD1 signature) was found in 19% (24/124) and in 58% (15/26) of cytogenetically normal cases. Their 4-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were poor (33.3% in NUP98-NSD1-positive and 38.9% in NUP98-NSD1-like patients) compared with 100 NUP98-NSD1 signature-negative patients (4-year OS: 86.0%, 4-year EFS: 72.0%).

In contrast, half of the deep-seated soft tissue ME tumors lacking ductal differentiation are known to be genetically unrelated, showing EWSR1 rearrangements. FISH analysis to detect PLAG1 and HMGA2 abnormalities was performed in 35 ME tumors, nine skin and 26 soft tissue, lacking EWSR1 and FUS rearrangements. For the PLAG1-rearranged tumors, FISH and RACE were performed to identify potential fusion partners, including CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) on 3p21 and LIFR (leukemia inhibitory factor receptor) on 5p13. Recurrent PLAG1 rearrangement by FISH was detected in 13 (37%) lesions, including three (33%) in the skin and 10 (38%) in the soft tissue. All were classified as benign and all except one showed abundant tubulo-ductal differentiation (comprising 12/24 [50%] of all tumors with ductal structures). A LIFR-PLAG1 fusion was detected by RACE and then confirmed by FISH in one soft tissue ME tumor with tubular formation. No CTNNB1 or LIFR abnormalities were detected in any of the remaining PLAG1-rearranged tumors. No structural HMGA2 abnormalities were detected in any of the 22 ME lesions tested.

Because the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), our objective was to identify ABL targets in the ER. A phosphoproteomic analysis of canine pancreatic ER microsomes identified 49 high scoring phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. These were then categorized in silico and validated in vitro. We demonstrated that the ER-resident human protein serine palmitoyltransferase long chain-1 (SPTLC1), which is the first enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis, is phosphorylated at Tyr(164) by the tyrosine kinase ABL. Inhibition of BCR-ABL using either imatinib or shRNA-mediated silencing led to the activation of SPTLC1 and to increased apoptosis in both K562 and LAMA-84 cells. Finally, we demonstrated that mutation of Tyr(164) to Phe in SPTLC1 increased serine palmitoyltransferase activity. The Y164F mutation also promoted the remodeling of cellular sphingolipid content, thereby sensitizing K562 cells to apoptosis. Our observations provide a mechanistic explanation for imatinib-mediated cell death and a novel avenue for therapeutic strategies.","['Taouji, Said', 'Higa, Arisa', 'Delom, Frederic', 'Palcy, Sandrine', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max', 'Bosse, Roger', 'Segui, Bruno', 'Chevet, Eric']","['Taouji S', 'Higa A', 'Delom F', 'Palcy S', 'Mahon FX', 'Pasquet JM', 'Bosse R', 'Segui B', 'Chevet E']","['INSERM U1053, 33076 Bordeaux, France. said.taouji@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130429,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', '*Cell Survival', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Golgi Apparatus/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Microsomes/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Serine C-Palmitoyltransferase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",PMC3682524,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/08/22 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45865-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.409185 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Jun 14;288(24):17190-201. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.409185.

MLL5 protein, a member of the Trithorax protein family, has been implicated in the control of the cell cycle progression; however, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) have not been fully determined. In this study, we found that the MLL5 protein can associate with the cell cycle regulator ""host cell factor"" (HCF-1). The interaction between MLL5 and HCF-1 is mediated by the ""HCF-1 binding motif"" (HBM) of the MLL5 protein and the Kelch domain of the HCF-1 protein. Confocal microscopy showed that the MLL5 protein largely colocalized with HCF-1 in the nucleus. Knockdown of MLL5 resulted in reduced cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Moreover, down-regulation of E2F1 target gene expression and decreased H3K4me3 levels at E2F1-responsive promoters were observed in MLL5 knockdown cells. Additionally, the core subunits, including ASH2L, RBBP5, and WDR5, that are necessary for effective H3K4 methyltransferase activities of the Trithorax protein complexes, were absent in the MLL5 complex, suggesting that a distinct mechanism may be used by MLL5 for exerting its H3K4 methyltransferase activity. Together, our findings demonstrate that MLL5 could associate with HCF-1 and then be recruited to E2F1-responsive promoters to stimulate H3K4 trimethylation and transcriptional activation, thereby facilitating the cell cycle G1 to S phase transition.","['Zhou, Peipei', 'Wang, Zhilong', 'Yuan, Xiujie', 'Zhou, Cuihong', 'Liu, Lulu', 'Wan, Xiaoling', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Ding, Xiaodan', 'Wang, Chuangui', 'Xiong, Sidong', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Yuan, Jinduo', 'Li, Qiang', 'Zhang, Yan']","['Zhou P', 'Wang Z', 'Yuan X', 'Zhou C', 'Liu L', 'Wan X', 'Zhang F', 'Ding X', 'Wang C', 'Xiong S', 'Wang Z', 'Yuan J', 'Li Q', 'Zhang Y']","['Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunology, Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130429,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Host Cell Factor C1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC3682552,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/08/22 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45893-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.439729 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Jun 14;288(24):17532-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.439729.

The recombinant protein was purified via a single chromatographic step using an affinity tag-based protein purification system that processed by cleavage with sodium fluoride, resulting in the complete proteolytic removal the N-terminal tag. Soluble rhLIF yield was estimated to be approximately 1mg/g of wet weight cells, with above 98% purity.

Here, we compare its performance with that of a well-established preclinical PET scanner. METHODS: Subcutaneous and lung tumor xenografts were used to compare lesion detectability and treatment responses to chemotherapy (gemcitabine) using (18)F-FDG PET. The size of subcutaneous xenografts (L1210 and L1210-10K leukemia cells) and lung metastases (B-16 melanoma cells) was measured on small-animal CT images. Tumor (18)F-FDG uptake was expressed as percentage injected dose per gram. Using list-mode data, serial images of the left ventricular blood pool were used to generate time-activity curves. RESULTS: Subcutaneous xenografts (range, 4-12 mm; mean +/- SD, 6.1 +/- 1.7 mm) and lung metastases (range, 1-5 mm; mean, 2.1 +/- 1.2 mm) were detected equally well with both scanners. Tumor (18)F-FDG uptake measured with both scanners was highly correlated for subcutaneous xenografts (r(2) = 0.93) and lung metastases (r(2) = 0.83). The new Genisys4 scanner and the established scanner provided comparable treatment response information (r(2) = 0.93). Dynamic imaging sequences permitted the generation of left ventricular blood-pool time-activity curves with both scanners. CONCLUSION: Using subcutaneous and lung xenografts, a novel and an established preclinical PET scanner provided equivalent information with regard to lesion detection, tumor (18)F-FDG uptake, tumor response to treatment, and generation of time-activity curves. Thus, the Genisys4 provides a small, efficient bench-top preclinical PET alternative for quantitatively studying murine tumor models in biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology laboratories and preclinical imaging centers.","['Herrmann, Ken', 'Dahlbom, Magnus', 'Nathanson, David', 'Wei, Liu', 'Radu, Caius', 'Chatziioannou, Arion', 'Czernin, Johannes']","['Herrmann K', 'Dahlbom M', 'Nathanson D', 'Wei L', 'Radu C', 'Chatziioannou A', 'Czernin J']","['Ahmanson Translational Imaging Division, Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095-1782, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20130429,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Miniaturization', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*diagnostic imaging', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*instrumentation/*veterinary', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC3790646,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['jnumed.112.114926 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.112.114926 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2013 Jul;54(7):1162-7. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.112.114926.

We demonstrated that in the presence of LIF, the activation of PPARgamma by Rosiglitazone led to an increased proliferation of mESCs whereas PPARgamma antagonist (GW9662) reversed this effect. Additionally, upon PPARgamma activation, LIF increased PPARgamma expression and resulted in the degradation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), an important negative regulator of LIF/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-pathway. In the absence of LIF, Rosiglitazone decreased proliferation of mESCs. In this state, our results showed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) proteins were activated and resulted in the suppression of Nanog expression, an important pluripotency determinant, whereas it did not affect Oct4 expression. These results suggest that the pivotal role of PPARgamma on mESC self-renewal depends on the presence and absence of LIF.","['Peymani, Maryam', 'Ghoochani, Ali', 'Ghaedi, Kamran', 'Karamali, Fereshteh', 'Karbalaie, Khadijeh', 'Kiani-Esfahani, Abbas', 'Rabiee, Farzaneh', 'Nasr-Esfahani, Mohammad Hossein', 'Baharvand, Hossein']","['Peymani M', 'Ghoochani A', 'Ghaedi K', 'Karamali F', 'Karbalaie K', 'Kiani-Esfahani A', 'Rabiee F', 'Nasr-Esfahani MH', 'Baharvand H']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology at Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Biotechnology, ACECR, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130404,Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,IM,"['Anilides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'PPAR gamma/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Rosiglitazone', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology']",,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-9335(13)00036-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2013.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2013 Apr-May;92(4-5):160-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2013.03.003.

We collected repeat dust samples from 292 households in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during two sampling rounds (from 2001 to 2007 and during 2010) using household vacuum cleaners and measured 22 PBDEs using high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Median concentrations for individual PBDEs ranged from <0.1-2500ng per g of dust. For each of eight representative PBDEs, we used a random-effects model to apportion total variance into regional variability (0-11%), intra-regional between-household variability (17-50%), within-household variability over time (38-74%), and within-sample variability (0-23%) and we used a mixed-effects model to identify determinants of PBDE levels. Regional differences in PBDE dust levels were associated with residential characteristics that differed by region, including the presence of furniture with exposed or crumbling foam and the recent installation of carpets in the residence. Intra-regional differences between households were associated with neighborhood urban density, racial and ethnic characteristics, and to a lesser extent, income. For some PBDEs, a decreasing time trend explained a modest fraction of the within-household variability; however, most of the within-household variability was unaccounted for by our mixed-effects models. Our findings indicate that it may be feasible to use residential dust for retrospective assessment of PBDE exposures in studies of children's health (e.g., the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study).","['Whitehead, Todd P', 'Brown, F Reber', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Park, June-Soo', 'Does, Monique', 'Petreas, Myrto X', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Rappaport, Stephen M']","['Whitehead TP', 'Brown FR', 'Metayer C', 'Park JS', 'Does M', 'Petreas MX', 'Buffler PA', 'Rappaport SM']","['University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, 50 University Hall, MC 7360, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. toddpwhitehead@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130427,Netherlands,Environ Int,Environment international,7807270,IM,"['Air Pollutants/*analysis', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'California', 'Child', 'Dust/*analysis', 'Environmental Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers/*analysis', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC3668857,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0160-4120(13)00065-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.envint.2013.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Int. 2013 Jul;57-58:11-24. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2013.03.003.

Here, we used a phosphoproteomic approach to investigate biological heterogeneity across hematological cancer cell lines including acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. RESULTS: Mass spectrometry was used to quantify 2,000 phosphorylation sites across three acute myeloid leukemia, three lymphoma, and three multiple myeloma cell lines in six biological replicates. The intensities of the phosphorylation sites grouped these cancer cell lines according to their tumor type. In addition, a phosphoproteomic analysis of seven acute myeloid leukemia cell lines revealed a battery of phosphorylation sites whose combined intensities correlated with the growth-inhibitory responses to three kinase inhibitors with remarkable correlation coefficients and fold changes (> 100 between the most resistant and sensitive cells). Modeling based on regression analysis indicated that a subset of phosphorylation sites could be used to predict response to the tested drugs. Quantitative analysis of phosphorylation motifs indicated that resistant and sensitive cells differed in their patterns of kinase activities, but, interestingly, phosphorylations correlating with responses were not on members of the pathway being targeted; instead, these mainly were on parallel kinase pathways. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that the information on kinase activation encoded in phosphoproteomics data correlates remarkably well with the phenotypic responses of cancer cells to compounds that target kinase signaling and could be useful for the identification of novel markers of resistance or sensitivity to drugs that target the signaling network.","['Casado, Pedro', 'Alcolea, Maria P', 'Iorio, Francesco', 'Rodriguez-Prados, Juan-Carlos', 'Vanhaesebroeck, Bart', 'Saez-Rodriguez, Julio', 'Joel, Simon', 'Cutillas, Pedro R']","['Casado P', 'Alcolea MP', 'Iorio F', 'Rodriguez-Prados JC', 'Vanhaesebroeck B', 'Saez-Rodriguez J', 'Joel S', 'Cutillas PR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130429,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteome/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism']",PMC4054101,2013/05/01 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gb-2013-14-4-r37 [pii]', '10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r37 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2013 Apr 29;14(4):R37. doi: 10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r37.,4,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteome)']",,,"['BB/G015023/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0700755/82351/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the antioncogene is mutated or absent, the function of cells will be weakened and inactivated, the cells will be duplicated repeatedly out of control, then will induce occurrence and metastasis of tumor. For example, SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase, as an antioncogene, is a key negative regulator in signaling transduction of haematopoietic cells. The decrease and silence of SHP-1 play an important role in tumorigenesis. If the oncogene in leukemia patients lost the effect of negative regulation of antioncogene, the oncogene would be expressed abnormally high, such as the oncogene c-kit (an important member of the class III in the tyrosine kinase receptor family) in many kinds of leukemia cells expresses actively.

The DNA ladder was used to detect cell apoptosis. The results indicated that DAC significantly inhibited the proliferation of NB4 and K562 cells in dose-and time-dependent manner. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DAC-treated NB4 and K562 cells for 72 h was 0.113 micromol/L and 0.138 micromol/L, respectively. After treating these two cell lines with DAC at different concentration for 72 h, the cell ratio in G0/G1 phase significantly increased, while the cell ratio in S phase obviously decreased in 0.15 micromol/L DAC group (P < 0.05). The expression levels of myeloid differentiation antigen CD11b of both cell lines significantly increased in contrast to the control group (P < 0.05). The cell morphology detected by Wright's staining displayed partial differentiation and apoptosis after treating NB4 and K562 cells with DAC for 48 h.

The correlation between these blood coagulation indexes and the possible correlative clinical characteristics were analysed, including age, sex, type of acute leukemia, initial white blood cell(WBC) and platelet(Plt) count, the proportion of blast cells in bone marrow and cytogenetic abnormality of patients at diagnosis. The results indicated that the incidence of abnormal blood coagulation was as high as 78.1% for de novo AL patients. These patients with 5 normal blood coagulation indexes may have mild bleeding manifestation, but the more abnormal indexes, the more severe bleeding. Both PT and D-D were sensitive indexes for diagnosis of level II bleeding. Incidence of abnormal blood coagulation significantly correlates with the proportion of blast cells in bone marrow (chi(2) = 4.184, OR = 1.021, P < 0.05) and more with D-D (P < 0.01), while age, sex, type of AL, WBC count, Plt count and abnormality of cytogenetics did not correlate with abnormal blood coagulation. It is concluded that the coagulation and fibrinolysis are abnormal in most patients with de novo acute leukemia. More abnormal indexes indicate more severe bleeding, and both PT and D-D are sensitive indexes for diagnosis of level II bleeding. Higher proportion of blast cells in bone marrow predicts higher incidence of abnormal blood clotting. Acute leukemia with elderly age, high white blood cell count and adverse cytogenetics do not predict severer abnormal blood clotting.

The methylation pattem in promoter region of RUNX2 gene was detected with bisulfite sequencing PCR, DNA methylation immunoprecipitation technique and promoter oligonucleotide microarray analysis and the expression levels of RUNX2 mRNA was detected with RT-PCR in 3 T-ALL cell lines (sil-ALL, DND41 and RPMI), as well as in 75 clinic bone marrow samples including 38 de novo T-ALL patients, 29 complete remission T-ALL patients and 8 normal samples. The results showed that there were hypermethylation of CpG island in promoter region of RUNX2 gene in patients with highly expressing HOX11(+) T-ALL. The methylation rate of the promoter CpG islands of RUNX2 gene in HOX11(+) T-ALL (78.9%) was significantly higher than that in HOX11(-) T-ALL (36.8%) (P < 0.01). The expression of RUNX2 in HOX11(+) cell lines was significantly lower than that in HOX11(-) cell lines, and the expression level of RUNX2 in the HOX11(+) T-ALL patients (0.581 +/- 0.257) was significantly lower than that in HOX11(-) T-ALL patients (0.835 +/- 0.317).

The expression levels of RUNX2 gene negatively correlated with the methylation of CpG island in its promoter region (rs = -0.419, P < 0.01). It is concluded that HOX11 is a negative regulator of RUNX2 gene and the expression of RUNX2 is down regulated or even lost by promoter methylation in T-ALL, which demonstrate a better event-free survival and a marked trend for longer overall survival for HOX11-high T-ALLs.

Indeed, based on its selective non-genotoxic p53 activation, Nutlin-3 might represent an alternative to the current cytotoxic chemotherapy. To overcome the poor bioavailability of Nutlin-3, we have assessed the potential efficacy of Nutlin-3 loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NP) against hematological malignancies. To test the specificity of the anti-leukemic activity, we have used leukemic cell lines characterized by different p53 status (JVM-2 and BJAB). NP loaded with Nutlin-3 (NP-Nutlin) were rapidly taken up by the leukemic cells and were as effective as native Nutlin-3 in promoting both induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in p53(wild-type) JVM-2 cells, but not in p53(mutated) BJAB cells. Moreover, injection of NP-Nutlin, but not of free Nutlin-3, in a JVM-2-derived xenograft mouse model, reduced the subcutaneous tumor volume and promoted induction of apoptosis in the tumor mass.

The nature and intent of the registry was to gain a comprehensive view of the use, safety and efficacy of the drug in a broad range of AML-patients treated in real-life scenarios. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The sole inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of WHO-AML and treatment with at least one dose of azacitidine. No formal exclusion criteria existed. A total of 155 AML-patients who were mostly unfit/ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, or had progressed despite conventional treatment, were included. True ITT-analyses and exploratory analyses regarding the potential prognostic value of baseline-variables/performance-/comorbidity-/risk-scores on overall survival (OS), were performed. RESULTS: In this cohort of 155 pretreated (60%), and/or comorbid (87%), elderly (45% >/=75 years) AML-patients, azacitidine was well tolerated and efficacious, with an overall response rate (CR, mCR, PR, HI) of 45% in the total cohort (ITT) and 65% in patients evaluable according to IWG-criteria, respectively. Pre-treatment with conventional chemotherapy (P = .113), age </=/>80 years (P = .853), number of comorbidities (P = .476), and bone marrow (BM) blast count (P = .663) did not influence OS. In multivariate analysis hematologic improvement alone (without the requirement of concomitant bone marrow blast reduction), although currently not regarded as a standard form of response assessment in AML, was sufficient to confer OS benefit (18.9 vs. 6.0 months; P = .0015). Further deepening of response after first response was associated with improved OS (24.7 vs. 13.7 months; P < .001).

METHODS: A preliminary and post-induction chemotherapy assessment of patients' nutritional status, quality of life, sociodemographic status and medical characteristics was conducted using the Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life (QOL-C30, version 3) questionnaires. The PG-SGA is a clinical nutrition assessment tool used to evaluate oncology patients. Patients with newly-diagnosed acute leukaemia, aged >/=15 years, at three hospitals in Tehran (from May 2009 to March 2010), were recruited for the present study. RESULTS: Sixty-three acute leukaemia patients [65% men and 35% women with a mean (SD) age of 33 (15.4) years] participated in the present study. A total of 19.4% were found to be malnourished prior to chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, 76.1% of patients were considered moderately malnourished, whereas 6.3% were severely malnourished. After induction chemotherapy, both the nutritional status and quality of life deteriorated in the majority of patients, as demonstrated by a paired t-test. CONCLUSIONS: A deteriorated nutritional status and quality of life was the result of the side effects posed by induction chemotherapy in the patients investigated in the present study. These findings highlight the need for an appropriate nutritional support programme to improve the nutritional status and quality of life in patients with leukaemia undergoing chemotherapy.","['Malihi, Z', 'Kandiah, M', 'Chan, Y M', 'Hosseinzadeh, M', 'Sohanaki Azad, M', 'Zarif Yeganeh, M']","['Malihi Z', 'Kandiah M', 'Chan YM', 'Hosseinzadeh M', 'Sohanaki Azad M', 'Zarif Yeganeh M']","['Alumni Centre, Academic Division, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130430,England,J Hum Nutr Diet,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,8904840,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Nutrition Assessment', '*Nutritional Status', 'Prospective Studies', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,2013/05/01 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jhn.12043 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hum Nutr Diet. 2013 Jul;26 Suppl 1:123-31. doi: 10.1111/jhn.12043.

A significantly lower MALT1 and A20 expression level was found in T cells from patients with AML compared with healthy controls (p = 0.045, p < 0.0001); however, the expression level of MALT1-V1 (variant 1) was significantly higher in the AML group than in the healthy control group (p = 0.006), and the expression level of NF-kappaB was increased in the AML group. In conclusion, the characteristics of the expression pattern of MALT1-A20-NF-kappaB and the distribution of MALT1 variants in T cells from AML were first characterized. Overall, low TCR-CD3 signaling is related to low MALT1 expression, which may related to T cell immunodeficiency, while the up-regulation of MALT1-V1 may play a role in overcoming the T cell activity by downregulating A20 in patients with AML, which may be related to a specific response to AML-associated antigens.","['Shi, Li', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Wang, Xu', 'Xu, Ling', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Li, Bo', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Shi L', 'Chen S', 'Lu Y', 'Wang X', 'Xu L', 'Zhang F', 'Yang L', 'Wu X', 'Li B', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130430,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,PMC3641943,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/05/01 06:01,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-13-37 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-13-37 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2013 Apr 30;13(1):37. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-13-37.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the poor stability, limited availability, and complexity of these structures have precluded their use in practical devices. One solution to these limitations is to develop simpler molecular systems through chemical synthesis that mimic the salient properties of artificial ion channels. Inspired by natural channel proteins, our group has developed a family of peptide nanostructures thatcreate channels for ions by aligning crown ethers on top of each other when they adopt an alpha-helical conformation. Advantages to this crown ether/peptide framework approach include the ease of synthesis, the predictability of their conformations, and the ability to fine-tune and engineer their properties. We have synthesized these structures using solid phase methods from artificial crown ether amino acids made from L-DOPA. Circular dichroism and FTIR spectroscopy studies in different media confirmed that the nanostructures adopt the predicted alpha-helical conformation. Fluorescence studies verified the crown ether stacking arrangement. We confirmed the channel activity by single-channel measurements using a modified patch-clamp technique, planar lipid bilayer (PLB) assays, and various vesicle experiments. From the results, we estimate that a 6 A distance between two relays is ideal for sodium cation transport, but relatively efficient ion transport can still occur with an 11 A distance between two crown ethers. Biophysical studies demonstrated that peptide channels operate as monomers in an equilibrium between adsorption at the surface and an active, transmembrane orientation. Toward practical applications of these systems, we have prepared channel analogs that bear a biotin moiety, and we have used them as nanotransducers successfully to detect avidin. Analogs of channel peptide nanostructures showed cytotoxicity against breast and leukemia cancer cells. Overall, we have prepared well-defined nanostructures with designed properties, demonstrated their transport abilities, and described their mechanism of action. We have also illustrated the advantages and the versatility of polypeptides for the construction of functional nanoscale artificial ion channels.","['Otis, Francois', 'Auger, Michele', 'Voyer, Normand']","['Otis F', 'Auger M', 'Voyer N']","['Departement de Chimie and PROTEO, Faculte des Sciences et de Genie, Universite Laval , Pavillon Alexandre-Vachon, 1045 avenue de la Medecine, Quebec, Quebec G1V 0A6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130429,United States,Acc Chem Res,Accounts of chemical research,0157313,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Crown Ethers/chemistry', 'Humans', '*Ion Channels/chemistry', 'Ion Transport', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/*chemistry']",,2013/05/01 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ar400044k [doi]'],ppublish,Acc Chem Res. 2013 Dec 17;46(12):2934-43. doi: 10.1021/ar400044k.

ANIMALS: 307 lactating cows from 16 dairy herds with high BLV seroprevalence. PROCEDURES: Blood samples were collected for assessment of plasma anti-BLV p24 antibody concentration (all cows), manual determination of WBC count (161 BLV-seronegative cows from 15 herds), and evaluation of bPVL (146 cows from another herd). RESULTS: The WBC count reference interval (ie, mean +/- 2 SD) for BLV-seronegative dairy cows was 2,153 to 11,493 cells/muL. Of the 146 cows used to analyze the correlation between WBC count and bPVL, 107 (73%) had WBC counts within the reference interval; of those cows, only 21 (19.6%) had high bPVL. Most cows with high WBC counts (35/39) had high bPVL. Mean WBC count for cows with high bPVL was significantly higher than values for cows with low or undetectable bPVL. White blood cell counts and bPVL were significantly (rho = 0.71) correlated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data have provided an updated reference interval for WBC counts in Holstein cows from herds with high BLV seroprevalence. In dairy cattle under natural conditions, WBC count was correlated with bPVL; thus, WBC count determination could be a potential tool for monitoring BLV infection levels in attempts to control transmission.","['Alvarez, Irene', 'Gutierrez, Geronimo', 'Gammella, Mariela', 'Martinez, Cecilia', 'Politzki, Romina', 'Gonzalez, Cintia', 'Caviglia, Luciana', 'Carignano, Hugo', 'Fondevila, Norberto', 'Poli, Mario', 'Trono, Karina']","['Alvarez I', 'Gutierrez G', 'Gammella M', 'Martinez C', 'Politzki R', 'Gonzalez C', 'Caviglia L', 'Carignano H', 'Fondevila N', 'Poli M', 'Trono K']","['Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), CC 1686, Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, Argentina. ialvarez@cnia.inta.gov.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Biomarkers', 'Cattle', 'Dairying', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*blood/immunology/virology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count/*veterinary', 'Viral Load/*veterinary']",,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/10/25 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/ajvr.74.5.744 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2013 May;74(5):744-9. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.74.5.744.,5,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case study of investigating the adhesions between leukemia cells and bone marrow stromal cells is reported. First, the trapping force imposed on the cell is calibrated and the viability of leukemia cells after optical trapping is tested and verified. This is for demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed optical manipulation method. Second, properties of adhesions of leukemia cells K562 on stromal cells M210B4 from mouse and HS5 from human are characterized. Based on characterization results, we classify adhesions into three categories namely tightly adherent, loosely adherent or free suspending. Finally, the adhesion abilities of K562 on M210B4 and HS5 are changed by adding heparin into culture medium, which demonstrates the specificity of the adhesion. The important contribution of this paper lies in development of a dexterous cell manipulation method to characterize cell adhesion properties, which helps create a new opportunity to investigate cell-to-cell interactions at single cell level.","['Hu, Songyu', 'Gou, Xue', 'Han, Hochun', 'Leung, Anskar Y H', 'Sun, Dong']","['Hu S', 'Gou X', 'Han H', 'Leung AY', 'Sun D']","['Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biomed Nanotechnol,Journal of biomedical nanotechnology,101230869,IM,"['Animals', 'Calibration', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', '*Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', '*Optical Tweezers', 'Propidium/metabolism']",,2013/05/01 06:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2013/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jbn.2013.1528 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Nanotechnol. 2013 Feb;9(2):281-5. doi: 10.1166/jbn.2013.1528.,2,,"['36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, high AA markedly induced apoptosis in various leukemic cell lines by generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) but not in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. High AA significantly repressed leukemic cell proliferation as well as neoangiogenesis in immunodeficient mice. We then noted that in leukemic cells, HIF-1alpha transcription was strongly suppressed by high AA and correlated with the transcription of VEGF. Our data indicate that exposure to high AA markedly increased the intracellular AA content of leukemic cells and inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which mediates expression of HIF-1alpha. We next generated K562 cells that overexpressed HIF-1alpha (K562-HIF1alpha cells) and assessed the mechanistic relationship between inhibition of HIF-1alpha transcription and the antileukemic effect of high AA. The ability of high AA to induce apoptosis was significantly lower in K562-HIF1alpha cells than in K562 cells in vitro. We found that expression of HIF-1alpha-regulated antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, such as Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2, was significantly suppressed by high AA in K562 cells, but was sustained at higher levels in K562-HIF1alpha cells, regardless of high AA exposure. Moreover, repression of cell proliferation and neoangiogenesis by high AA was completely abrogated in mice receiving transplants of K562-HIF1alpha cells. These results indicate that, along with H2O2 generation, downregulation of HIF-1alpha transcription plays a crucial role in growth inhibition of human leukemic cells by high AA.","['Kawada, Hiroshi', 'Kaneko, Mitsuyo', 'Sawanobori, Masakazu', 'Uno, Tomoko', 'Matsuzawa, Hideyuki', 'Nakamura, Yoshihiko', 'Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Ando, Kiyoshi']","['Kawada H', 'Kaneko M', 'Sawanobori M', 'Uno T', 'Matsuzawa H', 'Nakamura Y', 'Matsushita H', 'Ando K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan. hkawada@is.icc.u-tokai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130423,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3633866,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0062717 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-20781 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 23;8(4):e62717. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062717.

Human clinical trials have shown that some vector integration events lead to disrupted regulation of proto-oncogenes resulting in disordered hematopoiesis including T-cell leukemia. Newer vectors have been designed to decrease the incidence of these adverse events but require appropriate pre-clinical assays to demonstrate safety. We have used two distinct mouse serial transplant assays to evaluate the safety of a self-inactivating lentiviral vector intended for use in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) gene therapy trials. These experiments entailed 28 months of total follow-up and included 386 mice. There were no cases in which the XSCID lentiviral vector clearly caused hematopoietic malignancies, although a single case of B cell malignancy was observed that contained the lentiviral vector as a likely passenger event. In contrast, a SFFV-DsRed gamma-retroviral vector resulted in clonal transformation events in multiple secondary recipients. Non-specific pathology not related to vector insertions was noted including T cell leukemias arising from irradiated recipient cells. Overall, this comprehensive study of mouse transplant safety assays demonstrate the relative safety of the XSCID lentiviral vector but also highlight the limitations of these assays.","['Zhou, Sheng', 'Ma, Zhijun', 'Lu, Taihe', 'Janke, Laura', 'Gray, John T', 'Sorrentino, Brian P']","['Zhou S', 'Ma Z', 'Lu T', 'Janke L', 'Gray JT', 'Sorrentino BP']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130423,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Female', 'Gene Order', 'Genetic Vectors/*adverse effects/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1/genetics', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'X-Linked Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases/genetics']",PMC3633865,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0062333 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-02765 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 23;8(4):e62333. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062333.

Normal skeletal muscle growth, development, and function are dependent on correctly functioning muscle satellite cells, muscle motor neurons, and muscle mitochondria. Each of these key components is potentially susceptible to damage by chemotherapy in childhood, particularly prolonged courses including repeated administration of combination chemotherapy. If this chemotherapy-induced damage is not fully reversible, impairment of satellite cells, muscle motor innervation, and mitochondria could, either singly or together, lead to the emergence of delayed or persistent skeletal muscle dysfunction many years later.

Disruption of MKL1 activity by either a dominant negative mutant or small interfering RNA mediated knockdown dampened ET-1 synthesis. MKL1 was recruited to the proximal ET-1 promoter region (-81/+150) in HVECs challenged with hypoxic stress by the sequence-specific transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). Depletion of SRF blocked MKL1 recruitment and blunted ET-1 transactivation by hypoxia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the ET-1 promoter revealed that MKL1 loss-of-function erased histone modifications consistent with transcriptional activation. In addition, MKL1 was indispensable for the occupancy of Brg1 and Brm, key components of the chromatin remodeling complex, on the ET-1 promoter.

Thus, p300 represents a potential anticancer therapeutic target. To discover novel anticancer agents that target p300, we conducted a high-throughput screening campaign. A library of 622,079 compounds was assayed for cytotoxicity to the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 but not to the human mammary epithelial cells. The resulting compounds were tested in a biochemical assay for inhibiting the enzymatic activity of p300. One compound (L002, NSC764414) displayed an IC50 of 1.98 mumol/L against p300 in vitro, inhibited acetylation of histones and p53, and suppressed STAT3 activation in cell-based assays. L002 could be docked to the active site of the p300 catalytic domain. Biochemical tests of a series of related compounds revealed functional groups that may impact inhibitory potency of L002 against p300. Interestingly, these analogs showed inhibitory activities against the cellular paralog of p300 (CBP), p300/CBP-associated factor, and GCN5, but not to other acetyltransferases (KAT5, KAT6B, and KAT7), histone deacetylases, and histone methyltransferases. Among the NCI-60 panel of cancer cell lines, leukemia and lymphoma cell lines were extremely sensitive to L002, whereas it is toxic to only a limited number of cell lines derived from solid tumors. Notably, breast cancer cell lines, especially those derived from TNBC, were highly susceptible to L002. In vivo, it potently suppressed tumor growth and histone acetylation of MDA-MB-468 xenografts. Thus, these new acetyltransferase inhibitors are potential anticancer therapeutics.","['Yang, Heng', 'Pinello, Christie E', 'Luo, Jian', 'Li, Dawei', 'Wang, Yunfei', 'Zhao, Lisa Y', 'Jahn, Stephan C', 'Saldanha, Sanjay Adrian', 'Chase, Peter', 'Planck, Jamie', 'Geary, Kyla R', 'Ma, Haiching', 'Law, Brian K', 'Roush, William R', 'Hodder, Peter', 'Liao, Daiqing']","['Yang H', 'Pinello CE', 'Luo J', 'Li D', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao LY', 'Jahn SC', 'Saldanha SA', 'Chase P', 'Planck J', 'Geary KR', 'Ma H', 'Law BK', 'Roush WR', 'Hodder P', 'Liao D']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Shands Cancer Center and Genetics Institute, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida 100235, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130426,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', '*Small Molecule Libraries', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",PMC3651759,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0930 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0930 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 May;12(5):610-20. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0930.

In this study, a comparative analysis of the growth inhibitory properties and apoptosis induction potentials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on T cells was performed. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in T cell proliferation along with distinct impacts on the cell cycle progression. This was at least partially associated with an enhanced induction of apoptosis although triggered by distinct apoptotic mechanisms. In contrast to sunitinib and sorafenib, axitinib did not affect the mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) but resulted in an induction or stabilization of the induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1), leading to an irreversible arrest in the G2/M cell cycle phase and delayed apoptosis. Furthermore, the sorafenib-mediated suppression of immune effector cells, in particular the reduction of the CD8(+) T cell subset along with the down-regulation of key immune cell markers such as chemokine CC motif receptor 7 (CCR7), CD26, CD69, CD25, and CXCR3, was not observed in axitinib-treated immune effector cells. Therefore, axitinib rather than sorafenib seems to be suitable for implementation in complex treatment regimens of cancer patients including immunotherapy.","['Stehle, Franziska', 'Schulz, Kristin', 'Fahldieck, Corinna', 'Kalich, Jana', 'Lichtenfels, Rudolf', 'Riemann, Dagmar', 'Seliger, Barbara']","['Stehle F', 'Schulz K', 'Fahldieck C', 'Kalich J', 'Lichtenfels R', 'Riemann D', 'Seliger B']","['Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.

METHODS: We examined the relation between lifestyle and dietary risk factors for CML in 493,188 participants (294,271 males and 198,917 females) aged 50 to 71 years who completed a baseline questionnaire in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study in 1995 to 1996. Over a median of 10.5 years of follow-up, 178 incident cases of CML (139 males and 39 females) were ascertained from state registries. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for exposures of interest, adjusting for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis of all participants combined, female sex, years of education, and vigorous physical activity (HR for >/=3 times/week vs. <1 time/week 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49-0.99) were inversely associated with risk of CML, whereas smoking intensity (HR for smokers of >/=20 cigarettes per day vs. never smokers: 1.53; 95% CI, 1.03-2.27) and body mass (HR for BMI >/= 30 vs. <25 kg/m(2) 1.46; 95% CI, 0.95-2.23) were associated with increased risk. A range of dietary factors was not associated with disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the sparse information about lifestyle factors, which affect the risk of CML in the general population. IMPACT: If these findings are confirmed, it would suggest that CML may be amenable to preventive strategies.","['Kabat, Geoffrey C', 'Wu, Jennifer W', 'Moore, Steven C', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Park, Yikyung', 'Hollenbeck, Albert R', 'Rohan, Thomas E']","['Kabat GC', 'Wu JW', 'Moore SC', 'Morton LM', 'Park Y', 'Hollenbeck AR', 'Rohan TE']","['Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.

There are few reports in the literature of non-surgical management of ON. Patients with chemotherapy related ON, treated with zoledronic acid (ZA) were analyzed for clinical and radiological outcome. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. Serial joint radiographs were performed to assess response and graded according to Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) system. All patients were evaluated for bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD) at set intervals. RESULTS: Twenty children with ON were treated with ZA for median duration of 13 months (range 5-25) with median number of doses being 6 (2, 8). Five (25%) patients were pain free at the end of treatment and had minimal joint destruction on X-ray (ARCO score II); 5 (25%) underwent arthroplasty due to severe joint destruction and pain limiting activity (ARCO score III/IV); 10 (50%) reported ongoing pain with activity, none on regular analgesia. BMD analysis showed increase in lumbosacral BMD after 1 year of treatment. Compared to patients with ON of the knees, majority of patients with ON of the hips had radiological progression. CONCLUSION: ZA was well tolerated and improved joint pain in the majority of patients. Despite treatment with ZA, most patients with ON of hips had progressive joint destruction requiring arthroplasty. Patients with ON of the knees appeared to have radiological stabilization. Novel treatment strategies should be considered to prevent this debilitating complication in survivors of childhood cancer.","['Padhye, Bhavna', 'Dalla-Pozza, Luciano', 'Little, David G', 'Munns, Craig F']","['Padhye B', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'Little DG', 'Munns CF']","[""Department of Oncology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia. bhavna.padhye@health.nsw.gov.au""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130426,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arthralgia/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/therapy', 'Arthroplasty', 'Bone Density/drug effects', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Diphosphonates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Zoledronic Acid']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24563 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Sep;60(9):1539-45. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24563.

An anti-inflammatory, cardio-protective role for BNP was proposed. In cardiovascular diseases including pressure overload-induced HF, perivascular inflammation and cardiac fibrosis are, in part, mediated by monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)1-driven monocyte migration. We aimed to determine the role of BNP in monocyte motility to MCP1. A functional BNP receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPRA) was identified in human monocytes. BNP treatment inhibited MCP1-induced THP1 (monocytic leukemia cells) and primary monocyte chemotaxis (70 and 50 %, respectively). BNP did not interfere with MCP1 receptor expression or with calcium. BNP inhibited activation of the cytoskeletal protein RhoA in MCP1-stimulated THP1 (70 %). Finally, BNP failed to inhibit MCP1-directed motility of monocytes from patients with hypertension (n = 10) and HF (n = 6) suggesting attenuation of this anti-inflammatory mechanism in chronic heart disease. We provide novel evidence for a direct role of BNP/NPRA in opposing human monocyte migration and support a role for BNP as a cardio-protective hormone up-regulated as part of an adaptive compensatory response to combat excess inflammation.","['Glezeva, Nadezhda', 'Collier, Patrick', 'Voon, Victor', 'Ledwidge, Mark', 'McDonald, Kenneth', 'Watson, Chris', 'Baugh, John']","['Glezeva N', 'Collier P', 'Voon V', 'Ledwidge M', 'McDonald K', 'Watson C', 'Baugh J']","['School of Medicine and Medical Science, UCD Conway Institute for Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130427,United States,J Cardiovasc Transl Res,Journal of cardiovascular translational research,101468585,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL2/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Atrial Natriuretic Factor/agonists/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/02/15 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12265-013-9456-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2013 Aug;6(4):545-57. doi: 10.1007/s12265-013-9456-1.

Nonetheless, differences in survival persist between age groups. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to assess 5-year overall survival (OS) in various patient age groups. METHODS: Patients who had a diagnosis of CML were identified using the SEER 19 registries database. Patients who were included had SEER diagnosis codes for CML not otherwise specified (code 9863) and BCR/ABL-positive CML (code 9875) diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2005. Patients were divided into cohorts based on age at diagnosis: ages 15 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 to 84 years. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was used to estimate predictors of patient survival. RESULTS: In total, 5138 patients with a new CML diagnosis were identified. Five-year OS improved for all patients between the years 2000 and 2005. Compared with patients who were diagnosed in 2000, 5-year survival improved among patients ages 15 to 44 years (hazard ratio [HR] for mortality, 0.424; P < .0001), ages 45 to 64 years (HR, 0.716; P = .0315), and ages 65 to 74 years (HR, 0.692; P = .0126); and patients ages 75 to 84 years had an increased 5-year OS rate from 19.2% in 2000 to 36.4% in 2005 (HR, 0.568; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: OS at 5 years improved among all patients, including those ages 75 to 84 years, a group with historically poor outcomes. However, older age retained an association with worse survival, suggesting opportunities for further progress.","['Brunner, Andrew M', 'Campigotto, Federico', 'Sadrzadeh, Hossein', 'Drapkin, Benjamin J', 'Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Fathi, Amir T']","['Brunner AM', 'Campigotto F', 'Sadrzadeh H', 'Drapkin BJ', 'Chen YB', 'Neuberg DS', 'Fathi AT']","['Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130426,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28106 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Jul 15;119(14):2620-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28106.

The treatment approaches are often varied and controversial. The duration of first remission, site of relapse, immunophenotypic and molecular characteristics of relapsed disease and response to therapy influence treatment outcome. There are three main therapeutic options i.e., chemotherapy alone, induction chemotherapy followed by HLA matched allogeneic transplant and palliation. These may be chosen based on the above mentioned factors. The response to therapy may be evaluated morphologically or by minimal residual disease (MRD). Persistence of MRD, as assessed by molecular techniques or through flowcytometry, clearly influences prognosis in children with relapsed ALL. It not only helps in identifying the subset of patients likely to benefit from allogeneic bone marrow transplant (ABMT) but also in determining the timing of transplant. Patients with non-T phenotype, with late relapsing disease and good response to re-induction therapy have been shown to do equally well with chemotherapy alone.

In analogy to what has been observed with other nucleoside analogues such as cladribine and fludarabine, we document the first case of an Epstein-Barr virus-positive, iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated, lymphoproliferative disease, formally resembling polymorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in a patient treated with azacitidine (Vidaza) for chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). A 78-year-old female patient was diagnosed with CMML in January 2012, and treatment with azacitidine was initiated, which lasted for five cycles from February until June 2012. The patient was hospitalized in June 2012 under the suspicion of pneumonia. Transformation of the CMML was suspected at that time too. During hospitalization, a generalized enlargement of the lymph nodes and the spleen was noticed. The patient rapidly deteriorated and finally died of respiratory insufficiency. At autopsy, an Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder, resembling polymorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease with involvement of the lymph nodes, the spleen and the lung and causing necrotizing pneumonia, was diagnosed. Diagnostic criteria for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or infectious mononucleosis-like lymphoproliferative disease were not met. This is the first documented case of an azacitidine-associated lymphoproliferative disease, raising awareness for possible not yet known side effects of this drug, which should be kept in mind by oncologists and pathologists.","['Menter, T', 'Schlageter, M', 'Bastian, L', 'Haberthur, R', 'Ratz Bravo, A E', 'Tzankov, A']","['Menter T', 'Schlageter M', 'Bastian L', 'Haberthur R', 'Ratz Bravo AE', 'Tzankov A']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130429,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Component Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iatrogenic Disease', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/chemically induced/*etiology/pathology/virology', 'Necrosis', 'Pneumonia/etiology/pathology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/analysis']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/04/26 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2054 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2014 Mar;32(1):47-51. doi: 10.1002/hon.2054.

Yet, hematologic toxicity and fluid retention demand a dose modification or treatment discontinuation in selected patients. Patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib were retrospectively evaluated based on the toxicity-guided administration of a dose-reduced dasatinib regimen. Patients were treated with an on/off regimen (3 to 5 days on, 2 to 4 days off) to allow regression of dasatinib-dependent off-target toxicity. Patients were followed up by routine hematologic and cytogenetic assessment and molecular monitoring to safeguard clinical response to the altered drug schedule. Thirty-three CML patients primarily in chronic phase with imatinib intolerance (n = 11) or resistance (n = 22) were investigated. Nonexclusive reasons for dose reduction were hematologic toxicity (17/33, 51%) and pleural effusions (18/33, 55%). On/off treatment with a weekend drug holiday significantly reduced pleural effusions and hematologic toxicity. Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed effective disease control despite reduced total weekly dasatinib doses, either demonstrated by achieving an improved response level (12/31) or keeping the response level achieved by conventional continuous dosing (6/31). Of note, 10/12 patients with subsequently improved response have been treated for a minimum of 6 months with continuous dosing dasatinib regimens without having achieved the response level achieved after allowing drug holiday. Weekend treatment interruption of dasatinib allows continuation of dasatinib treatment for patients suffering from side effects. These data mandate prospective investigation of alternative intermittent targeting regimens.","['La Rosee, Paul', 'Martiat, Philippe', 'Leitner, Armin', 'Klag, Thomas', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Schenk, Thomas', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['La Rosee P', 'Martiat P', 'Leitner A', 'Klag T', 'Muller MC', 'Erben P', 'Schenk T', 'Saussele S', 'Hochhaus A']","['Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07740 Jena, Germany. paul.larosee@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130428,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1769-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Oct;92(10):1345-50. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1769-2.

However, models of myeloid leukemia rarely reproduce the human disease in full, due to genetic complexity or to difficulties in targeting leukemia initiating cells. Here, we used a zebrafish genetic model to induce the expression of oncogenic RAS in endothelial cells, including the hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta that generates hematopoietic cells, and observed the development of a myelo-erythroid proliferative disorder. In larvae, the phenotype is characterized by disruption of the vascular system and prominent expansion of the caudal hematopoietic tissue. In few surviving juveniles, increased number of immature hematopoietic cells and arrest of myeloid maturation was found in kidney marrow. Peripheral blood showed increased erythroblasts and myeloid progenitors. We found that the abnormal phenotype is associated with a downregulation of the Notch pathway, whereas overexpressing an activated form of Notch together with the oncogene prevents the expansion of the myelo-erythroid compartment. This study identifies the downregulation of the Notch pathway following an oncogenic event in the hemogenic endothelium as an important step in the pathogenesis of myelo-erythroid disorders and describes a number of potential effectors of this transformation.","['Alghisi, E', 'Distel, M', 'Malagola, M', 'Anelli, V', 'Santoriello, C', 'Herwig, L', 'Krudewig, A', 'Henkel, C V', 'Russo, D', 'Mione, M C']","['Alghisi E', 'Distel M', 'Malagola M', 'Anelli V', 'Santoriello C', 'Herwig L', 'Krudewig A', 'Henkel CV', 'Russo D', 'Mione MC']","['1] Chair of Hematology and Unit of Blood Disease and Stem Cell Transplantation Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia Medical School, Brescia, Italy [2] Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130429,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism/*pathology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Zebrafish/genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013132 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Nov;27(11):2229-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.132.

ZC3H15 was expressed ubiquitously in all human tissues tested by northern blotting and showed mainly a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution by immune fluorescence microscopy and western blotting of subcellular protein fractions. The expression of ZC3H15 was downregulated effectively in HeLa cells to </=13% of the control by transfection of specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Subsequent Affymetrix microarray analysis revealed 202 differentially expressed genes including 114 induced (>/=3-fold) genes and 88 suppressed (</=0.3-fold) genes. The gene ontology (GO) categories containing an over-representation of differentially expressed genes comprised cell growth, transcription, cell adhesion, regulation of NF-kappaB, regulation of MAPK, cell cycle arrest and immune response. ZC3H15 interacted with the signaling adapter protein tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF-2) as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. ZC3H15 expression was found to be significantly increased in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples compared to MDS, CML, ALL and normal bone marrow samples using the Leukemia Gene Atlas (LGA) database.

We found that administration of IL-15 significantly increases the numbers of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells in spleen and BM after transplantion without GVHD. Graft-versus-tumor (GVT) potency of the graft was evaluated upon tumor challenge using P815 tumor cells (H2(d)). IL-15 administration without T-cell infusion did not result in any survival improvement. However, IL-15 in combination with very low-dose T-cell infusion (1 x 10(4)) significantly increased GVT activity and improved survival in recipients of HI hematopoietic SCT (HSCT). This effect was observed when IL-15 was given at a later time point, rather than immediately following transplantation. IL-15 administration also specifically increased slow-proliferative CD8+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion in CD8+ T cells in recipients of CFSE (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester)-labeled HI T-cell infusion, whereas there was no effect on CD4+ T-cell proliferation, suggesting the critical effect of IL-15 on CD8+ T-cell homeostasis in HI host. We conclude that IL-15 can be used for enhancing antileukemia effect of HI-HSCT, which requires presence of donor-derived T cells.","['Sauter, C T', 'Bailey, C P', 'Panis, M M', 'Biswas, C S', 'Budak-Alpdogan, T', 'Durham, A', 'Flomenberg, N', 'Alpdogan, O']","['Sauter CT', 'Bailey CP', 'Panis MM', 'Biswas CS', 'Budak-Alpdogan T', 'Durham A', 'Flomenberg N', 'Alpdogan O']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130429,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-15/*administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mastocytoma/immunology/surgery/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Animal', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201347 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2013.47 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 Sep;48(9):1237-42. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2013.47.

Monocytic MLL-AF9 expressing cells (MM6, THP-1) were hypersensitive to both small-molecule inhibitors targeting Rac1 (EHT 1864, NSC 23766) (IC50EHT ~12.5 muM) and lipid lowering drugs (lovastatin, atorvastatin) (IC50Lova ~7.5 muM) as compared to acute myelocytic leukemia (NOMO-1, HL60) and T cell leukemia (Jurkat) cells (IC50EHT >30 muM; IC50Lova >25 muM). Hypersensitivity of monocytic cells following Rac1 inhibition resulted from caspase-driven apoptosis as shown by profound activation of caspase-8,-9,-7,-3 and substantial (~90 %) decrease in protein expression of pro-survival factors (survivin, XIAP, p-Akt). Apoptotic death was preceded by S139-posphorylation of histone H2AX (gammaH2AX), a prototypical surrogate marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Taken together, abrogation of Rac1 signaling causes DSBs in acute monocytic leukemia cells harbouring the MLL-AF9 oncogene, which, together with downregulation of survivin, XIAP and p-Akt, results in massive induction of caspase-driven apoptotic death. Apparently, Rac1 signaling is required for maintaining genetic stability and maintaining survival in specific subtypes of AML. Hence, targeting of Rac1 is considered a promising novel strategy to induce lethality in MLL-AF9 expressing AML.","['Hinterleitner, C', 'Huelsenbeck, J', 'Henninger, C', 'Wartlick, F', 'Schorr, A', 'Kaina, B', 'Fritz, G']","['Hinterleitner C', 'Huelsenbeck J', 'Henninger C', 'Wartlick F', 'Schorr A', 'Kaina B', 'Fritz G']","['Institute of Toxicology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Str 67, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0842-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Aug;18(8):963-79. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0842-6.,8,,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Folate receptors also play a role in the uptake of antifolate drugs which are used for therapeutic intervention in leukemia. Therefore, it is important to identify compounds which regulate expression of folate receptors in leukemic cells. The present study examined if curcumin could modulate the uptake and cytotoxicity of the antifolate drug methotrexate, in KG-1 leukemic cells. This is the first report to show that curcumin (10-50 muM) causes a significant, dose-dependent, 2-3 fold increase in uptake of radiolabelled folic acid and methotrexate into KG-1 cells both at 24 h and 48 h of treatment. Interestingly, pre-treatment of KG-1 leukemic cells with curcumin (10 muM and 25 muM) also caused a statistically significant enhancement in the cytotoxicity of methotrexate. We performed Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR to confirm the upregulation of FRbeta mRNA in curcumin treated cells. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting showed that curcumin caused increased expression of folate receptor betain KG-1 cells. Our data show that the mechanism of curcumin action involves up-regulation of folate receptor beta mRNA and protein in KG-1 cells. Therefore, combination of non-toxic concentrations of curcumin and methotrexate, may be a viable strategy for therapeutic intervention for leukemias using a folate receptor-targeted drug delivery system.","['Dhanasekaran, Sugapriya', 'Biswal, Bijesh K', 'Sumantran, Venil N', 'Verma, Rama S']","['Dhanasekaran S', 'Biswal BK', 'Sumantran VN', 'Verma RS']","['Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, TN, India. sughaphd@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130423,France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Folate Receptor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/01/29 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0300-9084(13)00108-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2013.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2013 Aug;95(8):1567-73. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2013.04.004.

Dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement may occur as a result of mutations or functional inhibition of complement-regulating proteins. Functional inhibition of the complement-regulating proteins may result from a monoclonal gammopathy. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 32 Mayo Clinic patients with C3 GN, 10 (31%) of whom had evidence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin in serum. OUTCOMES: Clinical features, hematologic and bone marrow biopsy findings, kidney biopsy findings, kidney measures, complement pathway abnormalities, treatment, and follow-up of patients with C3 GN that was associated with a monoclonal gammopathy. RESULTS: Mean age of patients with C3 GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy was 54.5 years. Bone marrow biopsy done in 9 patients revealed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance in 5 patients, small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia in one patient, and no abnormal clones in the other 3 patients. Kidney biopsy showed membranoproliferative GN with bright capillary wall C3 staining in all 10 patients. Evaluation of the alternative pathway of complement showed abnormalities in 7 of 9 patients tested. No mutation in complement-regulating proteins was detected in any patient. As an index case, one patient with C3 GN and chronic lymphocytic leukemia was treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone, and one patient with C3 GN and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance was treated with dexamethasone and bortezomib. Both patients showed significant decreases in hematuria and proteinuria and stabilization of kidney function. LIMITATIONS: Studies to show evidence of direct activation of the alternative pathway by monoclonal immunoglobulin were not done. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the association of C3 GN and monoclonal gammopathy, in particular in the older population, and the importance of targeting the underlying hematologic malignancy as an approach to treating C3 GN.","['Zand, Ladan', 'Kattah, Andrea', 'Fervenza, Fernando C', 'Smith, Richard J H', 'Nasr, Samih H', 'Zhang, Yuzhou', 'Vrana, Julie A', 'Leung, Nelson', 'Cornell, Lynn D', 'Sethi, Sanjeev']","['Zand L', 'Kattah A', 'Fervenza FC', 'Smith RJ', 'Nasr SH', 'Zhang Y', 'Vrana JA', 'Leung N', 'Cornell LD', 'Sethi S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130426,United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Complement C3/genetics/*urine', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glomerulonephritis/*diagnosis/genetics/*urine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraproteinemias/*diagnosis/genetics/*urine', 'Young Adult']",PMC4435575,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0272-6386(13)00591-X [pii]', '10.1053/j.ajkd.2013.02.370 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 2013 Sep;62(3):506-14. doi: 10.1053/j.ajkd.2013.02.370.

The approach was employed successfully in models of autoimmunity and organ transplantation. Recently, we demonstrated that molecular chimerism induces robust and lasting tolerance towards the major grass pollen allergen Phl p 5. Since allergens are a group of antigens differing widely in their function, origin and structure we further examined the effectiveness of molecular chimerism using the Phl p 5-unrelated major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, co-expressed with the reporter GFP. Besides, inhibition of CD26 was used to promote engraftment of modified stem cells. Retrovirus VSV-Betv1-GFP was generated to transduce 5-FU-mobilized BALB/c hematopoietic cells to express membrane-bound Bet v 1 (VSV-GFP virus was used as control). Myeloablated BALB/c mice received Betv1-GFP or GFP expressing bone marrow cells, pre-treated with a CD26 inhibitor. Chimerism was followed by flow cytometry. Tolerance was assessed by measuring allergen-specific isotype levels in sera, RBL assays and T-cell proliferation assays. Mice transplanted with transduced BMC developed multi-lineage molecular chimerism which remained stable long-term (>8 months). After repeated immunizations with Bet v 1 and Phl p 5 serum levels of Bet v 1-specific antibodies (IgE, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG3 and IgA) remained undetectable in Betv1-GFP chimeras while high levels of Phl p 5-specific antibodies developed. Likewise, basophil degranulation was induced in response to Phl p 5 but not to Bet v 1 and specific non-responsiveness to Bet v 1 was observed in proliferation assays. These data demonstrate successful tolerization towards Bet v 1 by molecular chimerism. Stable long-term chimerism was achieved under inhibition of CD26. These results provide evidence for the broad applicability of molecular chimerism as tolerance strategy in allergy.","['Gattringer, Martina', 'Baranyi, Ulrike', 'Pilat, Nina', 'Hock, Karin', 'Klaus, Christoph', 'Buchberger, Elisabeth', 'Ramsey, Haley', 'Iacomini, John', 'Valenta, Rudolf', 'Wekerle, Thomas']","['Gattringer M', 'Baranyi U', 'Pilat N', 'Hock K', 'Klaus C', 'Buchberger E', 'Ramsey H', 'Iacomini J', 'Valenta R', 'Wekerle T']","['Division of Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130330,Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Plant/genetics/*immunology', 'Basophils/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/metabolism', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Humoral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Protein Engineering', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', 'Transplantation Tolerance/*immunology']",PMC6624140,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/02/20 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-2985(13)00058-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2013.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2013 Sep;218(9):1139-46. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2013.03.007.

HTLV-1 encodes transactivator protein Tax that interacts with various cellular factors to modulate transcription and other biological functions. Additional cellular mediators of Tax-mediated transcriptional activation of HTLV-1 long terminal repeats (LTR) remain to be identified and characterized. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of group I p21-activated kinases (Paks) in Tax-induced LTR activation. Both wild-type and kinase-dead mutants of Pak3 were capable of potentiating the activity of Tax to activate LTR transcription. The effect of Paks on the LTR was attributed to the N-terminal regulatory domain and required the action of CREB, CREB-regulating transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) and p300/CREB-binding protein. Paks physically associated with Tax and CRTCs. Paks were recruited to the LTR in the presence of Tax. siRNAs against either Pak1 or Pak3 prevented the interaction of Tax with CRTC1 and the recruitment of Tax to the LTR. These siRNAs also inhibited LTR-dependent transcription in HTLV-1-transformed MT4 cells and in cells transfected with an infectious clone of HTLV-1. CONCLUSION: Group I Paks augment Tax-mediated transcriptional activation of HTLV-1 LTR in a kinase-independent manner.","['Chan, Ching-Ping', 'Siu, Yeung-Tung', 'Kok, Kin-Hang', 'Ching, Yick-Pang', 'Tang, Hei-Man Vincent', 'Jin, Dong-Yan']","['Chan CP', 'Siu YT', 'Kok KH', 'Ching YP', 'Tang HM', 'Jin DY']","['Department of Biochemistry, The University of Hong Kong, 3/F Laboratory Block, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130426,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcriptional Activation', '*Virus Replication', 'p21-Activated Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC3651266,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-47 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-47 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Apr 26;10:47. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-47.,,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using ALL-type treatment regimen to treat children with LBL was an important development in the treatment of LBL. During the last decades, several systematic clinical trials contributed to the controlled optimization of treatment. Today event-free survival (EFS) can be achieved for 75-90% of patients. However, acute and long-term toxicity, the lack of prognostic parameters and the poor outcome for patients who suffer from refractory or relapsed LBL remain highly relevant subjects for improvement.

Adenovirus infections in lower respiratory tract can be presented as bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of adenoviruses as the etiologic agent of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children by cell culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) test. The results of the laboratory tests were evaluated in the light of patients' clinical findings. The study consisted of 206 patients aged between 0-5 years old and who were admitted to the hospital with the complaints of LRTI between January 2011 and April 2012. The clinical, radiological and laboratory findings of the patients were recorded. Nasopharyngeal specimens were taken with flocked swab from all patients and adenoviruses were investigated by shell-vial cell culture, real-time PCR and DFA test, simultaneously. Of all the samples 89.3% were taken in January, February and March and 38% of the patients have one or more chronic underlying diseases as chromosomal abnormalities, congenital heart disease, heart failure, asthma, cystic fibrosis, leukemia, kidney failure and prematurity. Adenovirus was detected in 12 (5.8%) of the samples by PCR, seven (3.4%) of the samples by cell culture method. While seven samples were found positive with both PCR and cell culture, 194 samples yielded negative results in both tests. Five samples, which were found positive by PCR, were not grown in cell culture method. Twelve of the 153 samples examined with DFA test, could not be evaluated due to insufficient amount of cells, however 2.8% (4/141) of the samples were found positive for adenovirus antigens by DFA method. Those samples were also positive ones in the other two methods. Compared with cell culture, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of PCR were 100%, 97.5%, 58.3% and 100%, respectively; those values were 57%,100%,100% and 97.7%, respectively for DFA testing. Compared to PCR the sensitivity of cell culture is very low (16.6%) after three days of incubation, however, it increased to 58.3% after five days' of incubation. There was no significant relationship between adenovirus positivity and the presence of chronic diseases, the radiological findings and the laboratory findings. Of all adenovirus positive samples 83.3% were obtained in January, February and March. Our data indicated that the etiological agent was adenovirus in approximately 6% of children with LRTI. The most important step for the isolation of adenovirus from respiratory tract, is high quality and sufficient amounts of sample. The flexible flocked swabs made it easy to take nasopharyngeal swab from children. Although cell culture is still the gold standard for the diagnosis of adenovirus infections, PCR which is a fast method with high sensitivity and specificity can also be used. However, specific care should be taken during the DNA extraction stage, since the amount of the nucleic acid in the sample is critical for the best results. Even though the low sensitivity of DFA restricts its use in routine diagnosis of adenovirus infections, it should always be kept in mind that the quality of the clinical samples is most reliably evaluated by this method.","['Saglik, Imran', 'Mutlu, Derya', 'Ongut, Gozde', 'Velipasaoglu Guney, Sevtap', 'Ozkul, Aykut', 'Ogunc, Dilara', 'Colak, Dilek']","['Saglik I', 'Mutlu D', 'Ongut G', 'Velipasaoglu Guney S', 'Ozkul A', 'Ogunc D', 'Colak D']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.']",['tur'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,IM,"['Adenovirus Infections, Human/*virology', 'Adenoviruses, Human/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Bronchiolitis/virology', 'Bronchitis/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pneumonia, Viral/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*virology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/01/28 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5578/mb.4773 [doi]'],ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2013 Apr;47(2):282-94. doi: 10.5578/mb.4773.,2,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alt solunum yolu enfeksiyonu olan cocuklarda adenoviruslarin arastirilmasi,

Meanwhile, transfusion-associated GVHD (TA-GVHD) can be fatal. Recent advancements in immune cellular therapy are being adopted in clinical practice, although many concerns including TA-GVHD remain. This report describes a 64-year-old male non-HSCT candidate diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia who had received decitabine followed by an infusion of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor-primed peripheral blood stem cells (G-PBSCs) from his daughter, who carried haploidentical human leukocyte antigen. The patient developed aGVHD on the 20th day after infusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a single case report of a non-HSCT candidate who developed skin aGVHD with mild clinical course after decitabine and G-PBSCs combination. The clinical course, chimerism, and aGVHD pathology studies are detailed. RESULTS: Compared with conventional aGVHD in allo-HSCT recipients and TA-aGVHD, the presentation of this case followed a self-limited clinical course without marrow aplasia or severe progression. However, the patient eventually died of leukemia without a significant graft-versus-leukemia effect. CONCLUSION: First, the results demonstrate the existence of aGVHD in elderly non-HSCT candidates receiving adoptive cellular immune therapy. Second, aGVHD occurring under these conditions is probably a unique entity of aGVHD compared to TA-aGVHD and the conventional pattern in allo-HSCT recipients with respect to clinical course and prognosis.","['Yuan, Lei', 'Sun, Lu', 'Yang, Lin', 'Jing, Yu']","['Yuan L', 'Sun L', 'Yang L', 'Jing Y']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China; Department of Pathology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China; The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130429,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Decitabine', 'Graft vs Host Disease/classification/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/03/08 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/trf.12215 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2014 Jan;54(1):190-3. doi: 10.1111/trf.12215.

Quantifying the DR4/DR5 expression status on leukemia cell surfaces is of vital importance to the development of diagnostic tools to guide death receptor-based leukemia treatment. Taking the full advantages of novel nanobiotechnology, we have developed a robust electrochemical cytosensing approach toward ultrasensitive detection of leukemia cells with detection limit as low as ~40 cells and quantitative evaluation of DR4/DR5 expression on leukemia cell surfaces. The optimization of electron transfer and cell capture processes at specifically tailored nanobiointerfaces and the incorporation of multiple functions into rationally designed nanoprobes provide unique opportunities of integrating high specificity and signal amplification on one electrochemical cytosensor. The high sensitivity and selectivity of this electrochemical cytosensing approach also allows us to evaluate the dynamic alteration of DR4/DR5 expression on the surfaces of living cells in response to drug treatments. Using the TRAIL-resistant HL-60 cells and TRAIL-sensitive Jurkat cells as model cells, we have further verified that the TRAIL susceptibility of various types of leukemia cells is directly correlated to the surface expression levels of DR4/DR5. This versatile electrochemical cytosensing platform is believed to be of great clinical value for the early diagnosis of human leukemia and the evaluation of therapeutic effects on leukemia patients after radiation therapy or drug treatment.","['Zheng, Tingting', 'Fu, Jia-Ju', 'Hu, Lihui', 'Qiu, Fan', 'Hu, Minjin', 'Zhu, Jun-Jie', 'Hua, Zi-Chun', 'Wang, Hui']","['Zheng T', 'Fu JJ', 'Hu L', 'Qiu F', 'Hu M', 'Zhu JJ', 'Hua ZC', 'Wang H']","['State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130514,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Biosensing Techniques/*methods', 'Carbon/chemistry', 'Electrochemical Techniques/*methods', 'Electrodes', 'Ferric Compounds/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Melatonin/pharmacology', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Nitrogen/chemistry', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Death Domain/immunology/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac400994p [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2013 Jun 4;85(11):5609-16. doi: 10.1021/ac400994p.

Stem cell transplantation (SCT) offers a potential cure for BMF or leukaemia, but incurs substantial risks. Little is known about factors influencing SCT decision making. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to explore factors influencing patients' with FA and family members' decision making about SCT. DESIGN: Using a mixed-methods exploratory design, we surveyed US and Canadian patients with FA and family members who were offered SCT. MAIN VARIABLES STUDIED: Closed-ended survey items measured respondents' beliefs about the necessity, risks and concerns regarding SCT; multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between these factors and the decision to undergo SCT. Open-ended survey items measured respondents' perceptions of factors important to the SCT decision; qualitative analysis was used to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: The decision to undergo SCT was significantly associated with greater perceived necessity (OR = 2.81, P = 0.004) and lower concern about harms of SCT (OR = 0.31, P = 0.03). Qualitative analysis revealed a perceived lack of choice among respondents regarding the use of SCT, which was related to physician influence and respondent concerns about patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, study results emphasize the importance of the delicate interplay between provider recommendation of a medical procedure and patient/parental perceptions and decision making. Findings can help providers understand the need to acknowledge family members' perceptions of SCT decision making and offer a comprehensive discussion of the necessity, risks, benefits and potential outcomes.","['Hutson, Sadie P', 'Han, Paul K J', 'Hamilton, Jada G', 'Rife, Sean C', 'Al-Rahawan, Mohamad M', 'Moser, Richard P', 'Duty, Seth P', 'Anand, Sheeba', 'Alter, Blanche P']","['Hutson SP', 'Han PK', 'Hamilton JG', 'Rife SC', 'Al-Rahawan MM', 'Moser RP', 'Duty SP', 'Anand S', 'Alter BP']","['College of Nursing, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA.', 'Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, ME, USA.', 'Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program, Center for Cancer Training, NCI, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria, Peoria, IL, USA.', 'Science of Research and Technology Branch, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, NCI, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'College of Nursing, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.', 'Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.', 'Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130429,England,Health Expect,Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,9815926,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Decision Making', 'Family/*psychology', 'Fanconi Anemia/*therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",PMC3766454,2013/04/30 06:00,2016/06/28 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/hex.12066 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Expect. 2015 Oct;18(5):929-41. doi: 10.1111/hex.12066.

However, few studies have focused on associations between PCP and cancer risk at the community level. OBJECTIVE: The present study was to explore the cancer risk for the community population living long-term in a PCP contaminated area. METHODS: All the cancer cases diagnosed in 2009- 2011 in Tongling City were collected. The cancer patients' residencies were geo-referenced in each district. The historical PCP usage for each district of Tongling was calculated as the PCP pollution index, which was further used to divide into PCP exposure categories. Standardized rate ratios (SRRs) of cancer incidence were applied to detect the cancer risk as exposure grade elevated. Correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between PCP pollution and cancer incidence. RESULTS: A total of 5,288 cancer cases (3,451 male and 1,837 female) were identified. PCP usage was correlated with the incidence of leukemia (r=0.88, P=0.002) for males, and with cancer of the esophagus for males (r=0.83, P=0.008) and females (r=0.71, P=0.020). Compared with the low exposure category, significant SRRs for total cancer sites was obtained for high PCP exposure category (SRR=1.61, 95%CI=1.59-1.62). Most SRR values of the cancer sites were significantly increased as exposure grade elevated and exposure time extended. CONCLUSION: The present study found that community residents living in the PCP contaminated area had increased risk of cancers.

The patients were treated on the basis of stratified risk as per the Thai national protocol. Data were compiled from the hospital records. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe relapse-free survival and the Cox proportional hazard model to investigate the associated factors. RESULTS: Of the 103 children recruited, 86 (83.5%) achieved complete remission. The total follow-up time was 3132.5 person-months. Eighteen (20.9%) relapsed.

On bivariate analysis, age, cancer type, and infectious complications (bacteremia/sepsis, hypotension, fungal infections, and pneumonia) were significantly associated with longer LOS and death. On multivariate analysis, acute leukemia and infectious complications were linked with longer LOS and death significantly. The median cost of hospitalized FN was THB 33,686 (USD 1,122) with the highest cost observed in acute leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: FN in adult patients results in significant mortality in hospitalized Thai patients. Factors associated with increased mortality include older age (>70), acute leukemia, comorbidity, and infectious complications.","['Chindaprasirt, Jarin', 'Wanitpongpun, Chinadol', 'Limpawattana, Panita', 'Thepsuthammarat, Kaewjai', 'Sripakdee, Warunsuda', 'Sookprasert, Aumkhae', 'Wirasorn, Kosin']","['Chindaprasirt J', 'Wanitpongpun C', 'Limpawattana P', 'Thepsuthammarat K', 'Sripakdee W', 'Sookprasert A', 'Wirasorn K']","['Division of Oncology, Internal Medicine Department, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. jarich@kku.ac.th']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/economics', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*economics/*mortality', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Humans', 'Hypotension/economics', 'Length of Stay/economics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/economics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Pneumonia/economics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thailand', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.2.1115 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(2):1115-9. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.2.1115.,2,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clofarabine is a second generation nucleoside analogue which has shown promising activity in elderly patients with AML. This study was conducted to review the outcome of treatment with clofarabine in a group of such patients. METHODS: The records of 5 elderly patients who were diagnosed to have AML and treated with clofarabine over a 12 month period were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 2 female and 3 male patients with a median age of 68 years (range 65-82). At the time of treatment, 2 patients had newly diagnosed AML not considered suitable for intensive therapy, while 3 patients had partial or no response to conventional chemotherapy. The overall response rate was 100%, all patients achieving a complete remission. Induction and consolidation were well tolerated. All patients developed neutropenia with a median duration of 20 days (range 17-42). One patient developed hand and foot syndrome and a generalized rash but recovered. There was no mortality and all patients remained in remission after a median follow-up of 5.2 months (Range 3-10). CONCLUSION: Clofarabine (alone or in combination) is active in elderly AML patients with an acceptable safety profile and should be considered a potential option in this group.","['Aleem, Aamer', 'Anjum, Farhan', 'Algahtani, Farjah', 'Iqbal, Zafar', 'Alsaleh, Khalid', 'Almomen, Abdulkareem']","['Aleem A', 'Anjum F', 'Algahtani F', 'Iqbal Z', 'Alsaleh K', 'Almomen A']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology /Oncology, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ameralem@ksu.edu.sa']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clofarabine', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hand-Foot Syndrome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.2.1089 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(2):1089-92. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.2.1089.,2,,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined they account for about 11 percent of cancers in Mazandaran province, ranking number 2 in prevalent cancers. The purpose of this study was to provide a first general and specific description of leukemia and lymphoma in Mazandaran province. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive retrospective study, entire patient's data were reviewed which had confirmed diagnosis of leukemia and lymphoma with valid laboratory or pathology reports in the period 2001-2008. The data were collected by Babol health research site related to Tehran University of Medical Science. Incidence rates based on age groups, gender, city of residence and type of malignancy were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: In Mazandaran province, 1,146 cases of leukemia and lymphoma were encountered, 5.9 in 100,000 persons on average annually. The highest incidence rates were obtained at age of 70 or above (26.4) and the lowest at age of 0-9 (2.3).The incidence rates in males and females were 7.1 and 4.8 respectively with a ratio of 1.5. The highest incidence rate was in Babol (7.3) and the lowest was calculated in Neka and Tonekabon equally (1.5). According to the type of malignancy, non Hodgkin lymphoma, with 2.5/100,000 have the most incidence rate and myeloid leukemia with 1.8 had the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained findings indicate clear differences in incidence rates based on age, gender, residence, and type of malignancy. Therefore it's suggested that in addition to promote data collecting programs, research projects should be programmed to define leukemia and lymphoma risk factors in this province.","['Tahmasby, Bahram', 'Marnani, Ahmad Barati', 'Maleki, Mohammadreza', 'Barouni, Mohsen', 'Mousavi, Seyyed Hamid', 'Naseriyan, Behjat', 'Nazarnezhad, Mirzaali', 'Alizadeh, Ali', 'Sabermahani, Asma']","['Tahmasby B', 'Marnani AB', 'Maleki M', 'Barouni M', 'Mousavi SH', 'Naseriyan B', 'Nazarnezhad M', 'Alizadeh A', 'Sabermahani A']","['School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.2.1053 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(2):1053-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.2.1053.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a subset of these patients, the FIP1L1/PDGFRA (F/P) oncoprotein is detectable. F/P exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and activates a number of signaling pathways. So far, however, little is known about the role of F/P-dependent proteins in the pathogenesis of CEL. METHODS: A screen for F/P-dependent cytokines was performed in growth factor-dependent human cell lines lentivirally transduced with F/P. Signal transduction pathways were characterized in Ba/F3 cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of F/P and in EOL-1 cells. Cytokine expression was confirmed in patients' material by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy. Gene expression analysis, proliferation assays, and chemotaxis assays were used to elucidate paracrine interactions between neoplastic eosinophils and stromal cells. RESULTS: We show that F/P upregulates expression of oncostatin M (OSM) in various cell line models in a STAT5-dependent manner. Correspondingly, neoplastic eosinophils in the bone marrow were found to overexpress OSM. OSM derived from F/P + cells stimulated proliferation of stromal cells. Moreover, OSM-containing supernatants from F/P + cells were found to upregulate production of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12 in human fibroblasts. SDF-1, in turn, induced migration of EOL-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a F/P-driven paracrine interaction between neoplastic eosinophils and stromal cells that may contribute to tissue fibrosis and accumulation of neoplastic eosinophils in CEL.","['Hoermann, G', 'Cerny-Reiterer, S', 'Sadovnik, I', 'Mullauer, L', 'Bilban, M', 'Groger, M', 'Horny, H-P', 'Reiter, A', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Valent, P', 'Mayerhofer, M']","['Hoermann G', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Sadovnik I', 'Mullauer L', 'Bilban M', 'Groger M', 'Horny HP', 'Reiter A', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Mannhalter C', 'Valent P', 'Mayerhofer M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130427,Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*metabolism']",,2013/04/30 06:00,2013/10/25 06:00,['2013/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/all.12139 [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 2013 Jun;68(6):713-23. doi: 10.1111/all.12139.

We analyzed the impact of such a response on outcomes among patients treated with 4 TKI modalities as frontline therapy in CML-CP. A total of 483 patients who received 400 or 800 mg imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib were analyzed. The median follow-up was 72 mo. Landmark analysis at 3 mo by molecular response showed that the cumulative proportions of 3-y event-free survival (EFS) for 3-mo BCR-ABL levels was 95% for those with </=1%, 98% for >1% to 10%, and 61% for those with >10% (P = .001). The corresponding values by cytogenetic responses were 97% if Ph+ = 0%, 89% if Ph+ = 1% to 35%, and 81% if Ph+ >35% (P = .001). Cytogenetic response at 3 mo significantly discriminated for 3-y overall survival (OS): 98%, 96%, and 92%, respectively (P = .01). In multivariate analysis, young patients, high Sokal index, and treatment with imatinib 400 significantly predicted for poor (>35%) cytogenetic response at 3 mo.

One may postulate that genomic driver lesions with effects on CLL cell proliferation, apoptosis thresholds, or chemotherapy resistance should increase in frequency over time when measured sequentially in a large CLL cohort. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We sequentially sampled a large well-characterized CLL cohort at a mean of 4 years between samplings and measured acquired copy number aberrations (aCNA) and LOH using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 6.0 array profiling and the mutational state of TP53, NOTCH1, and SF3B1 using Sanger sequencing. The paired analysis included 156 patients, of whom 114 remained untreated and 42 received intercurrent therapies, predominantly potent chemoimmunotherapy, during the sampling interval. RESULTS: We identify a strong effect of intercurrent therapies on the frequency of acquisition of aCNAs in CLL. Importantly, the spectrum of acquired genomic changes was largely similar in patients who did or did not receive intercurrent therapies; therefore, various genomic changes that become part of the dominant clones are often already present in CLL cell populations before therapy. Furthermore, we provide evidence that therapy of CLL with preexisting TP53 mutations results in outgrowth of genomically very complex clones, which dominate at relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Using complementary technologies directed at the detection of genomic events that are present in substantial proportions of the clinically relevant CLL disease bulk, we capture aspects of genomic evolution in CLL over time, including increases in the frequency of genomic complexity, specific recurrent aCNAs, and TP53 mutations.","['Ouillette, Peter', 'Saiya-Cork, Kamlai', 'Seymour, Erlene', 'Li, Cheng', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Ouillette P', 'Saiya-Cork K', 'Seymour E', 'Li C', 'Shedden K', 'Malek SN']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130425,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",PMC3674194,2013/04/27 06:00,2014/01/09 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-0138 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0138 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 1;19(11):2893-904. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0138.

However, the mechanisms of action of combination therapies are not completely understood. In the present study, a novel strategy for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was identified, in which the chemotherapeutic agent, homoharringtonine (HHT), was combined with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a panHDAC inhibitor. A synergistic effect was observed when HHT was added to SAHA to induce apoptosis in Kasumi1 and THP1 leukemia cells. This combination was found to significantly enhance the activation of caspase8 and 9 compared with treatment with each drug separately. Notably, while SAHA induced upregulation of death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5, HHT upregulated tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression in a dosedependent manner. In addition, the synergistic effect between HHT and SAHA was blocked partially using a specific antiTRAIL antibody. The combination therapy was also found to significantly inhibit the growth of leukemia xenografts in vivo with enhanced apoptosis. These results indicate that, by regulating the induction of TRAIL and activation of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway, it is possible to administer HHT at low concentrations in combination with SAHA as an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of AML.","['Cao, Hui', 'Cheng, Yizhi', 'You, Liangshun', 'Qian, Jiejing', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Cao H', 'Cheng Y', 'You L', 'Qian J', 'Qian W']","['Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zheijiang 310003, P.R.

Here, we show that promyelocytic leukaemia (PML, also known as TRIM19), involved in sensing DNA damage and executing homologous recombination repair, is down-regulated in non-tumour liver cells surrounding hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). No PML mutation or deletion was found in HBV-infected liver or HCC cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of liver biopsies from patients with breast or liver cancer and HBV reactivation after chemotherapy revealed PML up-regulation and HBV exacerbation in normal liver tissue in response to DNA damage (functional PML), PML down-regulation in HCC peritumour cells associated with high HBsAg accumulation and low HBV replication activity (suppressive PML), and heterogeneous nuclear PML expression in HCC cells that lost HBV DNA and HBsAg and were non-reactive to DNA damage (dysregulated PML). Loss of PML in HBsAg-transgenic mice promoted chromosome breaks in liver cells and accelerated the accumulation of body and liver fat and the development of a liver steatosis-dysplasia-adenoma-carcinoma sequence in an inflammation-independent and male-predominant manner, compared to PML knock-out or HBsAg-transgenic mice during the same time period. These results indicate that PML deficiency facilitates genomic instability and promotes HBsAg-related hepatocarcinogenesis, which also involves androgen and lipid metabolism. These findings uncover a novel PML link between HBV-related tumourigenesis, DNA repair, and metabolism.","['Chung, Yih-Lin', 'Wu, Mei-Ling']","['Chung YL', 'Wu ML']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Koo Foundation Sun-Yat-Sen Cancer Center, Taipei, 112, Taiwan. ylchung@kfsyscc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,IM,"['Adiposity', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Biopsy', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/chemically induced/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Diethylnitrosamine', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Fatty Liver/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Genomic Instability', 'Hepatitis B/*complications/diagnosis/genetics', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/blood/genetics', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/growth & development/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemically induced/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Activation', 'Virus Replication']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/09/14 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.4195 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2013 Aug;230(4):377-87. doi: 10.1002/path.4195.,4,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '3IQ78TTX1A (Diethylnitrosamine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

TL was an independent prognostic factor and subdivided patients with otherwise good-prognostic features (e.g., mutated IGHV genes, favorable cytogenetics) into subgroups with different outcome. Furthermore, in follow-up samples (n = 119) taken 5-8 years after diagnosis, TL correlated well with TL at diagnosis and remained unaffected by treatment.

We compared long-term outcomes of 60 consecutive RIC transplants (fludarabine plus melphalan) with 120 myeloablative conditioning (MAC) transplants (total body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide) for adult high-risk ALL in first or second complete remission. All transplants received a uniform strategy of pretransplant chemotherapy and GVHD prophylaxis. Compared to MAC transplants, RIC transplants had older age (46 years vs. 33 years, P < 0.001) and higher proportions of transplantation using peripheral blood (93.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.001) but otherwise showed similar characteristics. After a median follow-up of 67 months, RIC transplants showed comparable nonrelapse mortality (21.2% vs. 24.3%) and disease-free survival (50.8% vs. 54.9%) to MAC transplants, although relapse risk was higher (34.2% vs. 26.4%; HR, 2.07; P = 0.019) in multivariate analysis. Other independent factors associated with better outcomes were the presence of chronic GVHD and transplantation in first complete remission. Interestingly, the negative impact of RIC on relapse risk was seen only for Philadelphia-positive ALL transplants (32.7% vs. 19.6%; HR, 3.46; P = 0.020), while no difference was found between RIC and MAC for Philadelphia-negative ALL transplants (35.0% vs. 32.1%; HR, 1.39; P = 0.429). RIC can be considered as a reasonable choice for providing a sufficient long-term graft-versus-leukemia effect for adult high-risk ALL patients ineligible for MAC.","['Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Park, Chong-Won', 'Lee, Seok']","['Eom KS', 'Shin SH', 'Yoon JH', 'Yahng SA', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Min CK', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Park CW', 'Lee S']","['Department of Hematology, Catholic BMT Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea (South Korea).']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130530,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/prevention & control/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/methods']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23465 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Aug;88(8):634-41. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23465.

In patients with refractory or relapsed (R/R) AML, the prognosis is still poor and this group is targeted for new drug development. We reviewed the outcome of 47 patients, with R/R AML after at least one course of intensive chemotherapy, treated with 5-azacytidine in three different French institutions. The overall response rate was 38% including complete remission in 21%, partial remission in 11%, and hematological improvement in 6% of cases. Median time to relapse was 6 (range, 1-39) months. Median overall survival was 9 months (not reached by responders vs. 4.5 months for nonresponders patients, P = 0.0001). Univariate analysis identified the absence of peripheral blood blasts and <20% bone marrow blasts as prognostic factors for both overall response and survival, but not age, ECOG/PS, type of AML, cytogenetic, status of the disease, number of previous lines of therapy, previous hematological stem cell transplantation, or white blood cells count. Bone marrow blasts percentage <20% was the only independent prognostic factor identified by multivariate analysis for overall response (P = 0.0013) and survival (P = 0.0324). Six patients in remission could proceed to an allogenic hematological stem cell transplantation. The drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events were hematopoietic toxicities (38%) and infection (32%). In conclusion, this study suggests that a salvage therapy with 5-azacytidine is an interesting option for patients with R/R AML after intensive chemotherapy. Prospective randomized studies are needed to demonstrate a superiority of this approach over others strategies.","['Ivanoff, Sarah', 'Gruson, Berengere', 'Chantepie, Sylvain P', 'Lemasle, Emilie', 'Merlusca, Lavinia', 'Harrivel, Veronique', 'Charbonnier, Amandine', 'Votte, Patrick', 'Royer, Bruno', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre']","['Ivanoff S', 'Gruson B', 'Chantepie SP', 'Lemasle E', 'Merlusca L', 'Harrivel V', 'Charbonnier A', 'Votte P', 'Royer B', 'Marolleau JP']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Amiens, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20130530,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23464 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Jul;88(7):601-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23464.

We investigated associations of symptoms and consultation frequency in primary care with TYA cancers. METHODS: Population-based, case-control study was carried out using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). A total of 1064 TYA diagnosed with cancer were matched to 13,206 controls. Symptoms independently associated with specific cancers were identified. Likelihood ratios (LRs) and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated. RESULTS: In the 3 months before diagnosis, 397 (42.9%) cases consulted > or =4 times vs 593(11.5%) controls (odds ratio (OR): 12.1; 95% CI: 9.7, 15.1), yielding a PPV for any cancer of 0.018%. The LR of lymphoma with a head/neck mass was 434 (95% CI: 60, 3158), with a PPV of 0.5%. Corresponding figures in other cancers included - LR of leukaemia with lymphadenopathy (any site): 29 (95% CI: 8, 112), PPV 0.015%; LR of CNS tumour with seizure: 56 (95% CI: 19, 163), PPV 0.024%; and LR of sarcoma with lump/mass/swelling: 79 (95% CI: 24, 264), PPV 0.042%. CONCLUSION: Teenagers and young adults with cancer consulted more frequently than controls in the 3 months before diagnosis. Primary care features of cancer match secondary care reports, but were of very low risk; nonetheless, some features increased the likelihood of cancer substantially and should be taken seriously when assessing TYA.","['Dommett, R M', 'Redaniel, M T', 'Stevens, M C G', 'Hamilton, W', 'Martin, R M']","['Dommett RM', 'Redaniel MT', 'Stevens MC', 'Hamilton W', 'Martin RM']","['School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Level 6 UHB Education Centre, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol BS2 8AE, UK.

Increased body mass index (BMI) has been associated with a higher incidence of various malignancies, including AML. We sought to determine whether patient BMI at the time of AML diagnosis is related to overall survival (OS) among elderly patients. We identified 97 patients with AML diagnosed after the age of 60 and treated with cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy. The median age was 68 years (range 60-87); 52% of patients were male, and our study population was predominantly white (89% of patients). The median OS for all patients was 316 days (95% CI 246-459). The hazard ratio for mortality was increased among patients with a BMI < 25 compared to BMI >/= 30 (HR 2.14, P = 0.009, 95% CI 1.21-3.77), as well as with older age (HR 1.76, P = 0.015, 95% CI 1.12-2.79) and with secondary versus de novo disease (HR 1.95, P = 0.006, 95% CI 1.21-3.14). After multivariable analysis, we did not find a significant association between OS and other potential confounders such as coronary artery disease or diabetes among these patients. We conclude that increased BMI was independently associated with improved OS among older AML patients at our institution.","['Brunner, Andrew M', 'Sadrzadeh, Hossein', 'Feng, Yang', 'Drapkin, Benjamin J', 'Ballen, Karen K', 'Attar, Eyal C', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'McAfee, Steven L', 'Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Fathi, Amir T']","['Brunner AM', 'Sadrzadeh H', 'Feng Y', 'Drapkin BJ', 'Ballen KK', 'Attar EC', 'Amrein PC', 'McAfee SL', 'Chen YB', 'Neuberg DS', 'Fathi AT']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20130530,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', '*Body Mass Index', 'Coronary Artery Disease/mortality/therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Diabetes Mellitus/mortality/therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",PMC4214755,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23462 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Aug;88(8):642-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23462.

In particular, the B-cell receptor (BCR) and nuclear factor- kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways are activated in the lymph node (LN) microenvironment. Thus, model systems mimicking tumor-host interactions are important tools to study CLL biology and pathogenesis. We investigated whether the recently established NOD/scid/gammac(null) (NSG) mouse xenograft model can recapitulate the effects of the human microenvironment. We assessed, therefore, tumor characteristics previously defined in LN-resident CLL cells, including proliferation, and activation of the BCR and NF-kappaB pathways. We found that the murine spleen (SP) microenvironment supported CLL cell proliferation and activation to a similar degree than the human LN, including induction of BCR and NF-kappaB signaling in the xenografted cells. Next, we used this model to study ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development. Ibrutinib inhibited BCR and NF-kappaB signaling induced by the microenvironment, decreased proliferation, induced apoptosis and reduced the tumor burden in vivo. Thus, our data demonstrate that the SP of xenografted NSG mice can, in part, recapitulate the role of the human LN for CLL cells. In addition, we show that ibrutinib effectively disrupts tumor-host interactions essential for CLL cell proliferation and survival in vivo.","['Herman, S E M', 'Sun, X', 'McAuley, E M', 'Hsieh, M M', 'Pittaluga, S', 'Raffeld, M', 'Liu, D', 'Keyvanfar, K', 'Chapman, C M', 'Chen, J', 'Buggy, J J', 'Aue, G', 'Tisdale, J F', 'Perez-Galan, P', 'Wiestner, A']","['Herman SE', 'Sun X', 'McAuley EM', 'Hsieh MM', 'Pittaluga S', 'Raffeld M', 'Liu D', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Chapman CM', 'Chen J', 'Buggy JJ', 'Aue G', 'Tisdale JF', 'Perez-Galan P', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130426,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4126654,2013/04/27 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013131 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Dec;27(12):2311-21. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.131.

We studied 879 PMF patients to determine the individual and combinatorial prognostic relevance of somatic mutations. Analysis was performed in 483 European patients and the seminal observations were validated in 396 Mayo Clinic patients. Samples from the European cohort, collected at time of diagnosis, were analyzed for mutations in ASXL1, SRSF2, EZH2, TET2, DNMT3A, CBL, IDH1, IDH2, MPL and JAK2. Of these, ASXL1, SRSF2 and EZH2 mutations inter-independently predicted shortened survival. However, only ASXL1 mutations (HR: 2.02; P<0.001) remained significant in the context of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). These observations were validated in the Mayo Clinic cohort where mutation and survival analyses were performed from time of referral.

This hypothesis presumes that the disease is maintained by a rare population of leukemia-initiating stem cells which have acquired genetic or epigenetic changes. It is most likely that a single (epi)genetic event will not be sufficient to cause leukemia, but that a number of sequential events are required. Similar to normal hematopoietic stem cells, both intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors that arise from the bone marrow niche, provide essential cues that regulate cell fate decisions such as leukemic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. In this chapter, we will review the current understanding of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that underlie the process of leukemic transformation, and will discuss which events potentially co-operate to induce leukemia.","['van den Boom, Vincent', 'Horton, Sarah J', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['van den Boom V', 'Horton SJ', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Hematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 OXY, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Stem Cells,Journal of stem cells,101295936,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Epigenomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",,2012/01/01 00:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jsc.2012.7.3.155 [pii]', 'jsc.2012.7.3.155 [doi]']",ppublish,J Stem Cells. 2012;7(3):155-79. doi: jsc.2012.7.3.155.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to solid tumors, the mechanisms that regulate T cell activation versus tolerance to hematological malignancies have been underexplored. A murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model was used to investigate antigen-specific T cell responses against AML cells inoculated i.v. versus s.c. Robust antigen-specific T cell responses were generated against AML cells after s.c., but not i.v., inoculation. In fact, i.v. AML cell inoculation prevented functional T cell activation in response to subsequent s.c. AML cell challenge. T cell dysfunction was antigen specific and did not depend on Tregs or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Antigen-specific TCR-Tg CD8+ T cells proliferated, but failed to accumulate, and expressed low levels of effector cytokines in hosts after i.v. AML induction, consistent with abortive T cell activation and peripheral tolerance. Administration of agonistic anti-CD40 Ab to activate host APCs enhanced accumulation of functional T cells and prolonged survival. Our results suggest that antigen-specific T cell tolerance is a potent immune evasion mechanism in hosts with AML that can be reversed in vivo after CD40 engagement.","['Zhang, Long', 'Chen, Xiufen', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Kline, Douglas E', 'Teague, Ryan M', 'Gajewski, Thomas F', 'Kline, Justin']","['Zhang L', 'Chen X', 'Liu X', 'Kline DE', 'Teague RM', 'Gajewski TF', 'Kline J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130424,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immune Tolerance/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Time Factors']",PMC3635717,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['63980 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI63980 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2013 May;123(5):1999-2010. doi: 10.1172/JCI63980.

Although hypersensitivity reactions to PEG-ASP occur less frequently than with other formulations, they are not uncommon and have an adverse impact on patient outcomes. Intravenous (IV) administration of PEG-ASP reduces patient pain and anxiety and is being used with increasing frequency in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to compare the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to PEG-ASP in children when administered either by intramuscular (IM) or IV routes between January 2006 and May 2008. RESULTS: Of 68 patients studied, 7 experienced a hypersensitivity reaction (10.3%). Two of 16 patients (12.5%) who received only IV PEG-ASP and 3 of 27 patients (11.1%) exposed to only IM PEG-ASP experienced a hypersensitivity reaction. Severe reactions (grade 3 or 4) occurred only once after 119 total doses (0.8%) of IV PEG-ASP and once after 215 total doses (0.5%) of IM PEG-ASP (P=1.0). Thrombosis or pancreatitis were rare and were not increased after IV PEG-ASP administration. DISCUSSION: IV PEG-ASP is well tolerated and does not result in a significant increase in the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in children.","['August, Keith J', 'Miller, Weston P', 'Dalton, Amanda', 'Shinnick, Sara']","['August KJ', 'Miller WP', 'Dalton A', 'Shinnick S']","['*Childrens Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO daggerDivision of Blood and Marrow Transplantion, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN double daggerSigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Washingtonian Boulevard, Gaithersburg, MD.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31828e5471 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Oct;35(7):e283-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31828e5471.,7,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of coagulation derangement at the onset of VTEs was evaluated by a nested case-control study. RESULTS: Forty-eight (2.4%) children presented with a VTE. The rate of VTEs was higher in male patients (P=0.001); patients randomized to receive dexamethasone tended to have a higher rate of VTE compared with those who received prednisone (P=0.10). The coagulation derangement at the onset of VTE was not associated with VTE occurrence. The prevalence of a factor V Leiden G1691A mutation and the prothrombin G20210A variant was higher in children with VTE than that expected in the general population.","['Santoro, Nicola', 'Colombini, Antonella', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Grassi, Massimo', 'Giordano, Paola', 'Parasole, Rosanna', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Caruso, Roberta', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Rizzari, Carmelo']","['Santoro N', 'Colombini A', 'Silvestri D', 'Grassi M', 'Giordano P', 'Parasole R', 'Barisone E', 'Caruso R', 'Conter V', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Masera G', 'Rizzari C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ospedale Policlinico ""Consorziale,"" University of Bari, Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Venous Thromboembolism/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Venous Thrombosis/epidemiology/*etiology']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31828dc614 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jul;35(5):348-55. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31828dc614.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflammatory stimulation (IS) in the eye mediates neuroprotection and induces axon regeneration into the injured optic nerve. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been identified as key mediators of these effects. Here, we investigated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6), another member of the glycoprotein 130-activating cytokine family, as additional contributing factor. Expression of IL-6 was markedly induced in the retina upon optic nerve injury and IS, and mature RGCs expressed the IL-6 receptor. Treatment of cultured RGCs with IL-6 or specific IL-6 receptor agonist, significantly increased neurite outgrowth janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (JAK/STAT3) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) dependently. Moreover, IL-6 reduced myelin, but not neurocan-mediated growth inhibition mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dependently in cultured RGCs. In vivo, intravitreal application of IL-6 transformed RGCs into a regenerative state, enabling axon regeneration beyond the lesion site of the optic nerve. On the other hand, genetic ablation of IL-6 in mice significantly reduced IS-mediated myelin disinhibition and axon regeneration in the optic nerve. Therefore, IL-6 contributes to the beneficial effects of IS and its disinhibitory effect adds an important feature to the effects of so far identified IS-mediating factors. Consequently, application of IL-6 or activation of its receptor might provide suitable strategies for enhancing optic nerve regeneration.","['Leibinger, M', 'Muller, A', 'Gobrecht, P', 'Diekmann, H', 'Andreadaki, A', 'Fischer, D']","['Leibinger M', 'Muller A', 'Gobrecht P', 'Diekmann H', 'Andreadaki A', 'Fischer D']","['Department of Neurology, Heinrich-Heine-University of Dusseldorf, Merowingerplatz 1a, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130425,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Myelin Sheath/metabolism', 'Nerve Regeneration/*drug effects', 'Neurocan/*metabolism', 'Optic Nerve/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/agonists/metabolism', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",PMC3641349,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013126 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.126 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Apr 25;4:e609. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.126.,,,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Neurocan)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of YM155, a unique small-molecule inhibitor of survivin, in human myelogenous leukemia cells. YM155 potently inhibited the cell growth of HL-60 and U937 cells with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.3 nM and 0.8 nM, respectively. YM155 significantly suppressed the levels of mRNA expression and protein of survivin in HL-60 and U937 cells. In addition, we also found that YM155 down-regulated the level of Mcl-1, another critical anti-apoptotic protein, in both HL-60 and U937 cells. Treatment of HL-60 and U937 cells with YM155 induced apoptosis concomitant with the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Interestingly, we have found that caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK strongly inhibited YM155-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and U937 cells. When cells were pretreated with Z-IETD-FMK, the activation of caspase-3 was completely abolished, suggesting that caspase-8 may be involved in the activation of caspase-3 during YM155-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated for the first time that YM155 induces caspase-8 dependent apoptosis through downregulation of survivin and Mcl-1 in human leukemia cells.","['Feng, Weiying', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Feng W', 'Yoshida A', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Fukui, 23 Shimoaizuki, Matsuoka, Eiheiji-Chou, Fukui 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130422,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Naphthoquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin', 'U937 Cells']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)00662-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 May 24;435(1):52-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.036.

Mutations map to the C-terminal domain of the protein and cause its unfolding, loss of DNA binding properties and aberrant cellular localization. Here we investigate the folding pathway and denatured state properties of a NPM1 C-terminal domain construct encompassing the last 70 residues in the reference sequence. This construct is more stable than the previously characterized domain, which consisted of the last 53 residues. Data reveal that, similarly to what was discovered for the shorter construct, also the 70-residue construct of NPM1 displays a detectable residual structure in its denatured state. The higher stability of the latter domain allows us to conclude that the denatured state is robust to changes in solvent composition and that it consists of a discrete state in equilibrium with the expanded fully unfolded conformation. This observation, which might appear as a technicality, is in fact of general importance for the understanding of the folding of proteins. The implications of our results are discussed in the context of previous works on single domain helical proteins.","['Chiarella, Sara', 'Federici, Luca', 'Di Matteo, Adele', 'Brunori, Maurizio', 'Gianni, Stefano']","['Chiarella S', 'Federici L', 'Di Matteo A', 'Brunori M', 'Gianni S']","['Istituto Pasteur - Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti and Istituto di Biologia e Patologia Molecolari del CNR, Dipartimento di Scienze Biochimiche A.

DESIGN: Prospective, observational pilot study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a department of physical medicine and rehabilitation and research institute in an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with chronic (>1y from initial injury) SCI (n=22) and age- and sex-matched uninjured subjects (n=19). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma levels of MIF, as determined by a commercially available multiplex suspension immunoassay. The relationship between MIF levels and clinical/demographic variables was also examined. As a secondary outcome, we evaluated other cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. RESULTS: Plasma MIF levels were significantly higher in subjects with chronic SCI than in control subjects (P<.001). Elevated MIF levels were not correlated significantly with any one clinical or demographic characteristic. Subjects with SCI also exhibited significantly higher plasma levels of monokine induced by interferon-gamma/chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 9 (P<.03), macrophage colony stimulating factor (P<.035), interleukin-3 (P<.044), and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-beta) (P<.016). Among subjects with SCI, the levels of SCGF-beta increased with the time from initial injury. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the hypothesis that MIF is elevated in subjects with chronic SCI and identify additional novel immune mediators that are also elevated in these subjects. This study suggests the importance of examining the potential functional roles of MIF and other immune factors in subjects with chronic SCI.","['Stein, Adam', 'Panjwani, Arti', 'Sison, Cristina', 'Rosen, Lisa', 'Chugh, Radhika', 'Metz, Christine', 'Bank, Matthew', 'Bloom, Ona']","['Stein A', 'Panjwani A', 'Sison C', 'Rosen L', 'Chugh R', 'Metz C', 'Bank M', 'Bloom O']","['Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Hofstra North Shore-Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, The North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Manhasset, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130422,United States,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2985158R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokine CXCL9/blood', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/blood', 'Lectins, C-Type/blood', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*blood/etiology/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/11/01 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-9993(13)00310-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.apmr.2013.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2013 Aug;94(8):1498-507. doi: 10.1016/j.apmr.2013.04.004.

Based on patient age, different questionnaires were used to assess QoL. To evaluate the association between HSCT and each type of late effect or QoL dimension, the appropriate multivariate regressions were performed. QoL mean scores were compared with those obtained for age- and sex-matched French control subjects. Of all the survivors, 674 (71.5%) had at least 1 late effect, with the risk being 5.0 CI95 (3.0-8.6) times higher for transplantation survivors.

Structure-activity relationships led to the discovery of sulfonamide, carbamate and urea series of FLT3 inhibitors. Previous studies showed that the sulfonamide 4 and carbamate 5 series were potent and selective FLT3 inhibitors with good in vivo efficacy. Herein, we describe the urea series, which we found to be potent inhibitors of FLT3 and VEGFR2.

In preliminary in vivo toxicity studies of the four most active compounds, 10f was found to be the least toxic. A further in vivo efficacy study demonstrated that 10f achieved complete tumor regression in a higher proportion of MOLM-13 xenograft mice than 4 and 5 (70% vs 10% and 40%). These results show that compound 10f possesses improved pharmacologic and selectivity profiles and could be more effective than previously disclosed FLT3 inhibitors in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Lin, Wen-Hsing', 'Hsu, John T-A', 'Hsieh, Shu-Yi', 'Chen, Chiung-Tong', 'Song, Jen-Shin', 'Yen, Shih-Chieh', 'Hsu, Tsu', 'Lu, Cheng-Tai', 'Chen, Chun-Hwa', 'Chou, Ling-Hui', 'Yang, Yung-Ning', 'Chiu, Ching-Hui', 'Chen, Ching-Ping', 'Tseng, Ya-Ju', 'Yen, Kuei-Jung', 'Yeh, Ching-Fang', 'Chao, Yu-Sheng', 'Yeh, Teng-Kuang', 'Jiaang, Weir-Torn']","['Lin WH', 'Hsu JT', 'Hsieh SY', 'Chen CT', 'Song JS', 'Yen SC', 'Hsu T', 'Lu CT', 'Chen CH', 'Chou LH', 'Yang YN', 'Chiu CH', 'Chen CP', 'Tseng YJ', 'Yen KJ', 'Yeh CF', 'Chao YS', 'Yeh TK', 'Jiaang WT']","['Institute of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, National Health Research Institutes, No. 35, Keyan Rd., Zhunan Town, Miaoli Country 350, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130406,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Discovery', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Urea/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(13)00317-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.083 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2013 Jun 1;21(11):2856-67. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.083.

Clinical trials have demonstrated second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) dasatinib and nilotinib can restore complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) and major molecular response (MMR) to many patients failing imatinib, but their impact in the general population is not clear. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report CML outcome in a population of 2.3 million people in a geographically contiguous area of North West England and North Wales. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2009, 192 new CML cases were diagnosed, of whom 184 were in chronic phase and 160 started on imatinib. The maximal CCR rate was 65% at 24 months and the maximal MMR rate was 50% at 36 months. Patients diagnosed since second generation TKI became available for imatinib failure had a more rapid cumulative CCR and MMR rate and a significantly improved progression free survival (p=0.022) than those diagnosed before this time. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that second generation TKI have improved CML outcome in the general population.","['Francis, Sebastian', 'Lucas, Claire', 'Lane, Steven', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Watmough, Sarah', 'Knight, Katy', 'Bell, Jo', 'Kaleel-Rahman, Mohammed', 'Lee, Edwin', ""O'Brien, David"", 'Butt, Nauman M', 'Sadik, Walid', 'De Soysa, Lally', 'Seale, Jim R C', 'Salim, Rahuman', 'Clark, Richard E']","['Francis S', 'Lucas C', 'Lane S', 'Wang L', 'Watmough S', 'Knight K', 'Bell J', 'Kaleel-Rahman M', 'Lee E', ""O'Brien D"", 'Butt NM', 'Sadik W', 'De Soysa L', 'Seale JR', 'Salim R', 'Clark RE']","['Haematology Department, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK.

However, an formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tissue sample of the patient's childhood Wilms tumor showed WT1- positivity restricted to the renal tumor cells, so the WT1 gene was investigated further.

However, the risk of experiencing a second primary malignancy or other disease has increased significantly. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Mongolian man with a large mass in his right lower abdomen was admitted to our hospital 15 years previously. The mass was removed, and confirmed via pathological examination to be a malignant B-cell lymphoma in the appendix and distal small bowel. Post-operative chemotherapy with standard cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, vincristine (Oncovin(R)) and prednisolone regimen was given for six cycles. No obvious recurrence was detected over the following 12 years. Subsequently, a mass in the right lung was found on a regular X-ray follow-up; our patient did not report chills, fever or cough. Chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans confirmed the mass. A primary lung carcinoma was considered to be the most likely diagnosis. However, after an exploratory thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy was performed a pathological examination of tissue samples demonstrated a lung cryptococcal granuloma, with positive staining for periodic acid Schiff and periodic acid-silver metheramine. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the normal population, second primary malignancy (in particular leukaemia and lung cancer) in patients with malignant lymphoma during their long-term survival has been seen occasionally. However, other diagnoses should also be considered such as pulmonary cryptococcosis. Other than computed-tomography-guided needle biopsy, surgery for some patients is a much more appropriate choice, which could also help attain correct diagnosis and treatment.","['Yuan, Ying', 'Shen, Hong', 'Hu, Hanguang', 'Ye, Xiaoxian', 'Zhong, Xian']","['Yuan Y', 'Shen H', 'Hu H', 'Ye X', 'Zhong X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130425,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,PMC3657547,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/04/27 06:01,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/27 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-7-113 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-7-113 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2013 Apr 25;7:113. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-7-113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To determine whether this cellular factor influences Mo-MuLV replication and viral disease pathogenesis in vivo, we generated a ZASC1 knockout mouse model and completed both early infection and long term disease pathogenesis studies. RESULTS: Mice lacking ZASC1 were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and showed no obvious physical or behavioral defects. Analysis of bone marrow samples revealed a specific increase in a common myeloid progenitor cell population in ZASC1-deficient mice, a result that is of considerable interest because osteoclasts derived from the myeloid lineage are among the first bone marrow cells infected by Mo-MuLV (J. Virol. 73: 1617-1623, 1999). Indeed, Mo-MuLV infection of neonatal mice revealed that ZASC1 is required for efficient early virus replication in the bone marrow, but not in the thymus or spleen. However, the absence of ZASC1 did not influence the timing of subsequent tumor progression or the types of tumors resulting from virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: These studies have revealed that ZASC1 is important for myeloid cell differentiation in the bone marrow compartment and that this cellular factor is required for efficient Mo-MuLV replication in this tissue at an early time point post-infection.","['Seidel, Shannon', 'Bruce, James', 'Leblanc, Mathias', 'Lee, Kuo-Fen', 'Fan, Hung', 'Ahlquist, Paul', 'Young, John A T']","['Seidel S', 'Bruce J', 'Leblanc M', 'Lee KF', 'Fan H', 'Ahlquist P', 'Young JA']","['Nomis Center for Immunobiology and Microbial Pathogenesis, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130424,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*virology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', '*Virus Replication']",PMC3654992,2013/04/27 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-10-130 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-10-130 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2013 Apr 24;10:130. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-130.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (ZNF639 protein, mouse)']",,,"['P30 CA014195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD034534/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'NS072031/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS060833/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the condition has a variable clinical course, the trend is towards eventual relapse and the disease is considered incurable. Whilst the majority of the circulating CD5-positive neoplastic B cells are arrested in the G0 phase of the cell cycle, those in the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues proliferate at a rate of 0.1-1% of the entire clone per day. This proliferation is supported by the tissue microenvironment, which has been shown to induce upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and enhance the survival of the neoplastic cells. Microenvironmental factors are also thought to be important in tumour relapse and resistance to therapy. This review outlines the main signalling pathways involved in these tumour cell-stromal interactions, and includes potential therapeutic strategies based on the manipulation of key components within the CLL microenvironment.","['Ramsay, Alan D', 'Rodriguez-Justo, Manuel']","['Ramsay AD', 'Rodriguez-Justo M']","['Department of Cellular Pathology, University College Hospital London, London, UK. a.ramsay@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130425,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Movement', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics/immunology']",,2013/04/27 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12344 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Jul;162(1):15-24. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12344.

Sensitive quantitative assays are required for both applications, particularly for the monitoring of minimal residual disease, which requires not only high sensitivity but also very high specificity. METHODS: We developed a highly sensitive probe-free quantitative mutant-allele detection method, Quantitative Threefold Allele-Specific PCR (QuanTAS-PCR), that is performed in a closed-tube system, thus eliminating the manipulation of PCR products. QuantTAS-PCR uses a threefold approach to ensure allele-specific amplification of the mutant sequence: (i) a mutant allele-specific primer, (ii) a 3'dideoxy blocker to suppress false-positive amplification from the wild-type template and (iii) a PCR specificity enhancer, also to suppress false-positive amplification from the wild-type template. Mutant alleles were quantified relative to exon 9 of JAK2. RESULTS: We showed that the addition of the 3'dideoxy blocker suppressed but did not eliminate false-positive amplification from the wild-type template. However, the addition of the PCR specificity enhancer near eliminated false-positive amplification from the wild-type allele. Further discrimination between true and false positives was enabled by using the quantification cycle (Cq) value of a single mutant template as a cut-off point, thus enabling robust distinction between true and false positives. As 10,000 JAK2 templates were used per replicate, the assay had a sensitivity of 1/10(-4) per replicate. Greater sensitivity could be reached by increasing the number of replicates analysed. Variation in replicates when low mutant-allele templates were present necessitated the use of a statistics-based approach to estimate the load of mutant JAK2 copies. QuanTAS-PCR showed comparable quantitative results when validated against a commercial assay. CONCLUSIONS: QuanTAS-PCR is a simple, cost-efficient, closed-tube method for JAK2 V617F mutation quantification that can detect very low levels of the mutant allele, thus enabling analysis of minimal residual disease. The approach can be extended to the detection of other recurrent single nucleotide somatic changes in cancer.","['Zapparoli, Giada V', 'Jorissen, Robert N', 'Hewitt, Chelsee A', 'McBean, Michelle', 'Westerman, David A', 'Dobrovic, Alexander']","['Zapparoli GV', 'Jorissen RN', 'Hewitt CA', 'McBean M', 'Westerman DA', 'Dobrovic A']","['Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St Andrews Place, East Melbourne, Victoria 3002, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130424,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Alleles', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'DNA Primers', 'Exons', 'False Positive Reactions', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Point Mutation', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",PMC3658971,2013/04/27 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/04/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-206 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-206 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Apr 24;13:206. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-206.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tonic signaling through the BCR provides growth and signals to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Antigen engagement of BCR is followed by intracellular recruitment and activation of BCR-associated kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K). Inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of the BCR induces disruption of chemokine-mediated CLL cell migration and cell killing. BCR signal transduction inhibitors represent a promising new strategy for targeted CLL treatment. A number of therapeutic agents have recently been developed with significant activity in CLL. The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor. The clinical activity of ibrutinib, GS-1101 and fostamatinib in patients with CLL is associated with marked lymphocytosis due to release of tumor cells from the lymph nodes into the peripheral blood. Further studies are ongoing with single agents and their combinations with other targeted and conventional therapies.

The viral regulatory protein Tax1 plays a pivotal role in T-cell transformation and ATL development. Previous studies in our laboratory, using the yeast 2-hybrid approach to screen a T-cell library for Tax1-interacting partners, identified the cellular Four and a Half Lim domain protein 3 (FHL3) as a possible Tax1-interacting candidate. FHL3 is a member of the FHL family of proteins, which function as transcriptional coactivators and cytoskeleton regulators and have a role in cancer progression and development. The aim of this study was to investigate the physical and functional interaction between Tax1 and members of the FHL family of proteins. We show that Tax1 and FHL3 interact both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, both FHL1 and -2 also interact with Tax1. We have demonstrated that FHL3 enhances Tax1-mediated activation of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) without affecting basal activity and that FHL1 to -3 regulate NF-kappaB activation by Tax1 in a cell-specific manner. In addition, we have found that the interaction between Tax1 and FHL1 to -3 affects the localization of these proteins, leading to their redistribution in cells. Tax1 also affected FHL3 cytoskeleton function by increasing FHL3-mediated cell spreading. Overall, our results suggest that the interaction between Tax1 and the FHL family alters both the transactivating activity and the subcellular localization of Tax1 and provide new insights into molecular mechanisms that underlie the oncogenic nature of this HTLV-1 protein.","['McCabe, Aine', 'Hashimoto, Kenichi', 'Hall, William W', 'Sheehy, Noreen']","['McCabe A', 'Hashimoto K', 'Hall WW', 'Sheehy N']","['Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130424,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism/physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*virology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",PMC3700305,2013/04/26 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00070-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00070-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jul;87(13):7435-44. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00070-13.

Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is required for promoting germinal center reactions and virus-specific neutralizing antibodies at later time points postinfection, but TLR7's role in early acute infection has not been determined. By infecting TLR7-deficient mice with a retroviral pathogen, Friend virus (FV), I determined that TLR7 potently inhibits retroviral replication during the first 5 days of infection and is required for rapid secretion of virus-specific IgM and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in response to infection. Although the IgM response was nonneutralizing, plasmas from wild-type mice but not TLR7-deficient mice inhibited FV replication when passively transferred to infected mice, suggesting an indirect mechanism of antibody function. Interestingly, IL-10 was secreted primarily by CD4 T cells, and IL-10-deficient mice also exhibited accelerated early virus spread, demonstrating that this response inhibits acute infection. Surprisingly, TLR7-deficient mice exhibited normal or elevated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines during acute infection, revealing the existence of a TLR7-independent retrovirus-sensing pathway that drives inflammatory cytokine secretion. Together, these results establish a previously unappreciated role for lymphocytes in mediating rapid TLR7-dependent inhibition of early retroviral infection through nonneutralizing IgM and IL-10.","['Browne, Edward P']",['Browne EP'],"['Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. ebrowne@mit.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130424,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/genetics/*immunology', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",PMC3700304,2013/04/26 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00788-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00788-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jul;87(13):7357-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00788-13.

The viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) establishes cell-cell contacts and subsequently recruits Gag by a process that depends on its cytoplasmic tail. MLV Gag is recruited to virological synapses through the matrix domain (MA) (J. Jin, F. Li, and W. Mothes, J. Virol. 85:7672-7682, 2011). However, how MA targets Gag to sites of cell-cell contact remains unknown. Here we report that basic residues within MA are critical for directing MLV Gag to virological synapses. Alternative membrane targeting domains (MTDs) containing multiple basic residues can efficiently substitute MA to direct polarized assembly. Similarly, mutations in the polybasic cluster of MA that disrupt Gag polarization can be rescued by N-terminal addition of MTDs containing basic residues. MTDs containing basic residues alone fail to be targeted to the virological synapse. Systematic deletion experiments reveal that domains within Gag known to mediate Gag multimerization are also required. Thus, our data predict the existence of a specific ""acidic"" interface at virological synapses that mediates the recruitment of MLV Gag via the basic cluster of MA and Gag multimerization.","['Li, Fei', 'Jin, Jing', 'Herrmann, Christin', 'Mothes, Walther']","['Li F', 'Jin J', 'Herrmann C', 'Mothes W']","['Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130424,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",PMC3676119,2013/04/26 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03263-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03263-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jun;87(12):7113-26. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03263-12.

PAX5 is an important regulator of B-lymphoid development and blocks myeloid differentiation when ectopically expressed. To understand the molecular mechanism of PAX5 deregulation, we examined its chromatin structure and regulation in t(8;21) AML cells, non-t(8;21) myeloid precursor control cells, and pre-B cells. In non-t(8;21) myeloid precursors, PAX5 is poised for transcription, but is repressed by polycomb complexes. In t(8;21) AML, PAX5 is not directly activated by RUNX1/ETO, but expression requires constitutive mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling. Using a model of t(8;21) carrying an activating KIT mutation, we demonstrate that deregulated MAP kinase signaling in t(8;21) AML abrogates the association of polycomb complexes to PAX5 and leads to aberrant gene activation. Our findings therefore suggest a novel role of activating tyrosine kinase mutations in lineage-inappropriate gene expression in AML.","['Ray, Debleena', 'Kwon, So Yeon', 'Tagoh, Hiromi', 'Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Ptasinska, Anetta', 'Bonifer, Constanze']","['Ray D', 'Kwon SY', 'Tagoh H', 'Heidenreich O', 'Ptasinska A', 'Bonifer C']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130424,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2013/04/26 06:00,2013/10/29 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56043-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-02-482497 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 1;122(5):759-69. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-02-482497.

The result of the action of C2GnT is the core 2 structure that is essential for the further elongation of the carbohydrate chains of O-glycans. The catalytic mechanism of this metal-ion-independent glycosyltransferase is of paramount importance and is investigated here by using quantum mechanical (QM) (density functional theory (DFT))/molecular modeling (MM) methods with different levels of theory. The structural model of the reaction site used in this report is based on the crystal structures of C2GnT. The entire enzyme-substrate system was subdivided into two different subsystems: the QM subsystem containing 206 atoms and the MM region containing 5914 atoms. Three predefined reaction coordinates were employed to investigate the catalytic mechanism. The calculated potential energy surfaces discovered the existence of a concerted SN 2-like mechanism. In this mechanism, a nucleophilic attack by O6 facilitated by proton transfer to the catalytic base and the separation of the leaving group all occur almost simultaneously. The transition state for the proposed reaction mechanism at the M06-2X/6-31G** (with diffuse functions on the O1', O5', OGlu , and O6 atoms) level was located at C1-O6=1.74 A and C1-O1=2.86 A. The activation energy for this mechanism was estimated to be between 20 and 29 kcal mol(-)(1), depending on the method used. These calculations also identified a low-barrier hydrogen bond between the nucleophile O6H and the catalytic base Glu320, and a hydrogen bond between the N-acetamino group and the glycosidic oxygen of the donor in the TS. It is proposed that these interactions contribute to a stabilization of TS and participate in the catalytic mechanism.","['Tvaroska, Igor', 'Kozmon, Stanislav', 'Wimmerova, Michaela', 'Koca, Jaroslav']","['Tvaroska I', 'Kozmon S', 'Wimmerova M', 'Koca J']","['Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 845 38 Bratislava, Slovak Republic. chemitsa@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130424,Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,IM,"['*Biocatalysis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Ions/chemistry', 'Metals/chemistry', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Quantum Theory', 'Substrate Specificity']",,2013/04/26 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/chem.201300383 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2013 Jun 17;19(25):8153-62. doi: 10.1002/chem.201300383.

Cytogenetic mosaicism is considered to be one of the important characteristics in expression of phenotypic manifestations. However, it has not come into focus due to emerging molecular biological approaches and the results of a number of mutation studies. Clinical correlates and prognostic relevance of mosaicism were evaluated in 163 AML patients [adverse-risk karyotypes (n = 72) and undefined karyotypes (n = 91)]. All patients were treated by induction and consolidation chemotherapies and finally went on hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT). Patients were divided into two subgroups, either with or without normal karyotype (NK) mosaicism. Seventy patients exhibited NK mosaicism and 93 did not. There were no significant differences in age, gender, chemotherapy cycles to achieve CR, HSCT donor type, source or intensity properties between the two subgroups. We found that NK mosaicism remaining in adverse-risk and undefined karyotype at diagnosis significantly correlates with better OS (p = 0.001) and lower CIR (p = 0.021) rate after HSCT. Our data show that the poor prognostic properties of unfavorable risk karyotype can be overcome to a great extent by allogeneic HSCT and chronic GVHD, especially in the subgroup with NK mosaicism.

The availability of immunologic biomarkers to predict patients at high risk could allow clinicians to accelerate alternative treatments such as stem cell transplantation, immunotherapy, or novel drugs. We have previously reported that first diagnostic (FD) ITD(+) AML showed immunophenotypic and functional characteristics of arrested dendritic cell (DC) precursors. In this study, we show that the high frequency of precursor DCs in 16 FD ITD(+) AML samples (Lin(-)/HLA-DR(+)/CD11c(+)/CD123(+)) was associated with a lack of terminal DCs (myeloid DCs: BDCA-1(+) or BDCA-3(+); plasmacytoid DC: BDCA-2(+)). We further evaluated prospectively the peripheral blood complete remission (CR) samples obtained from 11 ITD(+) AML patients after chemotherapy regarding the frequency of DCs and their pattern of cytokine production. Whereas the aberrant frequencies of precursor and terminal plasmacytoid DCs resolved during remission, the myeloid DC compartment did not fully recover. For an available cohort of patients (n = 4) who could be monitored over a period of >15 months after FD, we identified IL-10, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta as cytokines produced by the CR samples at high levels a few months prior to relapse. Cell-free supernatant of an FD ITD(+) AML sample stimulated monocytes obtained from two healthy donors to secrete IL-10, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta. Thus, we hypothesize that ITD(+) AML minimal residual disease can act directly as dysfunctional antigen-presenting cells or indirectly by production of factors that convert monocytes into myeloid-derived suppressor cells secreting cytokines that promote immune evasion. Monitoring these immunologic biomarkers could improve prediction of relapse.","['Rickmann, Mareike', 'Macke, Laura', 'Sundarasetty, Bala Sai', 'Stamer, Kathrin', 'Figueiredo, Constanca', 'Blasczyk, Rainer', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Krauter, Juergen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Stripecke, Renata']","['Rickmann M', 'Macke L', 'Sundarasetty BS', 'Stamer K', 'Figueiredo C', 'Blasczyk R', 'Heuser M', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Stripecke R']","['Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School (MHH), OE 6860, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130425,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*blood/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Female', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC3701796,2013/04/26 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1744-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Aug;92(8):1079-90. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1744-y.

With this in mind and also given the important role of BcR and TLR signaling and microRNAs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we investigated whether microRNAs could be implicated in shaping the behavior of CLL clones with distinct BcR and TLR molecular and functional profiles. To this end, we examined 79 CLL cases for the expression of 33 microRNAs, selected on the following criteria: (a) deregulated in CLL versus normal B-cells; (b) differentially expressed in CLL subgroups with distinct clinicobiological features; and, (c) if meeting (a) + (b), having predicted targets in the immune signaling pathways. Significant upregulation of miR-150, miR-29c, miR-143 and miR-223 and downregulation of miR-15a was found in mutated versus unmutated CLL, with miR-15a showing the highest fold difference. Comparison of two major subsets with distinct stereotyped BcRs and signaling signatures, namely subset 1 [IGHV1/5/7-IGKV1(D)-39, unmutated, bad prognosis] versus subset 4 [IGHV4-34/IGKV2-30, mutated, good prognosis] revealed differences in the expression of miR-150, miR-29b, miR-29c and miR-101, all down-regulated in subset 1. We were also able to link these distinct microRNA profiles with cellular phenotypes, importantly showing that, in subset 1, miR-101 downregulation is associated with overexpression of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) protein, which has been associated with clinical aggressiveness in other B-cell lymphomas. In conclusion, specific miRNAs differentially expressed among CLL subgroups with distinct BcR and/or TLR signaling may modulate the biological and clinical behavior of the CLL clones.","['Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Chartomatsidou, Elisavet', 'Papadopoulos, Giorgio', 'Hatzigeorgiou, Artemis', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achiles', 'Chlichlia, Katerina', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Muzio, Marta', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Papakonstantinou N', 'Ntoufa S', 'Chartomatsidou E', 'Papadopoulos G', 'Hatzigeorgiou A', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Chlichlia K', 'Ghia P', 'Muzio M', 'Belessi C', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunobiology, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,IM,"['Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetic Phenomena', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology']",PMC3667214,2013/04/26 06:00,2013/12/25 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2013.00005 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2013.00005 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2013 May 20;19:115-23. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2013.00005.,,,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of molecules can serve as targets, according to the condition being treated. Now entering human clinical trials, CD38 molecule is a particularly attractive target because of its peculiar pattern of expression and its twin role as receptor and ectoenzyme. This review provides a range of analytical perspectives on the current progress in and challenges to anti-CD38 mAb therapy. We present a synopsis of the evidence available on CD38, particularly in myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our aim is to make the data from basic science helpful and accessible to a diverse clinical audience and, at the same time, to improve its potential for in vivo use. The topics covered include tissue distribution and signal implementation by mAb ligation and the possibility of increasing cell density on target cells by exploiting information about the molecule's regulation in combination with drugs approved for in vivo use. Also analyzed is the behavior of CD38 as an enzyme: CD38 is a component of a pathway leading to the production of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment, thus inducing local anergy. Consequently, not only might CD38 be a prime target for mAb-mediated therapy, but its functional block may contribute to general improvement in cancer immunotherapy and outcomes.","['Chillemi, Antonella', 'Zaccarello, Gianluca', 'Quarona, Valeria', 'Ferracin, Manuela', 'Ghimenti, Chiara', 'Massaia, Massimo', 'Horenstein, Alberto L', 'Malavasi, Fabio']","['Chillemi A', 'Zaccarello G', 'Quarona V', 'Ferracin M', 'Ghimenti C', 'Massaia M', 'Horenstein AL', 'Malavasi F']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino Medical School, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130520,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy']",PMC3667209,2013/04/26 06:00,2013/12/25 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2013.00009 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2013.00009 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2013 May 20;19:99-108. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2013.00009.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of resistance mechanisms, first tested in vitro and then in vivo, have driven the development of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib and nilotinib. These agents have been proven effective in a large number of patients resistant to imatinib and are also effective in older patients. The use of second-generation TKIs in first-line treatment has increased the rate of cytogenetic and molecular responses and reduced the number of patients experiencing disease progression. In this review, we detail the various mechanisms of resistance and management options for refractory patients, in particular in older patients. No differences in terms of efficacy were reported in this subset of patients when treated with nilotinib or dasatinib after imatinib resistance. Results of trials that tested second-generation TKIs as first-line treatment showed similar results in older and younger patients.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2013/04/26 06:00,2014/06/27 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40266-013-0085-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2013 Jul;30(7):467-77. doi: 10.1007/s40266-013-0085-9.,7,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While these particles can induce leukemia and bone cancer due to internal exposure, they can also be beneficial for targeted radiation therapies. In this paper, a trabecular bone model is presented to investigate the radiation dose from bone- and marrow-seeking alpha and beta emitters to different critical compartments (targets) of trabecular bone for different age groups. Two main issues are addressed with Monte Carlo simulations. The first is the absorption fractions (AFs) from bone and marrow to critical targets within the bone for different age groups. The other issue is the application of (223)Ra for the radiotherapy treatment of bone metastases. Both a static model and a simulated bone remodeling process are established for trabecular bone. The results show significantly lower AFs from radionuclide sources in the bone volume to the peripheral marrow and the haematopoietic marrow for adults than for newborns and children. The AFs from sources on the bone surface and in the bone marrow to peripheral marrow and haematopoietic marrow also varies for adults and children depending on the energy of the particles. Regarding the use of (223)Ra as a radionuclide for the radiotherapy of bone metastases, the simulations show a significantly higher dose from (223)Ra and its progeny in forming bone to the target compartment of bone metastases than that from two other more commonly used beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals, (153)Sm and (89)Sr. There is also a slightly lower dose from (223)Ra in forming bone to haematopoietic marrow than that from (153)Sm and (89)Sr. These results indicate a higher therapy efficiency and lower marrow toxicity from (223)Ra and its progeny.

The biosafety characteristics of retroviral vectors in keratinocytes are, however, poorly defined. We developed self-inactivating (SIN) vectors derived from the Moloney murine leukemia (MLV) and the human immunodeficiency (HIV) viruses expressing therapeutic levels of LAMB3, a transgene defective in junctional EB, and tested their integration profile in human primary keratinocytes. The SIN-HIV vector showed the expected preference for transcribed genes while the SIN-MLV vector integrated preferentially in regulatory elements, but showed a significantly lower tendency to target cell growth-related genes, transcription start sites and epigenetically defined promoters compared with a wild-type MLV vector in an epithelial cell context. A quantitative gene expression assay in individual keratinocyte clones showed that MLV-derived vectors deregulate expression of targeted genes at a lower frequency than in hematopoietic cells, and that the SIN-MLV design has the lowest activity compared to both MLV and SIN-HIV vectors. This study indicates that SIN-MLV vectors may have a better safety profile in keratinocyte than in hematopoietic cells, and be a reasonable alternative to lentiviral vectors for gene therapy of inherited skin disorders.","['Cavazza, A', 'Cocchiarella, F', 'Bartholomae, C', 'Schmidt, M', 'Pincelli, C', 'Larcher, F', 'Mavilio, F']","['Cavazza A', 'Cocchiarella F', 'Bartholomae C', 'Schmidt M', 'Pincelli C', 'Larcher F', 'Mavilio F']","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130425,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*genetics/metabolism', 'Epidermolysis Bullosa/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Swiss 3T3 Cells', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Virus Inactivation', '*Virus Integration']",,2013/04/26 06:00,2014/03/08 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gt201318 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2013.18 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2013 Sep;20(9):949-57. doi: 10.1038/gt.2013.18.

Multiple regulatory mechanisms for these cellular processes have been identified. Emerging evidence has revealed that metabolism and bioenergetics play important roles in determining stem cell fate in concert with other regulatory networks. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in this field. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have helped define and redefine metabolic regulation of HSCs. Resting quiescent stem cells use primarily anaerobic glycolysis for energy production and this metabolic program is required to maintain a functional quiescent state. However, when they exit this state and rapidly proliferate and differentiate into different blood cell types, a robust up-regulation of energy metabolism is expected to meet the quickly rising energy demand. Dysregulation of metabolism in HSCs results in various blood disorders, including leukemia. SUMMARY: Energy metabolism and HSC activity influence and interlink each other in a highly sophisticated and orchestrated manner. Understanding metabolic regulation of HSC function has significant implications for HSC-based therapies and leukemogenesis research.","['Hsu, Peter', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Hsu P', 'Qu CK']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",PMC3736335,2013/04/26 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328360ab4d [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2013 Jul;20(4):289-94. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328360ab4d.,4,,,,,"['R01 DK092722/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL068212/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK092722/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL068212/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS499836'],,,,,,,,,,

We describe here a novel case of AML without maturation, where the leukemic cells harbored double idic(13)(p11.2) and a normal chromosome 13 resulting in pentasomy 13q. Analyses were done on aspirated bone marrow cells from diagnosis. We utilized G-banding analysis, 24-color karyotyping and additional FISH analyses with various locus-specific probes to characterize the chromosomal complement. Oligonucleotide-based 180K aCGH analysis was done to search for submicroscopic imbalances. The karyotype was 47,XY,idic(13)(p11.2)x2[23]/46,XY[2]. Pantelomeric FISH analysis indicated critically short telomeres. Oligo-based aCGH analysis confirmed high copy gain of chromosome 13q and did not disclose other genomic imbalances. Reviewing the literature, this may be the second case of pentasomy 13q, since idic(13)(p11.2), when analyzed by conventional cytogenetics, is indistinguishable from i(13)(q10). Both cases were associated with immature AML and a poor outcome. We propose that idic(13)(p11.2) is a new recurrent abnormality in AML without maturation and suggest that pentasomy 13q is an early event in pathogenesis of AML through amplification of genes located on 13q.","['Kjeldsen, E', 'Kallenbach, M']","['Kjeldsen E', 'Kallenbach M']","['Cancer Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.

The differentiation of endothelial cells and pre-adipocytes seems to be independent of extracellular Mg concentration.

Despite the usefulness of LPL for CLL prognosis, its functional role and the molecular mechanism regulating its expression are still open questions. Interaction of CLL B-cells with the tissue microenvironment favors disease progression by promoting malignant B-cell growth. Since tissue methylation can be altered by environmental factors, we investigated the methylation status of the LPL gene and the possibility that overexpression could be associated with microenvironment signals. Our results show that a demethylated state of the LPL gene is responsible for its anomalous expression in unmutated CLL cases and that this expression is dependent on microenvironment signals. Overall, this work proposes that an epigenetic mechanism, triggered by the microenvironment, regulates LPL expression in CLL disease.","['Abreu, Cecilia', 'Moreno, Pilar', 'Palacios, Florencia', 'Borge, Mercedes', 'Morande, Pablo', 'Landoni, Ana Ines', 'Gabus, Raul', 'Dighiero, Guillermo', 'Giordano, Mirta', 'Gamberale, Romina', 'Oppezzo, Pablo']","['Abreu C', 'Moreno P', 'Palacios F', 'Borge M', 'Morande P', 'Landoni AI', 'Gabus R', 'Dighiero G', 'Giordano M', 'Gamberale R', 'Oppezzo P']","['Recombinant Protein Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130621,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics']",,2013/04/26 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.796057 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Aug;54(8):1844-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.796057.

Using BH3 profiling, we found that CLL cells co-cultured with stroma are less primed to undergo apoptosis in response to BCL-2 inhibition. Currently, several approaches to BCL-2 inhibition with well-tolerated oral agents are in development in the clinic. Dosing of navitoclax (ABT-263) was complicated by thrombocytopenia due to BCL-XL inhibition, but the BCL-2 specific inhibitor ABT-199 (GDC-0199) should avoid this issue, and may overcome stroma-mediated resistance to apoptosis.

Differentiation therapy is considered to be a new strategy for treating this type of leukemia. Aclacinomycin A (ACM) is an antitumor antibiotic. Previous studies have shown that ACM induced erythroid differentiation of CML cells. In this study, we investigate the effect of ACM on the sensitivity of human CML cell line K562 to Bcr-Abl specific inhibitor imatinib (STI571, Gleevec). We first determined the optimal concentration of ACM for erythroid differentiation but not growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 cells. Then, pretreatment with this optimal concentration of ACM followed by a minimally toxic concentration of imatinib strongly induced growth inhibition and apoptosis compared to that with simultaneous co-treatment, indicating that ACM-induced erythroid differentiation sensitizes K562 cells to imatinib. Sequential treatment with ACM and imatinib induced Bcr-Abl down-regulation, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and caspase-3 activation, as well as decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL expressions, but did not affect Fas ligand/Fas death receptor and procaspase-8 expressions. ACM/imatinib sequential treatment-induced apoptosis was suppressed by a caspase-9 inhibitor and a caspase-3 inhibitor, indicating that the caspase cascade is involved in this apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ACM induced erythroid differentiation through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The inhibition of erythroid differentiation by p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190, p38MAPK dominant negative mutant or p38MAPK shRNA knockdown, reduced the ACM/imatinib sequential treatment-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis. These results suggest that differentiated K562 cells induced by ACM-mediated p38MAPK pathway become more sensitive to imatinib and result in down-regulations of Bcr-Abl and anti-apoptotic proteins, growth inhibition and apoptosis. These results provided a potential management by which ACM might have a crucial impact on increasing sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib in the differentiation therapeutic approaches.","['Lee, Yueh-Lun', 'Chen, Chih-Wei', 'Liu, Fu-Hwa', 'Huang, Yu-Wen', 'Huang, Huei-Mei']","['Lee YL', 'Chen CW', 'Liu FH', 'Huang YW', 'Huang HM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130417,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Aclarubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Erythroid Cells/drug effects/enzymology/*pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC3629111,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0061939 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-35969 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 17;8(4):e61939. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061939.

Our objective was to compare the incidence of childhood cancer in British Indians and Whites in Leicester, which has virtually complete, self-assigned, ethnicity data and the largest population of Indians in England. METHODS: We obtained data on all cancer registrations from 1996 to 2008 for Leicester with ethnicity obtained by linkage to the Hospital Episodes Statistics database. Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for childhood cancers in Indians and Whites as well as rate ratios, adjusted for age. RESULTS: There were 33 cancers registered among Indian children and 39 among White children. The incidence rate for Indians was greater compared to Whites for all cancers combined (RR 1.82 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.89); p = 0.01), with some evidence of increased risk of leukaemia (RR 2.20 (0.95 to 5.07); p = 0.07), lymphoma (RR 3.96 (0.99 to 15.84); p = 0.04) and central nervous system tumours (RR 2.70 (1.00 to 7.26); p = 0.05). Rates were also higher in British Indian children compared to children in India. CONCLUSIONS: British Indian children in Leicester had an increased risk of developing cancer compared to White children, largely due to a higher incidence of central nervous system and haematological malignancies.","['Sayeed, Shameq', 'Barnes, Isobel', 'Cairns, Benjamin J', 'Finlayson, Alexander', 'Ali, Raghib']","['Sayeed S', 'Barnes I', 'Cairns BJ', 'Finlayson A', 'Ali R']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130417,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Demography', 'England/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC3629092,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0061881 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-39230 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 17;8(4):e61881. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061881.

We identified 21 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) located in a coding region of 18 genes. Among them, the SNVs of three leukemia-related genes (MUC4, CNTNAP2, and GNAS) reported in previous studies were replicated in this study. We conducted stepwise genetic risk score (GRS) models composed of the NK-AML susceptible variants and evaluated the prediction accuracy of each GRS model by computing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

METHODS: A SCID mouse model for transplantation of human gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) was established using tumor cells from a patient who was diagnosed with GIST and consequently had been treated with imatinib. GIST cells cultured for 10 passages were used for inoculation into mice. Transfection of PS-ASODN was carried out with Lipotap Liposomal Transfection Reagent. GISTs that subsequently developed in SCID mice were subjected to intra-tumoral injection once daily from day 7 to day 28 post-inoculation, and mice were divided into the following four groups according to treatment: PS-ASODN group (5.00 mumoL/L of oligonucleotide, each mouse received 0.2 mL once daily); imatinib group (0.1 mg/g body weight); liposome negative control group (0.01 mL/g); and saline group (0.01 mL/g). On day 28, the mice were sacrificed, and tumor attributes including weight and longest and shortest diameters were measured. Tumor growth was compared between treatment groups, and telomerase activity was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect expression of the mRNA encoding the apoptosis inhibition B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) gene. RESULTS: In the PS-ASODN group, tumor growth was inhibited by 59.437%, which was markedly higher than in the imatinib group (11.071%) and liposome negative control group (2.759%) [tumor inhibition = (mean tumor weight of control group--mean tumor weight of treatment group)/(mean tumor weight of control group) x 100%]. Telomerase activity was significantly lower (P < 0.01) in the PS-ASODN group (0.689 +/- 0.158) compared with the imatinib group (1.838 +/- 0.241), liposome negative control group (2.013 +/- 0.273), and saline group (2.004 +/- 0.163). Flow cytometry revealed that the apoptosis rate of tumor cells treated with PS-ASODN was 20.751% +/- 0.789%, which was higher (P < 0.01) than that of the imatinib group (1.163% +/- 0.469%), liposome negative control group (1.212% +/- 0.310%), and saline group (1.172% +/- 0.403%). Expression of bcl-2 mRNA in the transplanted GISTs was markedly downregulated (P < 0.01) in the PS-ASODN group (7.245 +/- 0.739) compared with the imatinib group (14.153 +/- 1.618) and liposome negative control group (16.396 +/- 1.351). CONCLUSION: PS-ASODN can repress GIST growth, mediated perhaps by inhibition of telomerase activity and downregulation of bcl-2 expression.","['Sun, Xue-Cheng', 'Yan, Jing-Yi', 'Chen, Xiao-Lei', 'Huang, Ying-Peng', 'Shen, Xian', 'Ye, Xiao-Hua']","['Sun XC', 'Yan JY', 'Chen XL', 'Huang YP', 'Shen X', 'Ye XH']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA/*genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3631985,2013/04/25 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v19.i15.2340 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2013 Apr 21;19(15):2340-7. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v19.i15.2340.,15,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gastrointestinal stromal tumor', 'Imatinib', 'Phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides', 'Telomerase activity', 'Tumor inhibitory rate']",,,,,,,

In addition, to study the association between the different CCND1 polymorphic variants and the response to induction chemotherapy in ALL cases and clinicobiological parameters in breast cancer. METHODS: We evaluated the association of CCND1 G870A polymorphism with ALL risk in 25 ALL patients and 15 healthy controls and with breast cancer risk in 30 newly diagnosed breast cancer female patients and in 25 healthy controls. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for analysis of G870A polymorphism of CCND1 on anticoagulated whole blood of both the ALL and breast cancer cases and control groups. RESULTS: The frequency of the AA genotype was significantly increased in the ALL cases while GG genotype was significantly increased in the control group. Furthermore, there was a highly statistically significant association between the A allele in the homozygous state AA and the ALL cases. Furthermore, there was a positive risk of developing ALL when having the AA genotype and the results were highly significant for AA genotype compared to GG genotype. For breast cancer, the results revealed that there was a positive risk association for those carrying the CCND1 A allele in the development of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Homozygosity for CCND1 A allele was associated with ALL patients and was a risk factor for ALL development, while the presence of the A allele, whether in homozygous or heterozygous state was associated with breast cancer cases and was a risk for breast cancer .Homozygosity for CCND1 G allele was associated with the control group.","['Bedewy, A M L', 'Mostafa, M H', 'Saad, A A', 'El-Maghraby, S M', 'Bedewy, M M L', 'Hilal, A M', 'Kandil, L S']","['Bedewy AM', 'Mostafa MH', 'Saad AA', 'El-Maghraby SM', 'Bedewy MM', 'Hilal AM', 'Kandil LS']","['Department of Hematology, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. dr_ahmed_bedewy@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/06/28 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2013 Jan-Mar;18(1):227-38.,1,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, no information on microRNA (miRNA) expression in pPCL has been reported. This study aimed at investigating the involvement of miRNAs in pPCL and their possible relationship with higher tumor aggressiveness. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Global miRNA expression profiles were analyzed in highly purified malignant plasma cells from 18 pPCL untreated patients included in a prospective clinical trial. MiRNA expression patterns were evaluated in comparison with a representative series of multiple myeloma patients, in relation to the most recurrent chromosomal abnormalities (as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and single-nucleotide polymorphism-array analysis), and in association with clinical outcome. MiRNA expression was also integrated with gene expression profiles in pPCL and multiple myeloma samples. RESULTS: We identified a series of deregulated miRNAs in pPCL (42 upregulated and 41 downregulated) in comparison with multiple myeloma. Some of them, on the basis of their reported functions and putative target genes computed by integrative analysis, might have a role in the pathobiology of pPCL. As regards chromosomal aberrations, the expression of some miRNAs mapped to hotspot altered regions was associated with DNA copy number of the corresponding loci. Finally, 4 miRNA (miR-497, miR-106b, miR-181a*, and miR-181b) were identified as having expression levels that correlated with treatment response, and 4 (miR-92a, miR-330-3p, miR-22, and miR-146a) with clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study provides insights into the possible contribution of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of pPCL and suggests targets for future therapeutic investigations.","['Lionetti, Marta', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Di Martino, Maria Teresa', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Tuana, Giacomo', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Gallo Cantafio, Maria E', 'Grieco, Vitina', 'Bianchino, Gabriella', ""D'Auria, Fiorella"", 'Statuto, Teodora', 'Mazzoccoli, Carmela', 'De Luca, Luciana', 'Petrucci, Maria Teresa', 'Offidani, Massimo', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Falcone, Antonietta', 'Caravita, Tommaso', ""Omede', Paola"", 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Palumbo, Antonio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Lionetti M', 'Musto P', 'Di Martino MT', 'Fabris S', 'Agnelli L', 'Todoerti K', 'Tuana G', 'Mosca L', 'Gallo Cantafio ME', 'Grieco V', 'Bianchino G', ""D'Auria F"", 'Statuto T', 'Mazzoccoli C', 'De Luca L', 'Petrucci MT', 'Offidani M', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Falcone A', 'Caravita T', ""Omede' P"", 'Morabito F', 'Tassone P', 'Boccadoro M', 'Palumbo A', 'Neri A']","[""Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Hematology 1 CTMO, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130423,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2014/02/14 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2043 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2043 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 15;19(12):3130-42. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2043.

Many lines of evidence have shown that RUNX1 plays a critical role in regulating the development and precise maintenance of mammalian hematopoiesis. Studies using knockout mice have shown the importance of RUNX1 in a wide variety of hematopoietic cells, including hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes. Recently, target molecular processes of RUNX1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis have been revealed. Although RUNX1 is not required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, it is required for the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells due to RUNX1 deletion may be an important cause of human leukemias. Molecular abnormalities cooperating with loss of RUNX1 have also been identified. These findings may lead to a further understanding of human leukemias, and suggest novel molecular targeted therapies in the near future.","['Ichikawa, Motoshi', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Nakagawa, Masahiro', 'Nishimoto, Nahoko', 'Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Ichikawa M', 'Yoshimi A', 'Nakagawa M', 'Nishimoto N', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130424,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1347-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Jun;97(6):726-34. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1347-3.

To evaluate the dynamic variation and prognostic significance of AML1/ETO, bone marrow samples from 52 patients at different periods were examined qualitatively (32 patients) or quantitatively (20 patients) using nested RT-PCR and RQ-PCR, respectively. In the qualitative group, AML1/ETO in 71.88 and 95.45 % patients became negative at six and 24 months after CR, respectively. Patients in long-term remission were all RT-PCR-negative. Patients negative for AML1/ETO at 6-12 months and 12-18 months after CR had lower relapse rate (P = 0.003 and 0.000), higher relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.000 and 0.000), and overall survival (P = 0.001 and 0.000) than patients with positive AML1/ETO. Quantitative analysis showed that there was no trend where higher relapse rate occurred in patients with higher levels of AML1/ETO transcripts at diagnosis (P > 0.05). Patients whose AML1/ETO transcripts decreased by more than 2 log at CR had higher RFS (P = 0.02). At the checkpoints of 3 and 5/6 months after CR, patients with lower AML1/ETO copy numbers showed lower probability of relapse (P = 0.039 and 0.004).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), activating mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene result in survival and proliferation of leukemic blasts and are associated with adverse prognosis. Therefore, the FLT3 receptor is an appealing target for inhibition. Multiple small molecule TKIs are currently in development for FLT3-mutated AML, and agents are beginning to show promising efficacy. In other malignancies, the development of resistance to TKIs during the course of therapy has proven to be a challenge, and thus far, in clinical trials of FLT3 TKIs, resistance to inhibition represents a significant barrier to successful FLT3 inhibition. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance and overcoming these obstacles to target inhibition will be central to the success of these agents.","['Grunwald, Michael R', 'Levis, Mark J']","['Grunwald MR', 'Levis MJ']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA. grunwald@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130424,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1334-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Jun;97(6):683-94. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1334-8.

Here, we investigated the potential effect of alantolactone on Bcr/Abl+ imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells. Alantolactone treatment resulted in obvious apoptosis in both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant K562 cells, as shown by the increase in Annexin V-positive cells, caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage and mitochondrial membrane potential collapse. Alantolactone significantly inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene activity, decreased the DNA-binding activity of NF-capital O, CyrillickappaB, and blocked TNF-alpha-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. Of interest, the oncogenic Bcr/Abl fusion protein but not its mRNA levels were quickly reduced upon alantolactone exposure in imatinib-sensitive and -resistant K562 cells. Bcr/Abl knockdown enhanced the apoptosis driven by alantolactone. Bcr/Abl protein reduction could not be reversed by the addition of proteasome or caspase-3 inhibitors. The overexpression of p65 inhibited alantolactone-induced apoptosis, whereas p65 or Bcr/Abl silencing enhanced its apoptotic-inducing effect. Furthermore, Bcr/Abl-transfected 32D cells showed more sensitivity to alantolactone than vector-transfected control cells, and the Bcr/Abl protein was depleted, as observed in K562 cells. Finally, alantolactone-induced apoptosis was also observed in primary CD34+ CML leukemic cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that alantolactone is a promising potent agent to fight against CML cells via the inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and depletion of the Bcr/Abl protein.","['Wei, Wei', 'Huang, He', 'Zhao, Shan', 'Liu, Wei', 'Liu, Chuan-Xu', 'Chen, Li', 'Li, Jun-Min', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Yan, Hua']","['Wei W', 'Huang H', 'Zhao S', 'Liu W', 'Liu CX', 'Chen L', 'Li JM', 'Wu YL', 'Yan H']","['Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, No. 197, Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes, Eudesmane/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0854-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Sep;18(9):1060-70. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0854-2.,9,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes, Eudesmane)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'M7GSN5Q1M6 (alantolactone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of germline copy number variations (CNVs) to LFS in families without detectable TP53 mutation. Using a custom-designed high-resolution array CGH, we evaluated the presence of rare germline CNVs in 64 patients fulfilling the Chompret criteria for LFS, but without any detectable TP53 alteration. In 15 unrelated patients, we detected 20 new CNVs absent in 600 controls. Remarkably, in four patients who had developed each brain tumour, the detected CNV overlap the KDM1A, MTA3, TRRAP or SIRT3 genes encoding p53 partners involved in histone methylation or acetylation. Focused analysis of SIRT3 showed that the CNV encompassing SIRT3 leads to SIRT3 overexpression, and that in vitro SIRT3 overexpression prevents apoptosis, increases G2/M and results in a hypermethylation of numerous genes. This study supports the causal role of germline alterations of genes involved in chromatin remodelling in genetic predisposition to cancer and, in particular, to brain tumours.","['Aury-Landas, Juliette', 'Bougeard, Gaelle', 'Castel, Helene', 'Hernandez-Vargas, Hector', 'Drouet, Aurelie', 'Latouche, Jean-Baptiste', 'Schouft, Marie-Therese', 'Ferec, Claude', 'Leroux, Dominique', 'Lasset, Christine', 'Coupier, Isabelle', 'Caron, Olivier', 'Herceg, Zdenko', 'Frebourg, Thierry', 'Flaman, Jean-Michel']","['Aury-Landas J', 'Bougeard G', 'Castel H', 'Hernandez-Vargas H', 'Drouet A', 'Latouche JB', 'Schouft MT', 'Ferec C', 'Leroux D', 'Lasset C', 'Coupier I', 'Caron O', 'Herceg Z', 'Frebourg T', 'Flaman JM']","['1] Inserm, U1079, Faculty of Medicine, University of Rouen, Rouen, France [2] Institute for Research and Innovation in Biomedicine, University of Rouen, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130424,England,Eur J Hum Genet,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,9302235,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Sirtuin 3/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",PMC3831081,2013/04/25 06:00,2014/08/05 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ejhg201368 [pii]', '10.1038/ejhg.2013.68 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Hum Genet. 2013 Dec;21(12):1369-76. doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2013.68.

We wanted to study the role of genetic variants in behavioral problems in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Behavioral problems in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (n=138) were investigated longitudinally, using the Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire and multilevel statistical modeling. Thirty-four candidate polymorphisms, related to anticancer drug effects, were investigated. RESULTS: NOS3 gene functional polymorphisms showed significant association: patients homozygous for the minor allele at investigated loci showed decreased externalizing behavioral problems scores over time (t tests: T-786C n=69, P=0.003; G894T n=71, P=0.065). The effect was even more pronounced for individuals that are homozygous for the -786C844T haplotype (t test, n=69, P<0.001) and results were supported by multilevel modeling analyses (P<0.001). No such association was observed for internalizing behavioral problems. CONCLUSION: NOS3 variants modulate externalizing problems individual trajectories, likely in relationship with glucocorticoid exposure.","['Marcoux, Sophie', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Gahier, Annabel', 'Labuda, Malgorzata', 'Rousseau, Julie', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Marcoux S', 'Robaey P', 'Gahier A', 'Labuda M', 'Rousseau J', 'Sinnett D', 'Moghrabi A', 'Laverdiere C', 'Krajinovic M']","['Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Disorders/chemically induced/enzymology/*etiology/genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Haplotypes', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/psychology']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31828e518d [doi]', '00043426-201305000-00027 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 May;35(4):e157-62. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31828e518d.,4,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty osteosarcoma patients were an appropriate population studied as they have no intrinsic neurological involvement. The neuropsychological and psychosocial status was tested in 2 groups of patients treated with similar protocols containing repeated doses of high-dose methotrexate, but different doses of FA. The patients received 300 to 600 mg/m or 120 to 250 mg/m FA in their protocols. METHODS: Eighteen tests or subtests of neuropsychological assessment were tested. RESULTS: Eleven of 18 tests were significant at the P=0.025 level favoring the group treated with high dose of FA. There were no clear results in the psychosocial measures with only a single measure of self-esteem (understanding) being significantly higher (P=0.024) in the group treated with high dose of FA, other measures had no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between a higher dose of FA after high-dose methotrexate and a better neuropsychological status was clearly shown. The doses of FA used in the low FA group, 120 to 250 mg/m, were similar to those used by several groups treating children with leukemia; some have used even lower doses and report gross neurotoxicity.","['Bonda-Shkedi, Esther', 'Arush, Myriam Weyl Ben', 'Kaplinsky, Chaim', 'Ash, Shifra', 'Goshen, Yaakov', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Cohen, Ian J']","['Bonda-Shkedi E', 'Arush MW', 'Kaplinsky C', 'Ash S', 'Goshen Y', 'Yaniv I', 'Cohen IJ']","[""Department of Hematology Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tikva, Israel.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology/*prevention & control/*psychology', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31828c2da1 [doi]', '00043426-201305000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 May;35(4):271-5. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31828c2da1.,4,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the high rate of cure, ALL is one of the leading causes of death in children with tumor. For this reason, there is a keen interest in identifying genetic and biological features that influence the pathogenesis of ALL and the risk of treatment failure. The application of standard diagnostic technologies such as a conventional karyotype and polymerase chain reaction methodologies, together with gene expression profiling and genome-wide analyses, allows us to genetically characterize almost 100% of children with ALL. This review provides basic information about well-established genetic alterations associated with specific clinical subtypes and new molecular lesions with potential prognostic impact. New insights are reported on the natural history of ALL. Genetic aberrations in childhood ALL are considered both markers of disease and potential targets of treatment. Here, each biological subtype under the genetic point of view has been dissected, including genes involved in the development of lymphocytes and considerations on ALL in infancy. It is also crucial to discuss the issue of relapse.

Clinical examination showed predominantly follicular pinpoint papules on trunk and proximal extremities and a biopsy showed a slightly dilated hair follicle with a focal disruption of the infundibular follicular epithelium. Other diseases related with perforating folliculitis were ruled out. The temporary relationship between the treatment and the appearance of the lesions suggests some pathogenic role of nilotinib.

However, because Navitoclax has a low binding affinity to Mcl-1, anticancer activity by Navitoclax is often attenuated by the elevated expression of Mcl-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other cancers, posing a serious problem for its potential clinical utilities. Therefore, approaches that suppress the expression of Mcl-1 are urgently needed to overcome Navitoclax-resistance in these cancers. Here, we reported that aspirin markedly suppressed Mcl-1 expression, and significantly enhanced Navitoclax-mediated cell viability inhibition and apoptosis induction in HCC cells. We further showed that aspirin robustly enhanced Navitoclax-triggered cytosolic cytochrome c release, activation of initiator caspase-9 and effector caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. Importantly, the cell death induction by the combination could be rescued by a cell-permeable caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK, indicative of an indispensable role of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway during the combination effect. Taken together, our study suggests that aspirin can be used to enhance Navitoclax-mediated anticancer activity via suppression of Mcl-1. Since aspirin is one of the most commonly used medicines, our findings therefore have translational impacts on Navitoclax-based therapy for HCC.","['Li, Gongquan', 'Zhang, Shuijun', 'Fang, Hongbo', 'Yan, Bing', 'Zhao, Yongfu', 'Feng, Liushun', 'Ma, Xiuxian', 'Ye, Xuexiang']","['Li G', 'Zhang S', 'Fang H', 'Yan B', 'Zhao Y', 'Feng L', 'Ma X', 'Ye X']","['Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130420,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)00644-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 May 17;434(4):809-14. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.018.

Imatinib, a front-line therapy for both chronic myeloid leukemia and of gastrointestinal stromal tumours, is often substantially metabolised via N-demethylation to the significantly less active CGP74588. Since deuterium-carbon bonds are stronger than hydrogen-carbon bonds, we hypothesised that the N-trideuteromethyl analogue of imatinib might be subject to a reduced metabolic turnover as compared to imatinib and lead to different pharmacokinetic properties, and hence improved efficacy, in vivo. Consequently, we investigated whether the N-trideuteromethyl analogue would maintain target inhibition and show a reduced propensity for N-demethylation in in vitro assays with liver microsomes and following oral administration to rats. The N-trideuteromethyl compound exhibited similar activity as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as imatinib and similar efficacy as an antiproliferative in cellular assays. In comparison to imatinib, the trideuterated analogue also showed reduced N-demethylation upon incubation with both rat and human liver microsomes, consistent with a deuterium isotope effect. However, the reduced in vitro metabolism did not translate into increased exposure of the N-trideuteromethyl analogue following intravenous administration of the compound to rats and no significant difference was observed for the formation of the N-desmethyl metabolite from either parent drug.","['Manley, Paul W', 'Blasco, Francesca', 'Mestan, Jurgen', 'Aichholz, Reiner']","['Manley PW', 'Blasco F', 'Mestan J', 'Aichholz R']","['Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland. paul.manley@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130401,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Benzamides/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biotransformation', 'Deuterium', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Rats']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(13)00254-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2013 Jun 1;21(11):3231-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.038.

There has not been a large population-based study that has examined cytogenetic features and outcomes of AML in Australia. AIM: Investigation of epidemiological, prognostic, treatment and outcome data in adults diagnosed with AML in Western Australia between 1991 and 2005. METHODS: Patients were identified utilising the Western Australia Cancer Registry, cytogenetic databases and hospital inpatient discharge diagnoses. Data were retrospectively collected from patients presenting to tertiary hospitals on patient characteristics, karyotype, induction therapy, remission, transplantation and survival. RESULTS: A total of 987 patients with AML was identified, of which 91% (898) attended a tertiary hospital. Median age was 67 years and 45% of cases represented secondary AML. Cytogenetic analysis was available in 81% of patients. Frequent karyotypes were normal (38.8%), complex (13.8%) and -7/add(7q)/del(7q) (12.1%). Aggressive therapy was initiated in 62.6%. Less than 15% were enrolled in clinical trials. Overall 16.5% received a stem cell transplant. Median overall survival for all patients was 5.6 months. In patients treated aggressively, complete remission was achieved in 56.9% and median overall survival was 12.2 months. Age, secondary disease and karyotype were significantly predictive of remission and overall survival. CONCLUSION: Age distribution, remission and survival rates were comparable with published population-based studies. High median age was reflected in the rate of secondary AML and trial eligibility. These findings highlight the need for prospective data collection.","['Gangatharan, S A', 'Grove, C S', ""P'ng, S"", ""O'Reilly, J"", 'Joske, D', 'Leahy, M F', 'Threlfall, T', 'Wright, M P']","['Gangatharan SA', 'Grove CS', ""P'ng S"", ""O'Reilly J"", 'Joske D', 'Leahy MF', 'Threlfall T', 'Wright MP']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia. shane.gangatharan@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/trends', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Western Australia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2014/03/25 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imj.12169 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2013 Aug;43(8):903-11. doi: 10.1111/imj.12169.,8,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2013 The Authors; Internal Medicine Journal (c) 2013 Royal Australasian', 'College of Physicians.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Western Australia', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'cytogenetics', 'karyotype', 'population study', 'survival']",,,,,,,

The results showed that EEAC inhibited the proliferation of WEHI-3 cells, resulting in the accumulation of cell in G0/G1 and G2/M phases, as determined by flow cytometry. Moreover, EEAC markedly reduced the migration of WEHI-3 cells, as determined by a transwell assay. Treatment of WEHI-3 cells with EEAC also decreased MMP-9 protein expression and enzyme activity. The protein levels of p-Akt, p-ERK1/2 were also decreased, whereas the expression of p21 and p27 was increased. Furthermore, in an in vivo model, EEAC treatment reduced the infiltration of WEHI-3 cells into the liver and spleens and decreased tumor growth. Other bioactive compounds, such as cordycepin and zhankuic acid A, have been demonstrated to reduce the expression of MMP-9, cyclin E, cyclin D1 and to increase the expression of p21, p27. This is the first study to investigate that the mechanisms by which EEAC reduce the proliferation and migration of WEHI-3 cells in vitro, as well as the ability of EEAC to reduced infiltration of WEHI-3 cells into the liver and spleen in vivo.

The recycled iron is delivered to erythroid precursors for erythropoiesis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether ferritin is highly expressed in macrophages and erythroid precursors, and whether it can be used as a marker for these two cell types. METHODS AND RESULTS: A ferritin monoclonal antibody was developed, and immunohistochemistry was performed. In normal bone marrows, ferritin antibody stained early erythroid precursors and macrophages. In contrast, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells and megakaryocytes lacked ferritin expression. In leukaemic bone marrows, ferritin was selectively expressed in erythroid blasts (M6), whereas all other blasts were negative. In lymph nodes, ferritin was highly and specifically expressed in macrophages, whereas lymphocytes completely lacked ferritin expression. In non-haematopoietic tissues, ferritin antibody highlighted alveolar macrophages in the lung, as well as sinus macrophages in the liver and spleen. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ferritin is a novel and reliable marker for macrophages and early erythroid precursors, and may be of clinical utility in the diagnosis of diseases associated with these two cell types.","['Wang, Wei', 'Grier, David D', 'Woo, Jennifer', 'Ward, Martha', 'Sui, Guangchao', 'Torti, Suzy V', 'Torti, Frank M', 'Beaty, Michael W']","['Wang W', 'Grier DD', 'Woo J', 'Ward M', 'Sui G', 'Torti SV', 'Torti FM', 'Beaty MW']","['Department of Pathology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Apoferritins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/his.12101 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2013 May;62(6):931-40. doi: 10.1111/his.12101.,6,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9013-31-4 (Apoferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The expressions of microRNAs in common-ALL patients were detected by microarrays in 3 pediatric common-ALL samples, and then verified by stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR in 34 common-ALL samples. The target genes of miR-708 were found by bioinformatics software, and verified by dual-luciferases reporter assay, RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Compared to normal bone marrow samples, of all the 2006 detected miRNAs, the expression of miR-708, miR-181b and miR-210 were 16.886 +/- 16.854, 5.710 +/- 4.652, and 9.789 +/- 1.178, retrospectively, being significantly up-regulated expressed than those in normal control (1.872 +/- 0.339, 1.276 +/- 0.531 and 1.005 +/- 0.080, retrospectively) (P < 0.05), while miR-27b and miR-345 were the two most down-regulated ones (0.524 +/- 0.085 and 0.675 +/- 0.086, retrospectively) (normal control: 1.123 +/- 0.066 and 1.204 +/- 0.140, retrospectively) (P < 0.05). And the expression of miR-708 and miR-181b were significantly correlated with the clinical types in common-ALL. In high risk common-ALL, miR-708 and miR-181b were much higher than in standard and middle risk common-ALL (P < 0.05). The further verification research in 293 cell line showed that miR-708 decreased the expression level of its target genes CNTFR, NNAT and GNG12 by combining with 3'-UTR of the 3 genes, moreover, miR-708 combined with CNTFR 3'-UTR in 394 approximately 400 bp sequence region.

METHODS: Between January 2004 and December 2011, Bone marrow (BM) samples from 640 patients with de novo AML were analyzed retrospectively. The analyses were performed according to standard culturing and banding techniques, and clonal abnormalities were defined and described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN 2009). The cytogenetic subtypes were performed as normal, balanced, and unbalanced karyotypes. In the last group, the age distribution of complex and monosome karyotypes were further analyzed. The patients were divided into 8 age groups: 0 - 9, 10 - 19, 20 - 29, 30 - 39, 40 - 49, 50 - 59, 60 - 69, and >/= 70 year old groups. RESULTS: The distribution of normal, balanced, and unbalanced karyotypes showed age specific characteristics. The incidence of normal karyotype increased from 6.67% (0 approximately 9 year old) to 58.33% (>/= 70) (chi(2) = 20.68, P = 0.001) and balanced karyotype decreased from 73.33% (0 approximately 9) to 11.11% (>/= 70) (chi(2) = 48.22, P < 0.01).

METHODS: Twenty-two patients with refractory aGVHD received the treatment of first- and/or second-line immunosuppressive agents in combination with MSCs. The MSCs from bone marrow (BM) of HLA-unrelated third-party donors, were used at the median time of 19 (11 - 49) days after aGVHD onset, at a dose of 1x10(6)/kg once with an interval of 14 days. If the symptoms of aGVHD did not improve after continuous infusion four times, MSCs would be discontinued. Meanwhile the proportion of CD3(+)CD4(+), CD3(+)CD8(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+) was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) before and 4 weeks after the MSCs infusion. RESULTS: The median dose of MSC was 4.8 (2.5 - 6.3)x10(6) cellxkg(-1) with a median infusion of 2.5 (1 - 7) times per case. Twelve patients achieved complete response (CR), four partial response (PR) after treatment. The total effective rate was 72.7% (16/22). With a median follow-up of 246.5 (36 - 1116) days post-transplantation, 11 patients survived and 11 died. The causes of death included GVHD(n = 6), infections (n = 3), leukemia relapse (n = 1) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (n = 1), respectively. The proportion of CD3(+)CD4(+)/CD3(+)CD8(+) was significantly higher at 4th week after MSCs infusion compared to before infusion (1.58 +/- 0.54 vs 0.49 +/- 0.19, \%t\% = 0.628, P = 0.04). The number of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells had not changed much compared to before infusion (P = 0.606). CONCLUSION: MSCs derived from the BM of a third-party donor are effective to treat aGVHD failed to second-line immunosuppressive therapy after allo-HSCT.

METHODS: Ten hospitals in China took part in the four times of sample exchange and comparisons from April, 2010 to August, 2011. The exchange samples were prepared by Peking University People's Hospital. Firstly, the BCR-ABL (P210)(+) cells from a newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia patient were 10-fold serially diluted by BCR-ABL (P210)(-) cells and they covered 4 magnitudes. Then, TRIzol reagents were thoroughly mixed with cells in each tube. Every 12 samples (three samples per magnitude) were sent to the other 9 hospitals. The cell number of each sample was 8x10(6). The detection of bcr-abl transcript levels by real-time quantitative PCR were performed in every hospital according to their own protocols. Conversion factors (CF) were calculated using regression equation. RESULTS: Differences in bcr-abl transcript levels did exist among results of 10 hospitals in each comparison. In general, the results of the most of hospitals were in line with the dilutions of cells. CF of every hospital fluctuated. Three hospitals had relatively stable CF, and their ranges were 2.8 - 5.2, 1.2 - 2.8 and 2.2 - 6.8, respectively; two hospitals had unstable CF with ranges 0.76 - 7.0 and 2.1 - 18.7; three hospitals couldn't be calculated CF one or two times because of the significant deviation of the results from the actually bcr-abl transcript levels, and their ranges of CF which could be calculated were 1.9 - 19.2, 3.6 - 7.6 and 0.18 - 14.7; One hospital only had two CF (3.3 and 5.0) because of the replacement of an important reagent during the period of comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Comparability of bcr-abl (P210) transcript levels between different hospitals could be achieved through CF which acquired by sample exchange and comparison. The stable and reliable detection system is the premise to acquire correct CF.","['Qin, Ya-zhen', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Cen, Jian-nong', 'Geng, Su-xia', 'Li, Qing-hua', 'Li, Xiao-qing', 'Lin, Zhen-xing', 'Ma, Dao-xin', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Wang, Yun-gui', 'Li, Jin-lan', 'Li, Ling-di', 'Huang, Xiao-jun']","['Qin YZ', 'Cheng H', 'Cen JN', 'Geng SX', 'Li QH', 'Li XQ', 'Lin ZX', 'Ma DX', 'Qiao C', 'Wang YG', 'Li JL', 'Li LD', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology Beijing, 100044.""]",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'China', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Feb;34(2):104-8.,2,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Immunophenotyping and NPM1 gene mutation type-A, B and D and other leukemic related fusion genes were detected by multiparameter flow cytometry and real time RT-PCR or PCR, respectively. 104 AML patients with NPM1m(+)AML and performed immunophenotyping assay were included, 97 with NPM1m(-)AML. RESULTS: There were significant difference between the two groups at presentation in terms of sex, white blood count(WBC), platelet counts (PLT), blast ratio, normal karyotype ratio, WT1 expression level, FLT3-ITD mutation positive rate and remission rate of first course of induction therapy (P < 0.05). On the immunophenotype, the expression of early differentiation antigens (CD34, HLA-DR, CD117, CD38), lymphocytic antigens (CD7, CD4, CD19, CD2), myeloid and monocytic differentiation-associated antigens (CD13, CD14, CD15) were lower, and that of CD33 as well as CD123 were higher in NPM1m(+)AML patients. Among them, only CD34, HLA-DR, CD7, and CD4 positive cases were significantly lower in NPM1m(+)AML group than in NPM1m(-)AML group (P < 0.05), the rest of them had significant difference in the number of positive cells (P < 0.05). Above features were further analyzed between the M1/M2 and M4/M5 subgroups. M1/M2 cases retained the women prominent and had a higher WT1 expression level (P < 0.05). The expression of monocytic differentiation-associated antigens including HLA-DR and lymphocytic antigens were higher and that of CD117 were lower in M4/M5 subtype (P < 0.05). Among them, the positive rates of HLA-DR, CD64, CD11b, CD10, CD15, and CD4 were significantly higher in M4/M5 than in M1/M2 in NPM1m(+)AML group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The most clinical characteristics in NPM1m(+)AML patients are consistent with reports, but some immunophenotype are different to the previous reports under similar FAB subtypes constituent ratio. The major immunophenotypic features of NPM1m(+)AML patients are lower expression of progenitor, myeloid and lymphoid lineage antigens. Monocytic differentiation-associated antigens are only higher expression in M4/M5 cases when comparison with M1/M2 cases within NPM1m(+)AML group.","['Liu, Yan-rong', 'Chang, Yan', 'Ruan, Guo-rui', 'Qin, Ya-zhen', 'Lai, Yue-yun', 'Shi, Hong-xia', 'Wang, Ya-zhe', 'Li, Ling-di', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Li, Jin-lan']","['Liu YR', 'Chang Y', 'Ruan GR', 'Qin YZ', 'Lai YY', 'Shi HX', 'Wang YZ', 'Li LD', 'Jiang B', 'Li JL']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing 100044, China. yrliu163@163.com""]",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Feb;34(2):98-103.,2,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 37 CML-CP patients were randomized to receive dasatinib 100 mg orally daily or imatinib 400 mg orally daily. The efficacy and safety data were collected and compared. RESULTS: Of 37 CML-CP patients, 18 received dasatinib and 19 received imatinib. The both of median duration of drug therapy and follow-up were 38 months. (1) The rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months was higher in dasatinib group than in imatinib group (89% vs 68%), but there was no significantly statistic significance between two groups (P = 0.232). The cumulative CCyR rate by 36 months was 89% in both arms. The major molecular response (MMR) at 18 months was 76% in dasatinib arm, being significantly higher than that in imatinib arm (37%) (P = 0.017). The cumulative MMR rate by 36 months was 82% versus 68% in dasatinib or imatinib (P = 0.694). The median time to CCyR and MMR was significantly faster for dasatinib than for imatinib (3 months vs. 6 months, and 14 months vs. 34 months, respectively). (2) The drug-related adverse events were mostly grade 1/2 and were well-tolerated. Increase of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, pleural effusion and thrombocytopenia were more common in dasatinib arm, while hypophosphatemia, edema and neutropenia were more common in imatinib arm.

METHODS: CEM-C1 cells were cultured in vitro and treated with rapamycin at different concentrations with or without 1 mumol/L dexamethasone (Dex). 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test was performed to assess cell proliferation. The cell cycle and cell apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of GRalpha mRNA was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of GR, p-70S6K, Mcl-1, and Bim proteins was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: When incubated with rapamycin at different concentrations, CEM-C1 cells showed significant growth inhibition in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The growth inhibition was synergistically increased when CEM-C1 cells were treated with rapamycin plus 1 mumol/L Dex. CEM-C1 cells treated with rapamycin alone showed no apparent apoptosis, and were arrested at G0/G1 phase. After the treatment with Dex plus rapamycin, CEM-C1 cells demonstrated apparent apoptosis and increased the cell cycle arrested at G0/G1 phase. Rapamycin combined with Dex up-regulated GRalpha, phosphorylated GR(p-GR), and pro-apoptotic protein Bim-EL in CEM-C1 cells, but inhibited the expression of p-p70S6K, a downstream target protein of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). CONCLUSION: After the treatment with rapamycin plus Dex, Dex resistant CEM-C1 cells induce growth inhibition and apoptosis. The underlying mechanism may involve inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway and also be associated with up-regulation of GR expression and activation of GC-GR signaling pathway.","['Guo, Xia', 'Zhou, Chen Yan', 'Li, Qiang', 'Gao, Ju', 'Zhu, Yi Ping', 'Gu, Ling', 'Ma, Zhi Gui']","['Guo X', 'Zhou CY', 'Li Q', 'Gao J', 'Zhu YP', 'Gu L', 'Ma ZG']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Biomed Environ Sci,Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,8909524,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",,2013/04/25 06:00,2013/08/08 06:00,['2013/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3967/0895-3988.2013.05.006 [doi]', 'S0895-3988(13)60018-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomed Environ Sci. 2013 May;26(5):371-81. doi: 10.3967/0895-3988.2013.05.006.,5,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.', 'Published by China CDC.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings. Study aims were to assess subjective well-being (SWB), psychological distress, and school contentment in survivors of three dissimilar childhood cancers. Patients and methods: Nordic patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), infratentorial astrocytoma (IA), and Wilms tumor (WT) in childhood from 1985 to 2001, aged >/=1 year at diagnosis, and aged 13-18 years at the time of study were eligible for this questionnaire-based survey that included items on SWB, psychological distress, school contentment, self-esteem, and personality traits; 65% (151/231) responded. An age-equivalent group from a Norwegian health survey (n=7910) served as controls. Results: The median age of ACCSs was 16 years; 52% were males. ACCSs reported better SWB (p=0.004) and self-esteem (p<0.001). They had fewer social problems in school (p=0.004) and their school contentment tended to be higher than controls. SWB and school contentment were positively influenced by self-esteem. However, ACCSs reported higher levels of psychological distress (p=0.002), mostly attributable to general worrying. No significant differences in outcomes were found across diagnoses, and time since diagnosis did not significantly affect the results. Conclusion: The overall emotional functioning of ACCSs was good, possibly due to changes in their perception of well-being after having survived a life-threatening disease. However, they seemed more worried than their peers. This may cause an additional strain at a vulnerable period in life.","['Johannsdottir, Inga M', 'Moum, Torbjorn', 'Hjermstad, Marianne J', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Schroder, Henrik', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Jonmundsson, Gudmundur', 'Loge, Jon H']","['Johannsdottir IM', 'Moum T', 'Hjermstad MJ', 'Wesenberg F', 'Hjorth L', 'Schroder H', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Jonmundsson G', 'Loge JH']","['National Resource Center for Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital , Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,,PMC3621515,2011/09/01 00:00,2011/09/01 00:01,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1089/jayao.2011.0019 [doi]', '10.1089/jayao.2011.0019 [pii]']",ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2011 Sep;1(3):133-139. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2011.0019.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is particularly true for ALL in older children, adolescents, and adults, in whom treatment outcomes are markedly inferior to those of young children. A major goal of current leukemia research is to use comprehensive genomic analysis of the leukemic cell genome, transcriptome, and epigenome to identify critical new genomic alterations that drive leukemogenesis and influence responsiveness to therapy. Genomic analyses in childhood ALL have been remarkably informative and have identified a number of new structural genetic alterations that play important roles in the establishment of the leukemic clone and determine risk of relapse. Notably, many high-risk ALL cases harbor loss-of-function and dominant mutations of genes that encode transcriptional regulators of lymphoid development coupled with mutations that result in activation of cytokine receptor and kinase signaling pathways. These advances have resulted in new diagnostic approaches and therapeutic trials in ALL. This review will discuss these advances and outline challenges for future studies, including the potential role of genome-wide sequencing approaches and the need for detailed studies of the genetics of ALL in the adolescent and young adult population.","['Mullighan, Charles G', 'Willman, Cheryl L']","['Mullighan CG', 'Willman CL']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,,PMC3621335,2011/06/01 00:00,2011/06/01 00:01,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1089/jayao.2011.0012 [doi]', '10.1089/jayao.2011.0012 [pii]']",ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2011 Jun;1(2):77-86. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2011.0012.,2,,,,,['U01 CA157937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis (also known as 'BCR-ABL1-negative' MPNs), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are the primary types of MPNs. After the discovery of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein in CML, several oncogenic tyrosine kinases have been identified in 'BCR-ABL1-negative' MPNs, most importantly, JAK2V617F mutation. The similarity in the clinical characteristics of the BCR-ABL1-negative MPN patients along with the prevalence of the Janus kinase mutation in this patient population provided a strong rationale for the development of a new class of pharmacologic inhibitors that target this pathway. The first of its class, ruxolitinib, has now been approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) for the management of patients with intermediate- to high-risk myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib provides significant and sustained improvements in spleen related and constitutional symptoms secondary to the disease. Although noncurative, ruxolitinib represents a milestone in the treatment of myelofibrosis patients. Other types of JAK2 inhibitors are being tested in various clinical trials at this point and may provide better efficacy data and safety profile than its predecessor.

METHOD: A literature search of the PubMed database (1996-April 2012) using the search terms clofarabine and acute myeloid leukemia was performed. All relevant English language articles were reviewed. Clinical trials with patients aged 50 years or older diagnosed with AML were included. RESULTS: Two studies evaluating clofarabine as monotherapy and five studies evaluating clofarabine in combination with cytarabine were reviewed. Clofarabine demonstrated activity in older adults with AML. Response rates and median overall survival (OS) for patients receiving clofarabine were similar to those for patients receiving conventional induction chemotherapy. The induction mortality rate with clofarabine was lower than that seen with intensive chemotherapy. However, clofarabine was associated with a significant risk of severe complications including myelosuppression and sepsis. CONCLUSION: Clofarabine is an active agent for the treatment of older patients with AML as a single agent or in combination therapy. Based on published data and side-effect profiles, clofarabine may be an appropriate alternative to intensive chemotherapy for older patients with AML, offering similar response rates to traditional 7+3 chemotherapy with potentially decreased induction mortality. The use of clofarabine in combination with newer agents including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors like decitabine is a promising approach for older patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to directly compare the efficacy of clofarabine as a single agent and in combination therapy compared with intensive chemotherapy regimens.","['Tiley, Stephen', 'Claxton, David']","['Tiley S', 'Claxton D']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Est Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3629760,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/04/24 06:01,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620712461666 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620712461666 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2013 Feb;4(1):5-13. doi: 10.1177/2040620712461666.,1,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clofarabine', 'older adults']",,,,,,,

Gata1 and Tal1 can assemble within higher-order protein complexes (Ldb1 complexes) that include the adapter molecules Lmo2 and Ldb1. Ldb1 proteins are capable of coassociation, and long-range Ldb1-mediated oligomerization of enhancer- and promoter-bound Ldb1 complexes has been shown to be required for beta-globin gene expression. In this study, we generated a genomewide map of Ldb1 complex binding sites that revealed widespread binding at erythroid genes and at known erythroid enhancer elements. Ldb1 complex binding sites frequently colocalized with Klf1 binding sites and with consensus binding motifs for other erythroid transcription factors. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between Ldb1 complex binding and Ldb1 dependency for gene expression and identified a large cohort of genes coregulated by Ldb1 complexes and Klf1.

The UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) polymorphism UGT1A1*28 (*28)/*28 has been linked to an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia in patients with CML who receive nilotinib. Beside *28, UGT1A1*6 (*6) is another important variant allele in Japanese patients because it is associated with adverse events of irinotecan, metabolized by UGT1A1. We retrospectively investigated the association between severe toxicity of nilotinib and UGT1A1 polymorphisms (*6 and*28) in Japanese patients with CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with cytogenetically confirmed CML who were receiving nilotinib were studied to explore the association of UGT1A1 polymorphisms with severe nilotinib-related toxicity. Genotyping analyses were determined for *6 and *28. RESULTS: All 3 patients with the *6/*6 or *6/*28 genotype had severe toxicity, including QT interval prolongation (grade 3), elevated lipase levels (grade 3) plus hyperbilirubinemia (grade 2), and anemia (grade 3) plus hepatic cyst hemorrhage (grade 2) in 1 patient each. Among the 5 patients with the *6/*1 or *1/*1 genotype, 1 had elevated lipase levels (grade 3) and another had severe pain in the lower extremities (grade 3).

It is unclear what DNA lesions are caused by 5-azadC and if such are substrates for DNA repair. Here, we identify that 5-azadC induces DNA damage as measured by gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 foci. Furthermore, 5-azadC induces radial chromosomes and chromatid breaks that depend on active replication, which altogether suggest that trapped DNMT collapses oncoming replication forks into double-strand breaks. We demonstrate that RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (HR) is activated to repair 5-azadC collapsed replication forks. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, and deaths are often associated with leukemia. Here, we show that FANCG-deficient cells fail to trigger HR-mediated repair of 5-azadC-induced lesions, leading to accumulation of chromatid breaks and inter-chromosomal radial fusions as well as hypersensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of 5-azadC. These data demonstrate that the FA pathway is important to protect from 5-azadC-induced toxicity. Altogether, our data demonstrate that cytotoxicity of the epigenetic drug 5-azadC can, at least in part, be explained by collapsed replication forks requiring FA-mediated HR for repair.","['Orta, Manuel Luis', 'Calderon-Montano, Jose Manuel', 'Dominguez, Inmaculada', 'Pastor, Nuria', 'Burgos-Moron, Estefania', 'Lopez-Lazaro, Miguel', 'Cortes, Felipe', 'Mateos, Santiago', 'Helleday, Thomas']","['Orta ML', 'Calderon-Montano JM', 'Dominguez I', 'Pastor N', 'Burgos-Moron E', 'Lopez-Lazaro M', 'Cortes F', 'Mateos S', 'Helleday T']","['Department of Cell Biology, Cell Culture and Radiobiology Research Group, University of Seville, 41012 Seville, Spain. morta2@us.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130422,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatids/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Breaks', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein/*physiology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Recombinational DNA Repair']",PMC3675485,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt270 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt270 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jun;41(11):5827-36. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt270.

This study examines the effects of ponatinib on cardiac repolarization in patients with refractory hematological malignancies enrolled in a phase 1 trial. METHODS: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected at 3 dose levels (30, 45, and 60 mg) at 6 time points. Electrocardiographic parameters, including QTc interval, were measured, and 11 morphological analyses were conducted. Central tendency analyses of ECG parameters were performed using time-point and time-averaged approaches. All patients with at least 2 baseline ECGs and 1 on-treatment ECG were included in the analyses. Patients with paired ECGs and plasma samples were included in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis to examine the relationship between ponatinib plasma concentration and change from baseline in QT intervals.

There was no significant effect on cardiac repolarization, as evidenced by non-clinically significant mean QTcF changes from baseline of -10.9, -3.6, and -5.0 ms for the 30-, 45-, and 60-mg dose levels, respectively. The morphological analysis revealed 2 patients with atrial fibrillation and 2 with T wave inversion. Seventy-five patients were included in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis across all dose levels. The slope of the relationship for QTcF versus plasma ponatinib concentration was not positive (-0.0171), indicating no exposure-effect relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib is associated with a low risk of QTc prolongation in patients with refractory hematological malignancies.","['Sonnichsen, Daryl', 'Dorer, David J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Bixby, Dale', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Litwin, Jeffrey', 'Turner, Christopher D', 'Haluska, Frank G']","['Sonnichsen D', 'Dorer DJ', 'Cortes J', 'Talpaz M', 'Deininger MW', 'Shah NP', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Bixby D', 'Mauro MJ', 'Flinn IW', 'Litwin J', 'Turner CD', 'Haluska FG']","['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 26 Landsdowne St., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130423,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Long QT Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use']",PMC3668123,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/08/02 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-013-2160-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2013 Jun;71(6):1599-607. doi: 10.1007/s00280-013-2160-7.

However, the overall view of erythroid differentiation remains unclear. First, we screened for erythroid differentiation-related genes by comparing the expression profiles of high differentiation-inducible and low differentiation-inducible murine erythroleukemia cells. We identified that overexpression of alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) inhibits hemoglobin production. FUT8 catalyzes the transfer of a fucose residue to N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins via an alpha-1,6 linkage, leading to core fucosylation in mammals. Expression of Fut8 was down-regulated during chemically induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells. Additionally, expression of Fut8 was positively regulated by c-Myc and c-Myb, which are known as suppressors of erythroid differentiation. Second, we found that FUT8 is the only fucosyltransferase family member that inhibits hemoglobin production. Functional analysis of FUT8 revealed that the donor substrate-binding domain and a flexible loop play essential roles in inhibition of hemoglobin production. This result clearly demonstrates that core fucosylation inhibits hemoglobin production. Third, FUT8 also inhibited hemoglobin production of human erythroleukemia K562 cells. Finally, a short hairpin RNA study showed that FUT8 down-regulation induced hemoglobin production and increase of transferrin receptor/glycophorin A-positive cells in human erythroleukemia K562 cells. Our findings define FUT8 as a novel factor for hemoglobin production and demonstrate that core fucosylation plays an important role in erythroid differentiation.","['Sasaki, Hitoshi', 'Toda, Takanori', 'Furukawa, Toru', 'Mawatari, Yuki', 'Takaesu, Rika', 'Shimizu, Masashi', 'Wada, Ryohei', 'Kato, Dai', 'Utsugi, Takahiko', 'Ohtsu, Masaya', 'Murakami, Yasufumi']","['Sasaki H', 'Toda T', 'Furukawa T', 'Mawatari Y', 'Takaesu R', 'Shimizu M', 'Wada R', 'Kato D', 'Utsugi T', 'Ohtsu M', 'Murakami Y']","['Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585; Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585; Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585; Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585; Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585; Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585; Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585; Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585.', 'Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101; Bio Matrix Research Inc., Chiba 270-0101, Japan.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585.', 'Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo 125-8585; Genome and Drug Research Center, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 270-0101; Bio Matrix Research Inc., Chiba 270-0101, Japan.

In the present report, we describe three new cases of AML associated with FGFR1 abnormalities: AML with minimal differentiation with 45,XY,-7,t(8;13)(p11.2;q12), acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia with 48,XY,t(8;9)(p11.2;q33),+19,+21, and AML with minimal differentiation with 46,XX,add(8)(p11.2). FGFR1 abnormalities were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We reviewed the records of 19 patients reported from Asian countries, and found that approximately 40 % of cases manifested as acute leukemia associated with myeloid lineage, and 47 % were not accompanied with eosinophilia. These findings highlight the need for detection of FGFR1 abnormalities, not only in myeloproliferative disorder, but also in AML patients even without eosinophilia. The prognosis for this group of neoplasms is poor, and there is no recognized effective targeted treatment. Two patients, including our case, who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) survived. Accumulation of long-term follow-up data can help determine the allo-HSCT protocol or the need for new therapeutic trials to improve the survival rate of patients with FGFR1 abnormalities.","['Lee, Hyeyoung', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Lim, Jihyang', 'Kim, Yonggoo', 'Han, Kyungja', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Lee H', 'Kim M', 'Lim J', 'Kim Y', 'Han K', 'Cho BS', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20130423,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1337-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Jun;97(6):808-12. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1337-5.

TA targets specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors that mediate the expression of several genes associated with cancer including survivin, a key member of inhibitor of apoptosis protein family. Our aim was to test the anti-leukemic efficacy of TA in pre-clinical experiments. The anti-leukemic response of TA was determined using Jurkat and Nalm-6 cell lines. Cells were treated with increasing (25/50/75 muM) concentrations of TA, and cell viability was measured at 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment. TA showed a steady and consistent decrease in cell viability following a clear dose and time dependent response. Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry. Results showed a significant increase in the apoptotic fraction (annexin V positive) following TA treatment, while cell cycle phase distribution analysis showed G0/G1 arrest. TA-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by examining the activation of caspase 3/7 and the expression of cleaved PARP. TA modulated the expression of critical candidates associated with the early phases of cell cycle and validated its efficacy in causing G0/G1 arrest. The Western blot results revealed that TA significantly decreases Sp1 and survivin expression. These results demonstrate that the anti-leukemic response of TA occurs potentially through targeting Sp1 and inhibiting survivin and suggest the efficacy of TA as a novel therapeutic agent for leukemia.","['Sutphin, Robert M', 'Connelly, Sarah F', 'Lee, Chris M', 'Sankpal, Umesh T', 'Eslin, Don', 'Khan, Moeez', 'Pius, Hima', 'Basha, Riyaz']","['Sutphin RM', 'Connelly SF', 'Lee CM', 'Sankpal UT', 'Eslin D', 'Khan M', 'Pius H', 'Basha R']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center Orlando, Orlando, FL, 32806, USA, Robert.Sutphin@orlandohealth.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130423,France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Survivin', 'ortho-Aminobenzoates/*pharmacology']",,2013/04/24 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11523-013-0274-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Target Oncol. 2014 Jun;9(2):135-44. doi: 10.1007/s11523-013-0274-9.

METHODS: We reviewed the records of a consecutive series of 21 patients with HAU who were followed up for more than 12 months at Hokkaido University Hospital. RESULTS: Of the 21 patients enrolled in this study, 19 as well as their parents (90.5 %) were born in Hokkaido. One patient was a member of the Ainu ethnic group. Unilateral involvement was found in 16 cases (76 %). In the ophthalmological examinations, vitreous opacity was most frequently followed by keratic precipitate, iris/gonio nodules, and posterior synechiae, while hypopyon, retinal vasculitis, and neovascularization were rarely observed. Intraocular inflammation was controlled by topical treatment, while systemic corticosteroids were required in less than one-fourth of patients. Visual acuity improved in 15 patients, remained unchanged in four patients, and deteriorated in two patients. HAU was observed in two patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Three out of the four patients (75 %) for whom HLA typing was available had HLA-A26. CONCLUSIONS: A number of clinical features were unique to Hokkaido, namely, predominant unilateral involvement, as well as two HAU patients with ATLL.

To investigate the underlying mechanisms for the highly malignant phenotype of 17p- CLL and to facilitate in vivo evaluation of potential drugs against CLL with p53 deletion, we have generated a mouse model with TCL1-Tg:p53(-/-) genotype. These mice develop B-cell leukemia at an early age with an early appearance of CD5+ / IgM+ B cells in the peritoneal cavity and spleen, and exhibit an aggressive path of disease development and drug resistance phenotype similar to human CLL with 17p deletion. The TCL1-Tg:p53(-/-) leukemia cells exhibit higher survival capacity and are more drug resistant than the leukemia cells from TCL1-Tg:p53wt mice. Analysis of microRNA expression reveals that p53 deletion resulted in a decrease of miR-15a and miR-16-1, leading to an elevated expression of Mcl-1. Primary leukemia cells from CLL patients with 17p deletion also show a decrease in miR-15a/miR-16-1 and an increase in Mcl-1. Our study suggests that the p53/miR15a/16-1/Mcl-1 axis may be an important pathway that regulates Mcl-1 expression and contributes to drug resistance and aggressive phenotype in CLL cells with loss of p53.","['Liu, J', 'Chen, G', 'Feng, L', 'Zhang, W', 'Pelicano, H', 'Wang, F', 'Ogasawara, M A', 'Lu, W', 'Amin, H M', 'Croce, C M', 'Keating, M J', 'Huang, P']","['Liu J', 'Chen G', 'Feng L', 'Zhang W', 'Pelicano H', 'Wang F', 'Ogasawara MA', 'Lu W', 'Amin HM', 'Croce CM', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['1] Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', '1] Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA [3] State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130423,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Disease Models, Animal', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",PMC3806892,2013/04/24 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013125 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.125 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jan;28(1):118-28. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.125.

Although younger age and cytogenetic profiles of t(8;21) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) subtypes of AML are associated with improved survival, these factors have not been investigated by race. The purpose is to evaluate whether the observed survival differences for blacks and Hispanics with AML are attributable to older age at diagnosis or lower rates of favorable cytogenetic profiles at diagnosis. The hypothesis is that survival disparities for blacks and Hispanics with AML will be explained by older age at diagnosis and lower rates of favorable cytogenetics. METHODS: Patients with AML were identified in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (1999 to 2008). Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves predicted survival by race/ethnicity, stratified by age. Cox proportional hazard models estimated mortality by race with adjustment for age, sex, year of diagnosis, t(8;21), and APL subtypes. RESULTS: A total of 25,692 patients were included. Blacks and Hispanics were diagnosed at younger ages (younger than 61 y), and had higher rates of t(8;21) and APL compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). The overall KM curve shows that NHWs had a worse survival compared with other races/ethnicities. However, when KM curves were stratified by age, blacks and Hispanics had worse survival in younger age categories (younger than 61 y). In multivariable models, black race was associated with an increased risk of death compared with NHWs (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.16). Adjustment for t(8;21) and APL subtypes did not attenuate the disparity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite younger age and higher prevalence of favorable cytogenetics at diagnosis, blacks and Hispanics have an increased mortality from AML compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Future studies should investigate other factors that may influence outcomes among minority populations.","['Patel, Manali I', 'Ma, Yifei', 'Mitchell, Beverly S', 'Rhoads, Kim F']","['Patel MI', 'Ma Y', 'Mitchell BS', 'Rhoads KF']","['Departments of *Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology daggerSurgery, School of Medicine, Stanford University double daggerStanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['Adult', 'African Americans', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Healthcare Disparities/*ethnology', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/24 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/COC.0b013e31828d7536 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2015 Apr;38(2):159-64. doi: 10.1097/COC.0b013e31828d7536.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These polymorphisms may lead to abnormal expression and dysfunction of the corresponding transcription factors and are likely to increase the risk of ALL. To validate the relationship between these SNPs and the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese population, we conducted a case-control study of 570 ALL cases and 673 controls. We determined that the SNP rs10821936 in ARID5B was statistically significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL (P<0.0001). The results were also significant for the subgroup analysis of high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk ALL as well as B-lineage ALL. Statistically significant differences were not found in the SNPs for IKZF1 and CEBPE.

METHODS: Forty-six children with AL were divided into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) groups. Fifteen children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura were selected as a control group. The mRNA expression of HOXA9 was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: HOXA9 expression was detected in 63% of the 52 bone marrow samples from 46 AL children. The positive HOXA9 expression rate in the AML group was significantly higher than in the ALL and control groups (86% vs 35% and 13%; P<0.05). The mRNA expression of HOXA9 in the AML group was significantly higher than in the ALL and control groups (P<0.05). Among the children with AML, those with M5 AML had the highest HOXA9 mRNA level, followed by children with M4 AML and children with M1 and/or M2 AML, but HOXA9 expression was not detected in children with M3 AML. The high-risk subgroup of AML children had relatively high levels of HOXA9 expression. In the children with AML, the initial treatment subgroup had significantly higher positive HOXA9 expression rate and HOXA9 mRNA levels than in the remission subgroup and control group (P<0.05), but there were no significant differences between the latter two groups (P>0.05). The non-remission subgroup had significantly higher HOXA9 expression than the remission subgroup and control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High expression of HOXA9 is associated with the occurrence of AL, and its expression level is significantly higher in children with AML than in those with ALL. There is a positive correlation between the expression level of HOXA9 and the risk of childhood leukemia, and high expression of HOXA9 suggests poor prognosis. Therefore, HOXA9 can be used as one of the indices in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis prediction of childhood AL.","['Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Zhu, Li-Ping', 'Li, Jian-Chang', 'Wang, Cui-Cui']","['Jia XH', 'Zhu LP', 'Li JC', 'Wang CC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong, China. jiaxiuhong001@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/08/09 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2013.04.006 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2013 Apr;15(4):268-72.,4,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical benefit of IVIG was assessed by comparing the incidence of bacterial infections before and after starting this therapy. Plasma immunoglobulin concentrations and relevant hematological variables were recorded. For safety assessment, adverse events were monitored. The standard IVIG dosage was approximately 0.35 g/kg body weight every 3-4 weeks. Most patients had normal IgG trough values of >600 mg/dL during the IVIG treatment period. The rate of bacterial infections was reduced from 2.4 per patient in the 3 months before IVIG to 0.7 (0-1.5) per patient per year during IVIG treatment. All patients received concomitant medication, mainly anticancer and anti-anemia therapy (100%). No serious adverse events related to IVIG were observed.

However, evidence supporting their mechanism of action is scanty. This work provides first results from a preclinical swine model of excisional wounds, elucidating the mechanism of action of a modified collagen gel (MCG) dressing. Following wounding, wound-edge tissue was collected at specific time intervals (3, 7, 14, and 21 days postwounding). On day 7, histological analysis showed significant increase in the length of rete ridges, suggesting improved biomechanical properties of the healing wound tissue. Rapid and transient mounting of inflammation is necessary for efficient healing. MCG significantly accelerated neutrophil and macrophage recruitment to the wound site on day 3 and day 7 with successful resolution of inflammation on day 21. MCG induced monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression in neutrophil-like human promyelocytic leukemia-60 cells in vitro. In vivo, MCG-treated wound tissue displayed elevated vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Consistently, MCG-treated wounds displayed significantly higher abundance of endothelial cells with increased blood flow to the wound area indicating improved vascularization. This observation was explained by the finding that MCG enhanced proliferation of wound-site endothelial cells. In MCG-treated wound tissue, Masson's trichrome and picrosirius red staining showed higher abundance of collagen and increased collagen type I:III ratio. This work presents first evidence from a preclinical setting explaining how a collagen-based dressing may improve wound closure by targeting multiple key mechanisms. The current findings warrant additional studies to determine whether the responses to the MCG are different from other collagen-based products used in clinical setting.","['Elgharably, Haytham', 'Roy, Sashwati', 'Khanna, Savita', 'Abas, Motaz', 'Dasghatak, Piya', 'Das, Amitava', 'Mohammed, Kareem', 'Sen, Chandan K']","['Elgharably H', 'Roy S', 'Khanna S', 'Abas M', 'Dasghatak P', 'Das A', 'Mohammed K', 'Sen CK']","['Department of Surgery, Davis Heart & Lung Research Institute, Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cell-B Therapies and Comprehensive Wound Center, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130422,United States,Wound Repair Regen,Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,9310939,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Collagen/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gels', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'RNA/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/blood supply/*injuries/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Wound Healing/*physiology', 'Wounds and Injuries/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",PMC3685858,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/12/20 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/wrr.12039 [doi]'],ppublish,Wound Repair Regen. 2013 May-Jun;21(3):473-81. doi: 10.1111/wrr.12039.

Despite the success of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in the therapy of CML, TKI-resistance remains an unsolved problem in the clinic. We have recently shown that Gab2 signalling counteracts the efficacy of four distinct Bcr-Abl inhibitors. In the course of that project, we noticed that two clinically relevant drugs, imatinib and dasatinib, provoke distinct alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of Gab2, its signalling output and protein interactions. As the signalling potential of the docking protein is highly modulated by its phosphorylation status, we set out to obtain more insights into the impact of TKIs on Gab2 phosphorylation. FINDINGS: Using stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), we show now that imatinib and dasatinib provoke distinct effects on the phosphorylation status and interactome of Gab2. This study identifies several new phosphorylation sites on Gab2 and confirms many sites previously known from other experimental systems. At equimolar concentrations, dasatinib is more effective in preventing Gab2 tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation than imatinib. It also affects the phosphorylation status of more residues than imatinib. In addition, we also identify novel components of the Gab2 signalling complex, such as casein kinases, stathmins and PIP1 as well as known interaction partners whose association with Gab2 is disrupted by imatinib and/or dasatinib. CONCLUSIONS: By using MS-based proteomics, we have identified new and confirmed known phosphorylation sites and interaction partners of Gab2, which may play an important role in the regulation of this docking protein. Given the growing importance of Gab2 in several tumour entities we expect that our results will help to understand the complex regulation of Gab2 and how this docking protein can contribute to malignancy.","['Halbach, Sebastian', 'Rigbolt, Kristoffer Tg', 'Wohrle, Franziska U', 'Diedrich, Britta', 'Gretzmeier, Christine', 'Brummer, Tilman', 'Dengjel, Jorn']","['Halbach S', 'Rigbolt KT', 'Wohrle FU', 'Diedrich B', 'Gretzmeier C', 'Brummer T', 'Dengjel J']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research (IMMZ), Faculty of Medicine, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Stefan-Meier-Str, 17, Freiburg 79104, Germany. tilman.brummer@zbsa.uni-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130422,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,,,PMC3640961,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/04/24 06:01,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['1478-811X-11-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1478-811X-11-30 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2013 Apr 22;11(1):30. doi: 10.1186/1478-811X-11-30.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic effects of CdA have been suggested to be mediated partly through its potent toxicity towards lymphocytes. However, the effects of CdA on other immune cells are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of CdA on the induction of apoptosis in human monocytes, monocyte-derived immature (ImDC) and mature (mDC) dendritic cells. Treatment of monocytes with CdA strongly induced apoptosis after 24 h, while apoptosis induction in DC was evident after 72 h. Furthermore, CdA treatment strongly induced caspase-3 and caspase-9 in monocytes, whereas activation of caspases was undetected in DC. The mitochondrial membrane potential in DC was reduced significantly after CdA treatment. DNA hypodiploid assessment showed fragmented nuclei in DC after CdA treatment together with activation of p53 protein. These results revealed that CdA induces caspase-independent apoptosis in DC and suggest cell type specific effects of CdA. This mechanism may contribute to the effect of CdA in autoimmune diseases.","['Singh, V', 'Prajeeth, C K', 'Gudi, V', 'Benardais, K', 'Voss, E V', 'Stangel, M']","['Singh V', 'Prajeeth CK', 'Gudi V', 'Benardais K', 'Voss EV', 'Stangel M']","['Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neurochemistry, Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3722929,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cei.12109 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2013 Aug;173(2):288-97. doi: 10.1111/cei.12109.,2,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,,,,,['(c) 2013 British Society for Immunology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['DNA fragmentation', 'caspases', 'cladribine', 'mitochondrial potential', 'phosphatidylserine']",,,,,,,

These functions mostly depend on a Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly (GLFG) sequence appearing repetitively in the N-terminal region of Nup98. As the GLFG sequence is well conserved among Nup98s from a wide variety of species including humans, yeasts, and ciliates such as Tetrahymena thermophila, a specific antibody that recognizes the GLFG sequence is expected to detect various Nup98s from a wide-range of species. To generate monoclonal antibodies specific to the GLFG repeat of Nup98, we used two synthetic polypeptides derived from the macronuclear Nup98 of T. thermophila as an antigen. We obtained two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 13C2 and 21A10, that recognize Nup98s in indirect immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis of T. thermophila. Peptide array analysis of these monoclonal antibodies located the position of their epitopes at or near GLFG residues: the epitope recognized by the 13C2 MAb is FGxxN (x being any amino acid), and the epitope recognized by the 21A10 MAb is GLF. As expected by their epitopes, these monoclonal antibodies also recognize Nup98 homologs expressed by human cells and the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that 13C2 and 21A10 MAbs recognize Nup98 epitopes common to phylogenetically distinct organisms. Thus, these MAbs are useful in studying a wide variety of biological phenomena that involve Nup98, ranging from ciliate nuclear dimorphism to NUP98-related human leukemia.","['Iwamoto, Masaaki', 'Asakawa, Haruhiko', 'Ohtsuki, Chizuru', 'Osakada, Hiroko', 'Koujin, Takako', 'Hiraoka, Yasushi', 'Haraguchi, Tokuko']","['Iwamoto M', 'Asakawa H', 'Ohtsuki C', 'Osakada H', 'Koujin T', 'Hiraoka Y', 'Haraguchi T']","['Advanced ICT Research Institute Kobe, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother,Monoclonal antibodies in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy,101590955,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*chemistry', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Protozoan Proteins/*immunology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid/immunology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*immunology', 'Schizosaccharomyces', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/*immunology', 'Tetrahymena thermophila']",PMC3732132,2013/04/24 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/mab.2012.0118 [doi]'],ppublish,Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother. 2013 Apr;32(2):81-90. doi: 10.1089/mab.2012.0118.,2,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Protozoan Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alemtuzumab, an antibody targeting the lymphocyte-specific surface marker CD52, is an approved agent for the treatment of CLL. Despite its demonstrated efficacy, likely secondary to concerns regarding infectious complications, it is most commonly used in the relapsed and refractory setting. Given alemtuzumab's unique mechanism of action it has been demonstrated to have activity in disease that is refractory to both alkylating agents and purine analogs. Furthermore, it has activity in TP53-mutated disease, which has the worst prognosis of any subset of CLL. Alemtuzumab has greater efficacy on circulating disease relative to nodal disease. Rational combinations are attempting to use these attributes to increase response rates in patients with relapsed and refractory disease.","['Warner, Jeremy L', 'Arnason, Jon E']","['Warner JL', 'Arnason JE']","['Hematologic Malignancy and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3627326,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/04/23 06:01,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620712458949 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620712458949 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2012 Dec;3(6):375-89. doi: 10.1177/2040620712458949.,6,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell', 'CD52 antigen', 'agammaglobulinaemia tyrosine kinase', 'alemtuzumab', 'chronic', 'leukemia', 'lymphocytic', 'phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase', 'recurrence']",,,,,,,

For decades, the mainstay of treatment for MDS was supportive care, including transfusion of blood products and growth factors. Further understanding of disease biology led to the discovery of a high prevalence of hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in high-risk MDS and secondary leukemias. Hence, the role of irreversible DNA methlytransferase inhibitors such as azacitidine was investigated with promising outcomes in the treatment of MDS. Azacitidine was initially approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for the treatment of all subtypes of MDS and was granted expanded approval in 2009 to reflect new overall survival data demonstrated in the AZA-001 study of patients with higher-risk MDS. Azacitidine has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful prolongation of survival in higher-risk patients with MDS and has changed the natural history of these disorders. The agent maintains a relatively safe toxicity profile, even in older patients. The role of azacitidine has been explored in the treatment of AML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and has also been studied in the peritransplant setting. Azacitidine has been combined with other novel agents such as lenalidomide, histone deacetylase inhibitors and growth factors in the hope of achieving improved outcomes. Currently, both intravenous and subcutaneous forms of azacitidine are approved for use in the USA with the oral form being granted fast track status by the FDA.","['Khan, Cyrus', 'Pathe, Neeta', 'Fazal, Salman', 'Lister, John', 'Rossetti, James M']","['Khan C', 'Pathe N', 'Fazal S', 'Lister J', 'Rossetti JM']","['Western Pennsylvania Cancer Institute, The Western Pennsylvania Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3627328,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/04/23 06:01,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620712464882 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620712464882 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2012 Dec;3(6):355-73. doi: 10.1177/2040620712464882.,6,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'methylation', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,,,,,

Large-area and highly sensitive gold nanoslits with a period of 500 nm are fabricated on polycarbonate films using the thermal-annealed template-stripping method. The coupling between gap plasmon resonance in the slits and surface plasmon polariton Bloch waves forms a sharp Fano resonance with intensity sensitivity greater than 11 000% per refractive index unit. The nanoslit array is integrated with a cell-trapping microfluidic device to monitor dynamic secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) from human acute monocytic leukemia cells in situ. Upon continuous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, MMP-9 secretion is detected within 2 h due to ultrahigh surface sensitivity and close proximity of the sensor to the target cells. In addition to the advantage of detecting early cell responses, the sensor also allows interrogation of cell secretion dynamics. Furthermore, the average secretion per cell measured using our system well matches previous reports while it requires orders of magnitude less cells. The optofluidic platform may find applications in fundamental studies of cell functions and diagnostics based on secretion signals.","['Wu, Shu-Han', 'Lee, Kuang-Li', 'Chiou, Arthur', 'Cheng, Xuanhong', 'Wei, Pei-Kuen']","['Wu SH', 'Lee KL', 'Chiou A', 'Cheng X', 'Wei PK']","['Institute of Biophotonics, National Yang-Ming University, No.155, Sec. 2, Linong Street, Taipei, Taiwan 11221 (ROC), Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,Germany,Small,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",101235338,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells/*metabolism', '*Computer Systems', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Microfluidics/*methods', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Optics and Photonics/*methods', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Temperature']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/06/12 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/smll.201203125 [doi]'],ppublish,Small. 2013 Oct 25;9(20):3532-40. doi: 10.1002/smll.201203125.

CASE SUMMARY: A 17-year-old female with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia received 177 mg of intrathecal cytarabine rather than the appropriate dose of 70 mg. She was monitored closely with no apparent toxicity from the event. A 4-year-old boy with newly diagnosed precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia received 175 mg of intrathecal cytarabine rather than the appropriate dose of 70 mg. CSF was immediately withdrawn and intrathecal hydrocortisone was instilled for possible antiinflammatory effect. He developed no apparent toxicity from the event. DISCUSSION: Cytarabine is an important chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia. One case report of intrathecal cytarabine overdose was identified in the literature, which recommended CSF exchange as management. Neither child in our report underwent CSF exchange or developed apparent toxicity related to the event. Institutional changes were made in both cases to prevent similar events. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate that measures such as CSF exchange are not uniformly required for cytarabine overdose.","['Thienprayoon, Rachel', 'Heym, Kenneth M', 'Pelfrey, Lindsay', 'Bowers, Daniel C']","['Thienprayoon R', 'Heym KM', 'Pelfrey L', 'Bowers DC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas at Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA. rachel.thienprayoon@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130419,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid', '*Drug Overdose', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Errors', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1S028 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1S028 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2013 May;47(5):e24. doi: 10.1345/aph.1S028.

Chemotherapy may have direct toxic effects on vascular endothelium, potentially increasing the significance of endothelial dysfunction in the development of CVD in ALL survivors. Endothelial structure and function can be measured with carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and brachial flow mediated dilation (FMD). IMT and FMD are intermediate markers of CVD. We studied endothelial function and the effects of an exercise program on vascular endothelium in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: Twenty-one 16-30 year old long-term survivors of ALL (age at diagnosis </=16 years) and 21 healthy controls were studied at baseline, and 17 of the ALL survivors participated in a 16 week home-based exercise program. IMT and FMD were studied before and after the exercise program. RESULTS: At baseline, the ALL survivors had impaired overall FMD response (FMDauc, P = 0.02). FMDmax(%) was 22% lower (P = 0.06) and FMD at 40 seconds 44% lower (P = 0.01) compared to healthy controls. After the exercise program, FMD at 40 seconds (P < 0.01) and IMT (P = 0.02) improved. The mean overall FMD response increased by 25% after the exercise program, but this change was not statistically significant (P = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the excess burden of CVD morbidity in this population may possibly be alleviated by simple means. The importance of physical activity on the health of childhood ALL survivors should be emphasized. Longer, controlled studies are needed to confirm our findings.","['Jarvela, Liisa S', 'Niinikoski, Harri', 'Heinonen, Olli J', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Arola, Mikko', 'Kemppainen, Jukka']","['Jarvela LS', 'Niinikoski H', 'Heinonen OJ', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Arola M', 'Kemppainen J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. liisa.jarvela@utu.fi']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130420,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/pathology/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Carotid Arteries/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Survivors', 'Tunica Intima/pathology/*physiopathology']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24565 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Sep;60(9):1546-51. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24565.

One mechanism of action is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The liver is an important target for toxicity caused by foreign compounds including mycotoxins. On the other hand, little is known about the influence of the redox state on hepatocytes treated with DON. The present study investigated the effect of DON on the cytosolic redox state and antioxidative system in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. The cell viability of human monocyte cell line THP-1 or leukemia cell line KU812 treated with 2.5 and 5 mumol/l DON were significantly reduced. However, HepG2 cells showed no toxic effects under the same conditions and did not exhibit an increased oxidative state. Further experiments showed that thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) protein levels but not glutathione increased in the cells treated with 10 mumol/l DON. In addition, the enhancement of Trx-1 content was repressed by antioxidants. These results suggest that DON-induced accumulation of Trx-1 in HepG2 cells plays one of the key roles in protection against cytotoxicity caused by DON and that the mechanism may be mediated by the antioxidant properties of Trx-1.","['Sugiyama, Kei-Ichi', 'Kinoshita, Mawo', 'Kamata, Yoichi', 'Minai, Yuji', 'Tani, Fumito', 'Sugita-Konishi, Yoshiko']","['Sugiyama K', 'Kinoshita M', 'Kamata Y', 'Minai Y', 'Tani F', 'Sugita-Konishi Y']","['Division of Microbiology, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 158-8501, Japan. sugiyama@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120316,Germany,Mycotoxin Res,Mycotoxin research,8807334,IM,"['Antioxidants/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Hep G2 Cells/drug effects', 'Hepatocytes/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects', 'Mycotoxins/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Trichothecenes/metabolism/pharmacology/*toxicity']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12550-012-0128-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycotoxin Res. 2012 Aug;28(3):163-8. doi: 10.1007/s12550-012-0128-9.

METHODS: Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either open-label barasertib 1200 mg (as a 7-day intravenous infusion) or LDAC 20 mg (subcutaneously twice daily for 10 days) in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was the objective complete response rate (OCRR) (complete responses [CR] plus confirmed CRs with incomplete recovery of neutrophils or platelets [CRi] according to Cheson criteria [also requiring reconfirmation of CRi >/=21 days after the first appearance and associated with partial recovery of platelets and neutrophils]). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. RESULTS: In total, 74 patients (barasertib, n = 48; LDAC, n = 26) completed >/=1 cycle of treatment. A significant improvement in the OCRR was observed with barasertib (35.4% vs 11.5%; difference, 23.9%; 95% confidence interval, 2.7%-39.9%; P < .05). Although the study was not formally sized to compare OS data, the median OS with barasertib was 8.2 months versus 4.5 months with LDAC (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-1.58; P = .663). Stomatitis and febrile neutropenia were the most common adverse events with barasertib versus LDAC (71% vs 15% and 67% vs 19%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Barasertib produced a significant improvement in the OCRR versus LDAC and had a more toxic but manageable safety profile, consistent with previous studies.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Ando, Kiyoshi', 'Bay, Jacques-Olivier', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Gropper, Stefanie', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Owen, Kate', 'Pike, Laura', 'Schmitt, Nicola', 'Stockman, Paul K', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Martinelli G', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Ando K', 'Bay JO', 'Wei A', 'Gropper S', 'Papayannidis C', 'Owen K', 'Pike L', 'Schmitt N', 'Stockman PK', 'Giagounidis A']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. hkantarjian@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130419,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Organophosphates/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4132839,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28113 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Jul 15;119(14):2611-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28113.

It has been recently described that AICAR triggers apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and its mechanism of action is independent of AMPK as well as p53. AICAR-mediated upregulation of the BH3-only proteins BIM and NOXA correlates with apoptosis induction in CLL cells. Here we propose mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a useful model to analyze the mechanism of AICAR-induced apoptosis. ZMP formation was required for AICAR-induced apoptosis, though direct Ampk activation with A-769662 failed to induce apoptosis in MEFs. AICAR potently induced apoptosis in Ampkalpha1 (-/-) /alpha2 (-/-) MEFs, demonstrating an Ampk-independent mechanism of cell death activation. In addition, AICAR acts independently of p53, as MEFs lacking p53 also underwent apoptosis normally. Notably, MEFs lacking Bax and Bak were completely resistant to AICAR-induced apoptosis, confirming the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in its mechanism of action. Apoptosis was preceded by ZMP-dependent but Ampk-independent modulation of the mRNA levels of different Bcl-2 family members, including Noxa, Bim and Bcl-2. Bim protein levels were accumulated upon AICAR treatment of MEFs, suggesting its role in the apoptotic process. Strikingly, MEFs lacking both Bim and Noxa displayed high resistance to AICAR. These findings support the notion that MEFs are a useful system to further dissect the mechanism of AICAR-induced apoptosis.","['Gonzalez-Girones, Diana M', 'Moncunill-Massaguer, Cristina', 'Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'Perez-Perarnau, Alba', 'Palmeri, Claudia M', 'Rubio-Patino, Camila', 'Villunger, Andreas', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Gil, Joan']","['Gonzalez-Girones DM', 'Moncunill-Massaguer C', 'Iglesias-Serret D', 'Cosialls AM', 'Perez-Perarnau A', 'Palmeri CM', 'Rubio-Patino C', 'Villunger A', 'Pons G', 'Gil J']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge IDIBELL-Universitat de Barcelona, Campus de Bellvitge, Pavello de Govern, 4 feminine planta, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08907 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0850-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Aug;18(8):1008-16. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0850-6.,8,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some treatments for ALL affect testicular function and we hypothesized that this may influence the QOL and psychosocial coping of male survivors. Our aims were to assess the QOL and psychosocial coping of male long-term ALL survivors and to evaluate the effect of both testosterone level and the potential gonadotoxicity of various treatment modalities on them. METHODS: Fifty-two male long-term survivors treated for childhood ALL at Helsinki University Hospital between 1970 and 1995, and 56 age- and gender-matched controls were studied. The participants completed a self-report questionnaire including questions on sociodemographics, RAND-36 to assess QOL, General Health Questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory to assess mental well-being, and CAGE to assess alcohol abuse/dependence. Testosterone levels were measured, and treatment details were reviewed. RESULTS: ALL survivors in general had QOL close to that of controls or population norms. Decreased QOL was seen in physical health-related subscales, and vitality and emotional well-being were lowered in survivors with more gonadotoxic treatment modalities. No single independent factor in the treatment or the level of testosterone could, however, be found to clearly explain the variation in QOL scores of the survivors. Mental well-being of most of the survivors was good, but a subgroup with previous cyclophosphamide treatment or testicular irradiation showed increased risk of psychiatric morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The male ALL survivors generally cope well, but increased focus on specific risk groups seems to be necessary. Further studies using patient interviews would probably point out issues concerning the QOL and psychosocial coping of ALL survivors, which may not emerge in these screening studies. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: In general, more attention should be paid for physical functioning of childhood ALL survivors. Increased focus should also be on QOL and mental well-being of survivors with more gonadotoxic treatment modalities and those whose diagnosis was made in their adolescence.","['Gunn, Mirja Erika', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi Maria', 'Puukko-Viertomies, Leena-Riitta', 'Henriksson, Markus', 'Heikkinen, Risto', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi']","['Gunn ME', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Puukko-Viertomies LR', 'Henriksson M', 'Heikkinen R', 'Jahnukainen K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130419,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Protocols', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/mortality/*psychology/therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Self Report', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Testicular Diseases/*etiology/*psychology', 'Testis/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-013-0285-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2013 Sep;7(3):404-12. doi: 10.1007/s11764-013-0285-7.

The objective of this study was to identify information and service needs important to YA cancer patients. METHODS: A supportive care needs survey was administered to ambulatory patients (<age 35 years) who were within 5 years of completing therapy at an adult hospital. Participants were asked to rate the importance of 18 sources of information or resources on a scale from 1 to 10. The relationship between gender, type of cancer, current treatment status, and marital status on the importance of these factors was explored using ANOVA. RESULTS: Median age of 243 respondents was 28 years (range 17-35); 61% male. The most common diagnoses were: lymphoma (28%), leukemia (19%), testis (16%), CNS (9.5%), and sarcoma (8.6%). Forty percent were currently receiving treatment; the majority were single/never married (67%). Thirty-eight percent of respondents felt it was important or very important to receive care in a dedicated unit with other young people. More than 80% rated the following items at least 8/10 in importance: information on their specific malignancy (treatment, risk of recurrence), effects of treatment on fertility, information on maintaining a healthy diet, and exercise/physical fitness during cancer treatment. Women were more likely to consider information/service needs more important than men. CONCLUSIONS: YA's have clear supportive care preferences and needs.

PSK is a biological response modifier (BRM), and its mechanism of action is partly mediated by modulating host immune systems; however, recent studies showed antiproliferative activity of PSK. Therefore, we examined the mechanism underlying the antiproliferative activity of PSK using seven different human malignant cell lines (WiDr, HT29, SW480, KATOIII, AGS, HL-60 and U937), and PSK was found to inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells most profoundly. Therefore, HL-60 cells were used to elucidate the mechanism of the antiproliferative activity. Western blotting was performed to detect phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). A p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, was used to examine the roles in PSK-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition. Flow cytometry was performed for mitochondrial membrane potential detection. PSK activated caspase-3 and induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Co-treatment with SB203580 blocked PSK-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 activation and growth inhibition. PSK induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. The depolarization of mitochondria induced by PSK was reversed by co-treatment with SB203580. The present study revealed that PSK induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells via a mitochondrial and p38 MAPK-dependent pathway.","['Hirahara, Noriyuki', 'Edamatsu, Takeo', 'Fujieda, Ayako', 'Fujioka, Masaki', 'Wada, Tsutomu', 'Tajima, Yoshitsugu']","['Hirahara N', 'Edamatsu T', 'Fujieda A', 'Fujioka M', 'Wada T', 'Tajima Y']","['Department of Digestive and General Surgery, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane 693-8501, Japan. norinorihirahara@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130422,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/01/18 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2412 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Jul;30(1):99-104. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2412.

In order to clarify mutational frequency, specificity and phenotypic associations, we sequenced CSF3R exons 14-17 in 54 clinically suspected cases of CNL (n=35) or atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n=19). Central review of these cases confirmed WHO-defined CNL in 12 patients, monoclonal gammopathy (MG)-associated CNL in 5 and WHO-defined aCML in 9. A total of 14 CSF3R mutations were detected in 13 patients, including 10 with CSF3RT618I (exon 14 mutation, sometimes annotated as CSF3R T595I). CSF3RT618I occurred exclusively in WHO-defined CNL with a mutational frequency of 83% (10 of 12 cases). CSF3R mutations were not seen in aCML or MG-associated CNL. CSF3RT618I was also absent among 170 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF; n=76) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n=94). SETBP1 mutational frequencies in WHO-defined CNL, aCML, CMML and PMF were 33, 0, 7 and 3%, respectively. Four CSF3RT618I-mutated cases co-expressed SETBP1 mutations. We conclude that CSF3RT618I is a highly sensitive and specific molecular marker for CNL and should be incorporated into current diagnostic criteria.","['Pardanani, A', 'Lasho, T L', 'Laborde, R R', 'Elliott, M', 'Hanson, C A', 'Knudson, R A', 'Ketterling, R P', 'Maxson, J E', 'Tyner, J W', 'Tefferi, A']","['Pardanani A', 'Lasho TL', 'Laborde RR', 'Elliott M', 'Hanson CA', 'Knudson RA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Maxson JE', 'Tyner JW', 'Tefferi A']","['Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130422,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Bone Marrow', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Mutation Rate', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC4100617,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013122 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.122 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Sep;27(9):1870-3. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.122.

Herein, a comprehensive MFC analysis on bone marrow samples from 244 newly diagnosed patients with an immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal protein was performed, including 67 IgM-MGUS, 77 smoldering and 100 symptomatic WM. Our results show a progressive increase on the number and light-chain-isotype-positive B-cells from IgM-MGUS to smoldering and symptomatic WM (P<.001), with only 1% of IgM-MGUS patients showing >10% B cells or 100% light-chain-isotype-positive B-cells (P<.001). Complete light-chain restriction of the B-cell compartment was an independent prognostic factor for time-to progression in smoldering WM (median 26 months; HR: 19.8, P=0.001) and overall survival in symptomatic WM (median 44 months; HR: 2.6, P=0.004). The progressive accumulation of light-chain-isotype-positive B-cells accompanied the emergence of a characteristic Waldenstrom's phenotype (CD22(+dim) / CD25+ /CD27+ / IgM+) that differed from other B-NHL by negative expression of CD5, CD10, CD11c or CD103. In contrast to myeloma, light-chain-isotype-positive plasma cells in IgM monoclonal gammopathies show otherwise normal antigenic expression. Our results highlight the potential value of MFC immunophenotyping for the characterization of the Waldenstrom's clone, as well as for the differential diagnosis, risk of progression and survival in WM.","['Paiva, B', 'Montes, M C', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Ocio, E M', 'Alonso, J', 'de Las Heras, N', 'Escalante, F', 'Cuello, R', 'de Coca, A G', 'Galende, J', 'Hernandez, J', 'Sierra, M', 'Martin, A', 'Pardal, E', 'Barez, A', 'Alonso, J', 'Suarez, L', 'Gonzalez-Lopez, T J', 'Perez, J J', 'Orfao, A', 'Vidriales, M-B', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Paiva B', 'Montes MC', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Ocio EM', 'Alonso J', 'de Las Heras N', 'Escalante F', 'Cuello R', 'de Coca AG', 'Galende J', 'Hernandez J', 'Sierra M', 'Martin A', 'Pardal E', 'Barez A', 'Alonso J', 'Suarez L', 'Gonzalez-Lopez TJ', 'Perez JJ', 'Orfao A', 'Vidriales MB', 'San Miguel JF']","['1] Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain [2] IBSAL IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain.', '1] Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain [2] IBSAL IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', '1] Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain [2] IBSAL IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Complejo Hospitalario de Leon, Leon, Spain.', 'Complejo Hospitalario de Leon, Leon, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Hospital Comarcal del Bierzo, PonferradaLeon, Spain.', 'Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia, Spain.', 'Hospital Virgen de la Concha, Zamora, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Virgen del Puerto, Plasencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Nuestra Senora de Sonsoles, Avila, Spain.', 'Hospital Rio Carrion, Palencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Santos Reyes, Aranda de Duero, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Burgos, Burgos, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain.', '1] IBSAL IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain [2] Servicio General de Citometria and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', '1] Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain [2] IBSAL IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', '1] Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Department of Hematology, Salamanca, Spain [2] IBSAL IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130422,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*blood', 'Risk Assessment', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*blood']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013124 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.124 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jan;28(1):166-73. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.124.

Previously, we reported that the Fas death receptor, while overexpressed in low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), becomes undetectable on CD34(+) progenitors when the disease progresses to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study determined the interplay between NF-kappaB and Fas during MDS progression. We first observed that Fas was induced by TNF-alpha in the HL60 cell line. In these cells, p65 (RELA) was associated with the FAS promoter, and inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway by an IKKalpha inhibitor (BAY11-7082) or lentiviral expression of a nondegradable mutant of IkappaBalpha (IkappaSR) blocked Fas expression. In contrast, TNF-alpha failed to induce Fas expression in the colon carcinoma cell line SW480, due to hypermethylation of the FAS promoter. Azacitidine rescued p65 binding on FAS promoter in vitro, and subsequently Fas expression in SW480 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway decreased the expression of Fas in MDS CD45(lo)CD34(+) bone marrow cells. However, despite the nuclear expression of p65, Fas was often low on CD45(lo)CD34(+) AML cells. TNF-alpha failed to stimulate its expression, while azacitidine efficiently rescued p65 binding and Fas reexpression. Overall, these data suggest that DNA methylation at NF-kappaB sites is responsible for FAS gene silencing.","['Ettou, Sandrine', 'Humbrecht, Catherine', 'Benet, Blandine', 'Billot, Katy', ""d'Allard, Diane"", 'Mariot, Virginie', 'Goodhardt, Michele', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Solary, Eric', 'Fontenay, Michaela']","['Ettou S', 'Humbrecht C', 'Benet B', 'Billot K', ""d'Allard D"", 'Mariot V', 'Goodhardt M', 'Kosmider O', 'Mayeux P', 'Solary E', 'Fontenay M']","[""Departement d'Immunologie-Hematologie, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130419,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', '*Disease Progression', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/genetics', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/04/22 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-12-0607 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0607 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2013 Jul;11(7):724-35. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0607.

In this study, miR-150 acts as a potent leukemic tumor suppressor by blocking the oncogenic properties of leukemic cells. By using MLL-AF9-transformed cells, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of miR-150 inhibits blast colony formation, cell growth, and increases apoptosis in vitro. More importantly, ectopic expression of miR-150 in MLL-AF9-transformed cells completely blocked the development of myeloid leukemia in transplanted mice. Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed that miR-150 altered the expression levels of more than 30 ""stem cell signature"" genes and many others that are involved in critical cancer pathways. In addition to the known miR-150 target Myb, we also identified Cbl and Egr2 as bona fide targets and shRNA-mediated suppression of these genes recapitulated the pro-apoptotic effects observed in leukemic cells with miR-150 ectopic expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that miR-150 is a potent leukemic tumor suppressor that regulates multiple oncogenes. IMPLICATIONS: These data establish new, key players for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat MLL-AF9-related leukemia.","['Bousquet, Marina', 'Zhuang, Guoqing', 'Meng, Cong', 'Ying, Wei', 'Cheruku, Patali S', 'Shie, Andrew T', 'Wang, Stephanie', 'Ge, Guangtao', 'Wong, Piu', 'Wang, Gang', 'Safe, Stephen', 'Zhou, Beiyan']","['Bousquet M', 'Zhuang G', 'Meng C', 'Ying W', 'Cheruku PS', 'Shie AT', 'Wang S', 'Ge G', 'Wong P', 'Wang G', 'Safe S', 'Zhou B']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130419,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/04/16 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-13-0002-T [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0002-T [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2013 Aug;11(8):912-22. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0002-T.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients before/after immunotherapy (stem cell transplantation or donor lymphocyte infusion), their suppressive role can contribute to suppress severe graft-versus-host reactions, but also to impair antileukemic reactions. As leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DCleu) are known to improve the antileukemic functionality of T cells, we evaluated the composition and development of distinct Treg subtypes in AML patients (n=12) compared with healthy probands (n=5) under unstimulated conditions and during stimulation with DCleu-containing DC (DC) or blast-containing mononuclear cells (MNC) in 0- to 7-day mixed lymphocyte cultures by flow cytometry. T-cell subgroups in AML patients were correlated with antileukemic functionality before and after DC or MNC stimulation by functional fluorolysis assays. (1) AML patients' T cells presented with significantly higher frequencies of Treg subgroups in unstimulated T cells compared with healthy probands. (2) After 7 days of DC or MNC stimulation, all Treg subtypes generally increased; significantly higher frequencies of Treg subtypes were still found in AML patients. (3) Antileukemic cytotoxicity was achieved in 36% of T cells after MNC compared with 64% after DC stimulation. Antileukemic activity after DC but not after MNC stimulation correlated with significantly lower frequencies of Treg subtypes (CD8Treg/Teff/em reg). Furthermore, cut-off values for Treg subpopulations could be defined, allowing a prediction of antileukemic response. We demonstrate a crucial role of special Treg subtypes in the mediation of antileukemic functionality. High CD8 Treg, Teff/em reg, and CD39 T cells correlated clearly with a reduced antileukemic activity of T cells. DC stimulation of T cells contributes to overcome impaired antileukemic T-cell reactivity.

Enhancing apoptotic responses by inhibiting BCL-X(L) will most likely have widespread utility in cancer treatment and, instead of inhibiting multiple prosurvival BCL-2 family members, a BCL-X(L)-selective inhibitor would be expected to minimize the toxicity to normal tissues. We describe the use of a high-throughput screen to discover a new series of small molecules targeting BCL-X(L) and their structure-guided development by medicinal chemistry. The optimized compound, WEHI-539 (7), has high affinity (subnanomolar) and selectivity for BCL-X(L) and potently kills cells by selectively antagonizing its prosurvival activity. WEHI-539 will be an invaluable tool for distinguishing the roles of BCL-X(L) from those of its prosurvival relatives, both in normal cells and notably in malignant tumor cells, many of which may prove to rely upon BCL-X(L) for their sustained growth.","['Lessene, Guillaume', 'Czabotar, Peter E', 'Sleebs, Brad E', 'Zobel, Kerry', 'Lowes, Kym N', 'Adams, Jerry M', 'Baell, Jonathan B', 'Colman, Peter M', 'Deshayes, Kurt', 'Fairbrother, Wayne J', 'Flygare, John A', 'Gibbons, Paul', 'Kersten, Wilhelmus J A', 'Kulasegaram, Sanji', 'Moss, Rebecca M', 'Parisot, John P', 'Smith, Brian J', 'Street, Ian P', 'Yang, Hong', 'Huang, David C S', 'Watson, Keith G']","['Lessene G', 'Czabotar PE', 'Sleebs BE', 'Zobel K', 'Lowes KN', 'Adams JM', 'Baell JB', 'Colman PM', 'Deshayes K', 'Fairbrother WJ', 'Flygare JA', 'Gibbons P', 'Kersten WJ', 'Kulasegaram S', 'Moss RM', 'Parisot JP', 'Smith BJ', 'Street IP', 'Yang H', 'Huang DC', 'Watson KG']","['Chemical Biology Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. glessene@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130421,United States,Nat Chem Biol,Nature chemical biology,101231976,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzothiazoles/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['nchembio.1246 [pii]', '10.1038/nchembio.1246 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Chem Biol. 2013 Jun;9(6):390-7. doi: 10.1038/nchembio.1246.

Nevertheless, the clinical response to rituximab varies, and a subpopulation of patients does not respond well to this antibody. Although several molecular events have been shown to be involved in the mechanism of action of rituximab, recent studies have demonstrated that intracellular signaling pathways and the direct effects of rituximab on cell membrane components are responsible for the antilymphoma action of this drug. In the present study, we demonstrated that rituximab activated Syk and Akt, molecules with antiapoptotic functions, in several CD20-positive lymphoma cell lines. Notably, rituximab activated Syk and Akt in all the tested primary lymphoma samples from six patients. Our results show that the cholesterol levels in lymphoma cell membranes have a crucial role in the regulation of Syk and Akt. The depletion of cholesterol from the cell membrane completely blocked rituximab-induced Syk and Akt activation. Simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, also abrogated rituximab-mediated Syk and Akt activation. Finally, we report that rituximab inhibited the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, which was observed solely in Akt-activated cells. This work demonstrates for the first time that rituximab paradoxically works to suppress apoptosis under certain conditions in a manner that is dependent on the cell membrane cholesterol level. Our observations provide novel insights and suggest that the cell membrane cholesterol level represents a new biomarker for predicting patient response to rituximab. Furthermore, the modulation of lipid rafts could provide a new strategy for enhancing the antilymphoma action of rituximab.","['Nozaki, Yumi', 'Mitsumori, Toru', 'Yamamoto, Takeo', 'Kawashima, Ichiro', 'Shobu, Yuki', 'Hamanaka, Satoshi', 'Nakajima, Kei', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Kirito, Keita']","['Nozaki Y', 'Mitsumori T', 'Yamamoto T', 'Kawashima I', 'Shobu Y', 'Hamanaka S', 'Nakajima K', 'Komatsu N', 'Kirito K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130417,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Syk Kinase']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00159-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Aug;41(8):687-696.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.04.006.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and reference lists of relevant articles to November 13, 2012. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings. Thirty studies involving 1552 donors were included. The decision to donate included themes of saving life, family loyalty, building a positive identity, religious conviction, fear of invasive procedures, and social pressure and obligation. Five themes about the donation experience were identified: mental preparedness (pervasive pain, intense disappointment over recipient death, exceeding expectations, and valuing positive recipient gains), burden of responsibility (striving to be a quality donor, unresolved guilt, and exacerbated grief), feeling neglected (medical dismissiveness and family inattention), strengthened relationships (stronger family ties, establishing blood bonds), and personal sense of achievement (satisfaction and pride, personal development, hero status, and social recognition). Although HSC donation was appreciated as an opportunity to save life, some donors felt anxious and unduly compelled to donate. HSC donors became emotionally invested and felt responsible for their recipient's outcomes and were profoundly grieved and disappointed if the transplantation was unsuccessful. To maximize donor satisfaction and mitigate the psychosocial risks for HSC donors, strategies to address the emotional challenges of anxiety, sense of coercion, guilt, and grief in donors are warranted.","['Garcia, Maria C', 'Chapman, Jeremy R', 'Shaw, Peter J', 'Gottlieb, David J', 'Ralph, Angelique', 'Craig, Jonathan C', 'Tong, Allison']","['Garcia MC', 'Chapman JR', 'Shaw PJ', 'Gottlieb DJ', 'Ralph A', 'Craig JC', 'Tong A']","['Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/*psychology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Databases, Bibliographic', 'Fear/psychology', 'Grief', 'Guilt', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Motivation', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(13)00166-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jul;19(7):1046-58. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.04.012.

The cause of the reduced efficiency was hypothesized to be related to the involvement of proteins in PEI/MLV-VLP complex formation and overall complex size. To test the hypothesis and potentially improve the efficiency of the hybrid vector, ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography were used to purify MLV-VLP and to study the effect of proteins in cell culture medium on complex formation. Based on dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy, complexes formed from the purified MLV-VLPs were smaller, but surprisingly, less efficient than complexes formed from unpurified MLV-VLPs. The addition of protein to purified MLV-VLPs showed that the initial efficiency could be restored and that the purification strategy was not inactivating the MLV-VLPs. Further, by optimizing the amount of protein added to the purified MLV-VLPs, the level of transduction by PEI/MLV-VLP improved 1.6-fold. Particle characterization showed a correlation between the size of the PEI/MLV-VLP complex and the transduction efficiency, which is likely a result of greater sedimentation and cell contact during in vitro studies.","['Vupputuri, Sravanthi', 'Karode, Shishir', 'Neely, Brian J', 'Ramsey, Joshua D']","['Vupputuri S', 'Karode S', 'Neely BJ', 'Ramsey JD']","['School of Chemical Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130416,Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Culture Media/*chemistry', 'Genetic Vectors/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Proteins/*metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Ultracentrifugation']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0166-0934(13)00133-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2013 Sep;192(1-2):1-11. doi: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.04.007.

Side population (SP) cells, exhibiting stem cell-like properties, express ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein [BCRP]). This study revealed that over-expression of ABCG2 in Jurkat and HL60 cells led to an increased SP fraction, up-regulated levels of phosphorylated-PI3K and phosphorylated-Akt, and enhanced drug resistance, all of which could be attenuated by treatment with either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. ABCG2 expression and SP cell counts were further characterized in 222 adult AL patients at three disease stages: upon diagnosis, at remission and at refractory/relapse (R/R), while 10 healthy donors served as the normal controls. Only a small fraction of the ABCG2+population (0.05-12.3%) and SP cells (0.02-1.60%) were observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. In the normal control population, the SP cell fraction represented a statistically higher percentage of total cells compared to the fraction of SP cells upon diagnosis or relapse in both AML and ALL. In addition, we demonstrated that ABCG2 expression and SP cell ratios can be upregulated by the inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein, achieved in this study by removing inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Collectively, this study suggests that the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway up-regulates ABCG2 expression and the SP cell population and is a potential AL-specific treatment target worth investigating further.","['Huang, Fang-Fang', 'Wu, Deng-Shu', 'Zhang, Li', 'Yu, Yan-Hui', 'Yuan, Xiao-Yu', 'Li, Wen-Jin', 'Chen, Xiao-Ping', 'Zhao, Xie-Lan', 'Chen, Fang-Ping', 'Zeng, Hui']","['Huang FF', 'Wu DS', 'Zhang L', 'Yu YH', 'Yuan XY', 'Li WJ', 'Chen XP', 'Zhao XL', 'Chen FP', 'Zeng H']","['Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130416,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/08/16 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(13)00326-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2013.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2013 Aug 9;336(1):96-105. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2013.04.006.

In colorectal cancer, losses of chromosome arm 8p and gains of chromosome arm 8q are among the most common chromosomal rearrangements, suggesting that the centromeric portion of chromosome 8 is particularly sensitive to breakage. Genomic alterations frequently occur in the early stages of tumorigenesis at specific genomic regions known as common fragile sites (cFSs). CFSs represent parts of the normal chromosome structure that are prone to breakage under replication stress. In this study, we identified the genomic location of FRA8I, spanning 530 kb at 8q11.21 and assessed the composition of the fragile DNA sequence. FRA8I encompasses KIAA0146, a large protein-coding gene with yet unknown function, as well as CEBPD and part of PRKDC, two genes encoding proteins involved in tumorigenesis in a variety of cancers. We show that FRA8I is unstable in lymphocytes and epithelial cells, displaying similar expression rates. We examined copy number alteration patterns within FRA8I in a panel of 25 colorectal cancer cell lines and surveyed publically available profiles of 56 additional colorectal cancer cell lines. Combining these data shows that focal recombination events disrupt the genomic integrity of KIAA0146 and neighboring cFS genes in 12.3% of colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, data analysis revealed evidence that KIAA0146 is a translocation partner of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in recurrent t(8;14)(q11;q32) translocations in a subset of patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our data molecularly describe a region of enhanced chromosomal instability in the human genome and point to a role of the KIAA0146 gene in tumorigenesis.","['Brueckner, Lena M', 'Hess, Elisa M', 'Schwab, Manfred', 'Savelyeva, Larissa']","['Brueckner LM', 'Hess EM', 'Schwab M', 'Savelyeva L']","['Division of Tumor Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130416,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Fragile Sites', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/08/16 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(13)00327-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2013.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2013 Aug 9;336(1):85-95. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2013.04.007.

However, the exact role of CAV1 in childhood leukemia is still controversial. We investigated six novel polymorphic variants of CAV1, namely C521A (rs1997623), G14713A (rs3807987), G21985A (rs12672038), T28608A (rs3757733), T29107A (rs7804372), and G32124A (rs3807992), and analyzed the association of each specific genotype with susceptibility to childhood leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 266 patients with childhood leukemia and 266 age-matched healthy controls, recruited from two major medical centers in Taiwan, were genotyped investigating the association of these polymorphisms with childhood leukemia. RESULTS: We found that there were significant differences between childhood leukemia and control groups in the distributions of their genotypes (p=4.1x10(-8) and 0.0167) and allelic frequencies (p=4.9x10(-10) and 3.7x10(-3)) in the CAV1 G14713A and T29107A polymorphisms, respectively. As for the haplotype analysis, those who had GG/AT or GG/AA at CAV1 G14713A/T29107A had a reduced risk of childhood leukemia compared to those with GG/TT, while those with any other combinations were at increased risk. CONCLUSION: The A allele of CAV1 G14713A is risky, while the A allele of CAV1 T29107A is protective for the development of childhood leukemia and these may be novel useful genomic markers for the early detection of childhood leukemia.","['Wang, Chung-Hsing', 'Lai, Yu-Liang', 'Chang, Wen-Shin', 'Wu, Kang-Hsi', 'Lane, Hsien-Yuan', 'Chiu, Chang-Fang', 'Tsai, Fuu-Jen', 'Lin, Cheng-Chieh', 'Bau, Da-Tian']","['Wang CH', 'Lai YL', 'Chang WS', 'Wu KH', 'Lane HY', 'Chiu CF', 'Tsai FJ', 'Lin CC', 'Bau DT']","['Terry Fox Cancer Research Lab, Department of Medical Genetics, China Medical University Hospital, and Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, 2 Yuh-Der Road, Taichung, 404 Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caveolin 1/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Taiwan']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10/2/75 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2013 Mar-Apr;10(2):75-9.,2,,['0 (Caveolin 1)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rap G proteins mediate diverse cellular events such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and gene activation through various signaling pathways. Activation of Rap signal is regulated tightly by several specific regulatory proteins including guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins. Beyond cell biological studies, increasing attempts have been made in the past decade to define the roles of Rap signal in specific functions of normal tissue systems as well as in cancer. In the immune and hematopoietic systems, Rap signal plays crucial roles in the development and function of essentially all lineages of lymphocytes and hematopoietic cells, and importantly, deregulated Rap signal may lead to unique pathological conditions depending on the affected cell types, including various types of leukemia and autoimmunity. The phenotypical studies have unveiled novel, even unexpected functional aspects of Rap signal in cells from a variety of tissues, providing potentially important clues for controlling human diseases, including malignancy.","['Minato, Nagahiro']",['Minato N'],"['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. : minato@imm.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130418,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphopoiesis/*genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'rap GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(13)00168-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2013 Sep 10;319(15):2323-8. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.04.009.

Critically, patterns of multiple enzymatic and nonenzymatic PTMs within a single enzyme are now functionally evaluated providing a holistic picture of a macromolecule interacting with low molecular mass compounds, some of them being substrates, enzyme regulators, or activated precursors for enzymatic and nonenzymatic PTMs. Multiple PTMs within a single enzyme molecule and their mutual interplays are critical for the regulation of catalytic activity. Full understanding of this regulation will require detailed structural investigation of enzymes, their structural analogs, and their complexes. Further, proteomics is now integrated with molecular genetics, transcriptomics, and other areas leading to systems biology strategies. These allow the functional interrogation of complex enzymatic networks in their natural environment. In the future, one might envisage the use of robust high throughput analytical techniques that will be able to detect multiple PTMs on a global scale of individual proteomes from a number of carefully selected cells and cellular compartments.

Using microarray profiling to explore the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), we identified a dramatic decrease in the expression of the hematopoietic specific miR-142-3p. Up- and down-regulation of this miRNA in primary human monocytes altered CSF1-induced differentiation of monocytes, as demonstrated by changes in the expression of the cell surface markers CD16 and CD163. One of the genes whose expression is repressed by miR-142-3p encodes the transcription factor Early Growth Response 2 (Egr2). In turn, Egr2 associated with its co-repressor NGFI-A (Nerve Growth Factor-Induced gene-A) binding protein 2 (NAB2) binds to the pre-miR-142-3p promoter to negatively regulate its expression. Interestingly, the expression of miR-142-3p is abnormally low in monocytes from patients with the most proliferative forms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and miR-142-3p re-expression in CMML dysplastic monocytes can improve their differentiation potential. Altogether, miR-142-3p which functions in a molecular circuitry with Egr2 is an actor of CSF1-induced differentiation of human monocytes whose expression could be altered in CMML.","['Lagrange, Brice', 'Martin, Romain Z', 'Droin, Nathalie', 'Aucagne, Romain', 'Paggetti, Jerome', 'Largeot, Anne', 'Itzykson, Raphael', 'Solary, Eric', 'Delva, Laurent', 'Bastie, Jean-Noel']","['Lagrange B', 'Martin RZ', 'Droin N', 'Aucagne R', 'Paggetti J', 'Largeot A', 'Itzykson R', 'Solary E', 'Delva L', 'Bastie JN']","['Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130417,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics/metabolism', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(13)00167-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Aug;1833(8):1936-46. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.04.007.

Studies with chimeras constructed from the A8 virus and the non-neuropathogenic Fr-MLV clone 57 identified a 0.3-kb KpnI-AatII fragment containing a R-U5-5'leader sequence as an important determinant for inducing spongiosis, in addition to the env gene of A8 as the primary determinant. This 0.3-kb fragment contains a 17-nucleotide difference between the A8 and 57 sequences. We previously showed that the 0.3-kb fragment influences expression levels of Env protein in both cultured cells and rat brain, but the corresponding molecular mechanisms are not well understood. RESULTS: Studies with expression vectors constructed from the full-length proviral genome of Fr-MLV that incorporated the luciferase (luc) gene instead of the env gene found that the vector containing the A8-0.3-kb fragment yielded a larger amount of spliced luc-mRNA and showed higher expression of luciferase when compared to the vector containing the 57-0.3-kb fragment. The amount of total transcripts from the vectors, the poly (A) tail length of their mRNAs, and the nuclear-cytoplasm distribution of luc-mRNA in transfected cells were also evaluated. The 0.3-kb fragment did not influence transcription efficiency, mRNA polyadenylation or nuclear export of luc-mRNA. Mutational analyses were carried out to determine the importance of nucleotides that differ between the A8 and 57 sequences within the 0.3-kb fragment. In particular, seven nucleotides upstream of the 5'splice site (5'ss) were found to be important in regulating the level of protein expression from spliced messages. Interestingly, these nucleotides reside within the stem-loop structure that has been speculated to limit the recognition of 5'ss. CONCLUSIONS: The 0.3-kb fragment containing the R-U5-5'leader sequence of Fr-MLV influences the level of protein expression from the spliced-mRNA by regulating the splicing efficiency rather than transcription, nuclear export of spliced-mRNA, or poly (A) addition to mRNA. Seven nucleotides in the 0.3-kb fragment, which reside within the stem-loop structure that has been speculated to limit recognition of the 5'ss, could pinpoint the function of this region.","['Choo, Yeng Cheng', 'Seki, Yohei', 'Machinaga, Akihito', 'Ogita, Nobuo', 'Takase-Yoden, Sayaka']","['Choo YC', 'Seki Y', 'Machinaga A', 'Ogita N', 'Takase-Yoden S']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Faculty of Engineering, Soka University, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-8577, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130419,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,IM,"[""*5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Luciferases/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*biosynthesis']",PMC3651342,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-10-124 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-10-124 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2013 Apr 19;10:124. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-124.,,,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the mechanisms underlying the high expression of Bmi1 in NPC remain obscure. To gain new insights into the transcriptional regulation of BMI1, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of BMI1. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the region from -783 to +375 showed significant promoter activity. With the use of a series of 5'-deletion and 3'-deletion promoter constructs in luciferase reporter assays, the +167/+232 and -536/-134 regions were found to be sufficient for full promoter activity. Transcriptional activity of the BMI1 promoter was dependent on the Sp1 binding site cluster (+181/+214) as well as the E-box elements (-181), and was abolished after mutation of the two cis-elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Sp1 bound to the region from +181 to +214 within the BMI1 promoter. In addition, gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses revealed that Sp1 augmented Bmi1 expression. Further investigations using immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR disclosed a significant positive correlation between the expression of Sp1 and Bmi1 in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, NPC cells, and NPC tissue specimens. In addition, Myc, the known transcription factor for BMI1 in neuroblastomas, also activated the transcription of BMI1 through binding to the E-box element (-181) within its promoter, and showed a positive correlation with the mRNA level of BMI1 in NPC. In conclusion, these findings provide valuable mechanistic insights into the role of Sp1 and c-Myc in BMI1 transcription in NPC, and suggest that targeting of Sp1 or c-Myc may be a potential therapeutic strategy for NPC.","['Wang, Hong-Bo', 'Liu, Gui-Hong', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Xing, Shan', 'Hu, Li-Juan', 'Zhao, Wei-Feng', 'Xie, Bo', 'Li, Man-Zhi', 'Zeng, Bo-Hang', 'Li, Yingqiu', 'Zeng, Mu-Sheng']","['Wang HB', 'Liu GH', 'Zhang H', 'Xing S', 'Hu LJ', 'Zhao WF', 'Xie B', 'Li MZ', 'Zeng BH', 'Li Y', 'Zeng MS']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-sesn University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130524,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/febs.12299 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2013 Jun;280(12):2929-44. doi: 10.1111/febs.12299.

Until now, clinical trials for TNBCs using EGFR inhibitors (EGFRis) as single agents have yielded disappointing results. Here, we report that combinatorial treatment using EGFRis, such as gefitinib or erlotinib, with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors (PI3K/AKTis) demonstrated a synergistic, anti-proliferative effect in cell lines of the basal-like (BL) subtype, a subtype of TNBC. Western blot analysis revealed that the gefitinib/PI-103 combination significantly reduced the level of both phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK in two susceptible BL subtype cell lines, SUM149PT and MDA-MB-468, whereas it had little or no effect on the level of phospho-ERK in two non-susceptible cell lines (HS578T and MDA-MB-231) of mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) TNBC subtype. The gefitinib/PI-103 combination also significantly induced caspase-3/7-mediated PARP cleavage and reduced two anti-apoptotic proteins, XIAP and Bcl-2 in the susceptible cell lines. In addition, the level of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) protein was markedly decreased by gefitinib/PI-103 combination in the BL TNBC cells, but showed no significant change by this combination in MSL subtype cells. These results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of EGFR used in combination of PI3K/AKTis is a potential therapeutic approach to treat a subtype of TNBCs.","['Yi, Yong Weon', 'Hong, Wooyoung', 'Kang, Hyo Jin', 'Kim, Hee Jeong', 'Zhao, Wenjing', 'Wang, Antai', 'Seong, Yeon-Sun', 'Bae, Insoo']","['Yi YW', 'Hong W', 'Kang HJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Zhao W', 'Wang A', 'Seong YS', 'Bae I']","['Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130420,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Furans/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC3822817,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcmm.12046 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2013 May;17(5):648-56. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.12046.

Recently, CPPs were introduced that showed greatly enhanced delivery efficiency. However, the molecular basis of this increased activity is poorly understood. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the molecular and physicochemical properties of seven different siRNA-CPP nanoparticles. In addition, we determined which complexes are internalized most efficiently into the leukemia cell-line SKNO-1, and subsequently inhibited the expression of a luciferase reporter gene. We demonstrated effective complexation of siRNA for all tested CPPs, and optimal encapsulation of the siRNA was achieved at very similar molar ratios independent of peptide charge. However, CPPs with an extreme high or low overall charge proved to be exceptions, suggesting an optimal range of charge for CPP-siRNA nanoparticle formation based on opposite charge. The most active CPP (PepFect6) displayed high serum resistance but also high sensitivity to decomplexation by polyanionic macromolecules, indicating the necessity for partial decomplexation for efficient uptake. Surprisingly, CPP-siRNA complexes acquired a negative zeta-potential in the presence of serum. These novel insights shed light on the observation that cell association is necessary but not sufficient for activity and motivate new research into the nature of the nanoparticle-cell interaction.

Identifying high-risk tumours is important when rationalizing clinical review for patients with cSCC. OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of death certification in cases of reported fatal cSCC and to identify risk factors for fatal cSCC. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study of cases of fatal cSCC over 11 years (1993-2004) in Leeds, identified in cancer registry and death certification data. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were recorded by the registry as having fatal cSCC in this period. Review of case notes and pathology specimens, where available (34 cases), confirmed that 21/34 patients had died of cSCC. Five were on the ear and none on the lip. Four patients had been treated for leukaemia or lymphoma and one was a renal transplant recipient. On pathology review five patients proved to have had malignant adnexal tumours rather than cSCC, and one a melanoma. In addition, three patients had disease of the ear canal or vulva. CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of deaths were falsely attributed to cSCC as a result of inaccurate histological diagnosis. Some fatalities were related to tumours in sites known to be at higher risk, and a significant proportion was postulated to be related to immunosuppression. In those cases attributed to cSCC in which this could be assessed, the majority were American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 2 and only 24% were in high-risk sites.","['Rose, R F', 'Boon, A', 'Forman, D', 'Merchant, W', 'Bishop, R', 'Newton-Bishop, J A']","['Rose RF', 'Boon A', 'Forman D', 'Merchant W', 'Bishop R', 'Newton-Bishop JA']","['Department of Dermatology, Chapel Allerton Hospital, Leeds, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*mortality/pathology', 'Death Certificates', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology']",,2013/04/23 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjd.12388 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2013 Sep;169(3):682-6. doi: 10.1111/bjd.12388.,3,,,,,['10589/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,['(c) 2013 British Association of Dermatologists.'],,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exogenous Notch2 overexpression on cell proliferation and possible mechanisms in the human CML cell line K562. When exogenous intracellular fragment of Notch2 (ICN2) was transfected into K562 cells with Lipofectamine 2000, the expression of Notch2 mRNA and protein were upregulated. Cell numbers decreased and the proliferation was inhibited significantly after transfection with ICN2. G1 phase cells increased and S phase cells decreased 48 h after transfection. Finally, the expression of Numb, Bcl-2, NF-kappaB and TGF-beta1 was detected. It was found that the expression of NF-kappaB and TGF-beta1 mRNA was increased, while Bcl-2 was downregulated, with Numb expression unchanged. Our study indicates that the Notch pathway is activated in K562 cells after ICN2 transfection. It inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells, likely by upregulating the expression of NF-kappaB and TGF-beta1 mRNA and downregulating the expression of Bcl-2.","['Yang, Zesong', 'Yang, Chunxiu', 'Zhang, Shunjun', 'Li, Ying', 'Chen, Jianbin']","['Yang Z', 'Yang C', 'Zhang S', 'Li Y', 'Chen J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130129,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,PMC3629273,2013/04/20 06:00,2013/04/20 06:01,['2013/04/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2013.1159 [doi]', 'ol-05-04-1390 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2013 Apr;5(4):1390-1394. doi: 10.3892/ol.2013.1159.

Previously, no standard treatment protocol for elderly patients with AML existed, however the development of hypomethylating agents, including decitabine, has brought about promising results in AML. In the present study, we report on the usage of a lower than routine dosage of decitabine in patients over 80 years old with AML. Since January 2010, 5 patients diagnosed with AML over the age of 80 years old received treatment with decitabine in our hospital. Decitabine was administered at a dose of 10-15 mg/m(2) and repeated every other day for a total of 5 days. This cycle was repeated for approximately 6 weeks. The 5 patients received a total of 19 cycles of treatment with decitabine. No patient achieved complete or partial remission. An antileukemic effect was observed in 25% of courses (3/12). An increase in platelet count of >20x10(9)/l was observed in 26.3% (5/19) of cycles compared with previous treatment. An increase in hemoglobin concentration of >20 g/l was observed in 36.8% (7/19) of cycles in comparison to previous treatment, four of which achieved normal hemoglobin levels. One patient became red blood cell transfusion-independent. The median survival time was 19.8+/-4.8 months. Survival time from decitabine administration to mortality was 13.2+/-5.1 months. The main side-effect was bone marrow suppression with grade III-IV thrombocytopenia, grade III-IV leukocytopenia, grade III-IV neutropenia and anemia accounting for 94.7% (18/19), 47.4% (9/19), 89.5% (17/19) and 21.1% (4/19), respectively. Severe infection or bleeding was not observed and no patient stopped treatment due to adverse effects. In conclusion, extremely low-dose decitabine may be used safely in elderly patients and achieved longer survival times than reported previously in AML patients aged 80 and above. It is suggested that complete remission may not be the primary objective, while improvement of quality of life may be a better choice in AML patients over 80 years old. The cases observed in our study were limited, so more cases are required for further study.","['Lin, Jie', 'Zhu, Hongli', 'Li, Suxia', 'Fan, Hui', 'Lu, Xuechun', 'Chang, Cheng', 'Guo, Bo', 'Zhai, Bing']","['Lin J', 'Zhu H', 'Li S', 'Fan H', 'Lu X', 'Chang C', 'Guo B', 'Zhai B']","[""Department of Geriatric Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Haidian, Beijing 100853, P.R.

In this study, the clinical and laboratory data of 210 CLL patients who were admitted to a single center in China between 2002 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. CLL patients had a median age of 60.2 years (range, 35-92 years) and CLL occurred more often in elderly female patients than in male patients (female:male, 1.2:1). The overall response rate [ORR, complete remission (CR) + partial remission (PR)] in the entire cohort of patients was 69.5% and the median overall survival (OS) was 67 months (95% CI, 57.88-76.11). In univariate analysis, an age of >60 years, chromosome 17p deletion (17p(-)) and elevated beta2-MG were associated with a worse OS. Patients with all three poor prognostic factors had a worse outcome than patients with only one or two factors. Patients with 17p(-) had a significantly lower ORR (P=0.008) and shorter OS (P=0.001) than those without 17p(-). Rituximab (R)-based treatment was able to overcome the poor prognosis associated with 17p(-). Moreover, the addition of R to fludarabine (F) and cyclophosphamide (C) treatment significantly improved the OS (P=0.012) compared with FC alone in younger patients. However, there were no significant benefits for older patients (P=0.07). This implies that the age of a patient is important in their response to therapy and survival.","['Xu, Zhenshu', 'Zhang, Jinyan', 'Wu, Shunquan', 'Zheng, Zhihong', 'Chen, Zhizhe', 'Zhan, Rong']","['Xu Z', 'Zhang J', 'Wu S', 'Zheng Z', 'Chen Z', 'Zhan R']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, P.R.

Although the presenting signs and symptoms include those seen in multiple myeloma, pPCL is characterized by several aspects that define a more aggressive course. Here, we have investigated the transcriptome of pPCLs and correlated differential expression profiles with outcome to provide insights into the biology of the disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression profiles of 21 newly diagnosed pPCLs included in a multicenter prospective clinical trial were generated using high-density microarray, then evaluated in comparison with a representative series of patients with multiple myeloma and in association with clinical outcome. RESULTS: All but one of the pPCLs had one of the main immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus translocations, whose associated transcriptional signatures resembled those observed in multiple myeloma. A 503-gene signature distinguished pPCL from multiple myeloma, from which emerged 26 genes whose expression trend was associated with progressive stages of plasma cells dyscrasia in a large dataset from multiple institutions, including samples from normal donors throughout PCL. Finally, 3 genes were identified as having expression levels that correlated with response to the first-line treatment with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, whereas a 27-gene signature was associated with overall survival independently of molecular alterations, hematologic parameters, and renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data contribute to a fine dissection of pPCL and may provide novel insights into the molecular definition of patients with poorer prognosis.","['Todoerti, Katia', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Tuana, Giacomo', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Lombardi, Luigia', 'Grieco, Vitina', 'Bianchino, Gabriella', ""D'Auria, Fiorella"", 'Statuto, Teodora', 'Mazzoccoli, Carmela', 'De Luca, Luciana', 'Petrucci, Maria Teresa', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Offidani, Massimo', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Falcone, Antonietta', ""Omede', Paola"", 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Palumbo, Antonio', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Musto, Pellegrino']","['Todoerti K', 'Agnelli L', 'Fabris S', 'Lionetti M', 'Tuana G', 'Mosca L', 'Lombardi L', 'Grieco V', 'Bianchino G', ""D'Auria F"", 'Statuto T', 'Mazzoccoli C', 'De Luca L', 'Petrucci MT', 'Morabito F', 'Offidani M', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Falcone A', ""Omede' P"", 'Tassone P', 'Boccadoro M', 'Palumbo A', 'Neri A', 'Musto P']","['Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pathology, Molecular', '*Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/04/20 06:00,2014/02/14 06:00,['2013/04/20 06:00'],"['2013/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-3461 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3461 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 15;19(12):3247-58. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3461.

Extensive research on wild type MLL and MLL-fusions has significant advanced our knowledge about their functions in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, which also provides a framework for the underlying pathogenic role of MLL re-arrangements in human leukemias. In contrast, research progress on MLL-PTD, MLL amplification and internal exonic deletion remains stagnant, in particular for the last two abnormalities where mouse model is not yet available.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cells have been reported in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and other PTCLs and may mimic Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, but EBV-negative HRS-like B cells have not been described. We wished to assess the nature of the PTCL associated with HRS-like cells and to determine whether EBV-negative HRS-like cells may be seen. We identified 57 PTCL cases reported as containing HRS-like cells. These included 32 AITL, 19 PTCL, not otherwise specified (NOS), 3 PTCL-NOS, follicular variant, 1 PTCL-NOS, T-zone variant, and 2 adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cases. All patients were adults with a median age of 63 and presented with lymphadenopathy. The male:female ratio was 31:26 (1.2:1). Clonal TRG rearrangement was detected in 46/53 cases. Six of 38 cases had a concomitant clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. In 52/57 cases the HRS cells were positive for EBV. Five cases, 3 classified as AITL and 2 as PTCL-NOS, follicular variant, contained HRS-like cells negative for EBV. All PTCLs with EBV-negative HRS cells had a T follicular helper cell immunophenotype. The neoplastic T cells expressed CD3, CD4, and PD-1 and formed rosettes around the HRS-like cells. The HRS-like cells were positive for CD20 (variable intensity), PAX5, CD30, and CD15 (4/5). We conclude that both EBV-positive and EBV-negative HRS-like B cells may occur in the background of PTCL; caution is needed to avoid misdiagnosis as classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The close interaction between the HRS-like cells and the rosetting PD-1-positive T cells suggests a possible pathogenetic role in this phenomenon and provides new insights into the abnormal B-cell proliferations that occur in the context of TFH malignancies.","['Nicolae, Alina', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Venkataraman, Girish', 'Vijnovich-Baron, Anahi', 'Xi, Liqiang', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Jaffe, Elaine S']","['Nicolae A', 'Pittaluga S', 'Venkataraman G', 'Vijnovich-Baron A', 'Xi L', 'Raffeld M', 'Jaffe ES']","['Hematopathology Section section signMolecular Diagnostics Unit, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. elainejaffe@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/immunology/*pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*pathology/virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*pathology']",PMC3654051,2013/04/20 06:00,2013/07/19 06:00,['2013/04/20 06:00'],"['2013/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e3182785610 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2013 Jun;37(6):816-26. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3182785610.,6,,,,,['ZIA SC000550-32/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS420738'],,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the roles of metal transporters in hyperaccumulation of cadmium and manganese in RBL-2H3 cells, Cd-resistant and Mn-resistant cells were developed from RBL-2H3 cells by continuous exposure to CdCl2 and MnCl2, respectively. The established Cd-resistant (RBL-Cdr) and Mn-resistant (RBL-Mnr) cells exhibited about 20 times higher LC50 values of CdCl2 and MnCl2, respectively, than parental RBL-2H3 cells, and showed cross-resistance to each metal. The resistance to cadmium and manganese was primarily conferred by a marked decrease in the uptake of both metals. RBL-Cdr cells also showed cross-resistance to HgCl2 and AgNO3 probably due to enhanced expression of metallothionein. Among the possible transporters involved in the uptake of Cd(2+) and Mn(2+), the expression of ZIP8 (Zrt-, Irt-related protein 8), encoded by Slc39a8, showed a marked suppression in both RBL-Cdr and RBL-Mnr cells.

However, existing gradient makers are designed for non-physiological plastic or glass cell culture substrates that are often limited in maintaining the phenotype and function of difficult-to-culture mammalian cell types, such as stem cells. To address this bottleneck, we combine hydrogel engineering and microfluidics to generate tethered protein gradients on the surface of biomimetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels. Here we used software-assisted hydrodynamic flow focusing for exposing and rapidly capturing tagged proteins to gels in a step-wise fashion, resulting in immobilized gradients of virtually any desired shape and composition. To render our strategy amenable for high-throughput screening of multifactorial artificial cellular microenvironments, a dedicated microfluidic chip was devised for parallelization and multiplexing, yielding arrays of orthogonally overlapping gradients of up to 4 x 4 proteins. To illustrate the power of the platform for stem cell biology, we assessed how gradients of tethered leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) influence embryonic stem cell (ESC) behavior. ESC responded to LIF gradients in a binary manner, maintaining the pluripotency marker Rex1/Zfp42 and forming self-renewing colonies above a threshold concentration of 85 ng cm(-2). Our concept should be broadly applicable to probe how complex signaling microenvironments influence stem cell fate in culture.","['Cosson, Steffen', 'Allazetta, Simone', 'Lutolf, Matthias P']","['Cosson S', 'Allazetta S', 'Lutolf MP']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell Bioengineering, Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Station 15, Bldg.

Here, for the first time we demonstrate that E6-associated protein (E6AP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase targets C/EBPalpha for ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation and thereby negatively modulates its functions. Wild-type E6AP promotes ubiquitin dependent proteasome degradation of C/EBPalpha, while catalytically inactive E6-associated protein having cysteine replaced with alanine at amino-acid position 843 (E6AP-C843A) rather stabilizes it. Further, these two proteins physically associate both in non-myeloid (overexpressed human embryonic kidney epithelium) and myeloid cells. We show that E6AP-mediated degradation of C/EBPalpha protein expression curtails its transactivation potential on its target genes. Noticeably, E6AP degrades both wild-type 42 kDa CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha (p42C/EBPalpha) and mutant isoform 30 kDa CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha (p30C/EBPalpha), this may explain perturbed p42C/EBPalpha/p30C/EBPalpha ratio often observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that overexpression of catalytically inactive E6AP-C843A in C/EBPalpha inducible K562- p42C/EBPalpha-estrogen receptor (ER) cells inhibits beta-estradiol (E2)-induced C/EBPalpha degradation leading to enhanced granulocytic differentiation. This enhanced granulocytic differentiation upon E2-induced activation of C/EBPalpha in C/EBPalpha stably transfected cells (beta-estradiol inducible K562 cells stably expressing p42C/EBPalpha-ER (K562-C/EBPalpha-p42-ER)) was further substantiated by siE6AP-mediated knockdown of E6AP in both K562-C/EBPalpha-p42-ER and 32dcl3 (32D clone 3, a cell line widely used model for in vitro study of hematopoietic cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis) cells. Taken together, our data suggest that E6AP targeted C/EBPalpha protein degradation may provide a possible explanation for both loss of expression and/or functional inactivation of C/EBPalpha often experienced in myeloid leukemia.","['Pal, P', 'Lochab, S', 'Kanaujiya, J K', 'Kapoor, I', 'Sanyal, S', 'Behre, G', 'Trivedi, A K']","['Pal P', 'Lochab S', 'Kanaujiya JK', 'Kapoor I', 'Sanyal S', 'Behre G', 'Trivedi AK']","['Drug Target Discovery and Development Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Sector-10, Jankipuram Extension, Lucknow, UP 226021, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3641343,2013/04/20 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/04/20 06:00'],"['2013/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013120 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.120 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Apr 18;4:e590. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.120.,,,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (UBE3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a meta-analysis to determine the magnitude of abandonment in paediatric leukaemia in LMIC and sought to identify patient-, centre- and country-specific predictors of abandonment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched seven databases to identify paediatric oncology cohorts followed up from diagnosis and treated in LMIC. All languages were included. Two reviewers independently selected articles and extracted data. Authors were contacted for additional information. Subgroup analyses were planned a priori. RESULTS: Of 22,384 publications, 318 in eight languages met criteria for full text review. 157 studies met analysis inclusion criteria. Abandonment rates (ARs), obtained for 83 of the 157 studies (52.9%), ranged from 0% to 74.5%. ARs were frequently unreported and available only directly from authors. Forty studies (10,494 children in 20 countries) were quantitatively analysed. ARs for acute lymphoblastic laeukemia in lower-middle-income countries (lower-MICs) were higher than in upper-middle-income countries (29%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23-36% versus 2%, 95% CI 1-3%; p<0.0001) but were heterogeneous (I(2)=98%; p<0.0001). This heterogeneity was not explained by centre-specific (free versus paid treatment) or country-specific (government health expenditure, per-capital income) subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In LMICs, ARs are highest in lower-MICs. However, their broad range suggests that low ARs are possible in resource-constrained settings. Analysis of outliers may suggest interventions for use at other centres. Methodologically appropriate reporting of ARs should be adopted. Future research should evaluate interventions targeting abandonment.","['Gupta, Sumit', 'Yeh, Stacy', 'Martiniuk, Alexandra', 'Lam, Catherine G', 'Chen, Heui-Yang', 'Liu, Yen-Lin', 'Tsimicalis, Argerie', 'Arora, Ramandeep S', 'Ribeiro, Raul C']","['Gupta S', 'Yeh S', 'Martiniuk A', 'Lam CG', 'Chen HY', 'Liu YL', 'Tsimicalis A', 'Arora RS', 'Ribeiro RC']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.

In this study, we found that resveratrol has therapeutic activity as a single agent in vivo in both human chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and mice with erythroleukemia.

Resveratrol directly lowered O-GlcNAc levels in leukemia cells through proteasomal activation, but increasing O-GlcNAc levels in vitro did not prevent cell death.

Novel therapeutical agents interfere with these microenvironmental interactions, and include inhibitors of kinases Syk, Btk and PI3Kdelta. In this review we will focus on the microenvironmental interactions of CLL and the role of tyrosine kinases.

METHODS: The expression levels of CD44 in four leukemia cell lines SHI-1, THP-1, NB4 and K562 were assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot when they were in logarithmic phase. And these cell lines were divided into control group (treated with same species and isotype IgG) and experimental group (treated with anti-CD44 mono-clonal antibody). The assays of cell-cell adhesion to endothelial cells line ECV304, migration through the artificial matrix membrane and infiltration through the Matrigel were performed. RESULTS: The relative expression ratios of CD44 to GAPDH in SHI-1, THP-1, NB4 cells were 0.0731 +/- 0.0072, 0.0827 +/- 0.0151 and 0.1473 +/- 0.0365, respectively, which were significantly higher than that in K562 cells (0.0002 +/- 0.0000, P < 0.01). Cell-cell adhesion assay showed that the adhesion rates of SHI-1, THP-1 and NB4 cells in the experimental group decreased to 72.78%, 64.09% and 57.42%, respectively, and were lower than those of the control groups, while that of K562 cells in the experimental group was 106.16%. Migration assay showed that the transmembrane rates of SHI-1,THP-1 and NB4 cells were 55%, 29% and 25% in the control group, respectively, and decreased to 32%, 18% and 12% in the experimental group, respectively, while those of K562 cells in both control group and experimental group remained 2%.

SUV39H1 siRNA down-regulated histone tri-methylated-H3K9 by 25%, 33% and 49% compared to control group when treated with SUV39H1 siRNA at 30, 60 and 120 nmol/L for 48 hours, while up-regulated histone acetylated H3K9 by 1.83, 2.16 and 3.07 folds, and global histone H3 in 1.35, 1.87 and 2.37 folds, but no changes were observed in histone acetylation of H3K14, H3K27 and H4. Expression of p15 increased 1.52, 2.89 and 3.08 folds after SUV39H1 siRNA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: SUV39H1 gene silencing could induce the re-expression of p15 and inhibit cell proliferation by down-regulation of histone methylation of H3K9, up-regulation of histone acetylation of H3K9 and global H3. SUV39H1 might be a new target for cancer therapy.","['Zhao, Ting', 'Ma, Xu-dong', 'Huang, Yi-qun']","['Zhao T', 'Ma XD', 'Huang YQ']","['Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*RNA, Small Interfering', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics']",,2013/04/20 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/04/20 06:00'],"['2013/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jan;34(1):49-54.,1,,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.

METHODS: Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of 112 imatinib resistant CML patients and 21 Ph(+)ALL patients were obtained from the first affiliated hospital of Soochow university according to local law. Total RNA was extracted from the mononuclear cells using a TRIzol reagent. ABL kinase domain (KD) mutation was detected by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 112 imatinib resistant CML patients, 54.46%(61 cases) had ABL KD mutation. Twenty-three mutants were identified in 20 amino acid sites and 23.21% (26 cases) ABL KD mutations were in P-loop region. ABL KD mutations were also detected in 71.43% (15 cases) imatinib resistant Ph(+)ALL patients, with 10 mutations in 8 amino acid sites. The most frequent mutation was T315I (28.57%), followed by E255K/V (19.05%) and Y253F/H (14.29%). The frequency of T315I was much higher in imatinib resistant Ph(+) ALL than that in imatinib resistant CML (P = 0.001). Ph(+)ALL with additional chromosomal aberrations also had a higher rate of ABL KD mutation than that of CML (P = 0.010). Ph(+)ALL gained ABL KD mutation faster than CML (P < 0.010).

METHODS: Serum proteins from 36 cases of primary APL, 29 cases of APL during complete remission and 32 healthy controls were purified by magnetic beads and then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The spectra were analyzed statistically using FlexAnalysis(TM) and ClinProt(TM) software. RESULTS: Two prediction model of primary APL/healthy control, primary APL/APL CR were developed. Thirty four statistically significant peptide peaks were obtained with the m/z value ranging from 1000 to 10 000 (P < 0.001) in primary APL/healthy control model.

METHODS: The clinical data of 116 AML patients older than 60 years in the department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2000 to December 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. All patients received cytarabine-based regimens, including protocol DA, MA, IA, AA or CAG, followed by cytarabine-based postremission treatment. (1) Comorbidities were evaluated by using HCT-CI score, the early death rates and median survival time were compared among these different groups. (2) These prognostic factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: (1) All 116 cases were followed-up.

Multivariate and univariate analysis of clinical data were performed using a Cox regression model and log-rank test, including age, subtype, performance status, white blood cell count, serum LDH and albumin level, and treatment strategy. RESULTS: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients had longer survival than other subtypes. To rule out the impact of APL on the prognostic analysis, we conducted multivariate and univariate analysis excluding APL patients. The significant parameters of the univariate analysis were age (P = 0.003), achieving remission (P < 0.01), performance status (P < 0.01), organ dysfunction (P < 0.01), increased WBC counts (P = 0.022), increased LDH level (P = 0.006) and low albumin level (P < 0.01).

The approach has been hampered in most of human cell lines, however, by the poor targeting efficiency. Nalm-6, a human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, exhibits exceptionally high gene targeting efficiency and is used in DNA repair and the related research fields. Nonetheless, usage of the cell line is still limited partly because it lacks expression of MSH2, a component of mismatch repair complex, which leads to increased genome instability. Here, we report successful restoration of MSH2 expression in Nalm-6 cells and demonstrate that the recovery does not affect the high targeting efficiency. We recovered the expression by introduction of cDNA sequences corresponding to exons 9 to 16 at downstream of exon 8 of the MSH2 gene. Endogenous exons 9 to 16 were deleted in the cell line. The MSH2 expression substantially reduced spontaneous HPRT mutation frequency. Moreover, gene targeting efficiency in the MSH2-expressing cells was similar to that in the MSH2-lacking cells. In fact, we generated heterozygously REV3L knockout and the catalytically dead mutants in the MSH2-proficient Nalm-6 cells with efficiency of 20-30%. The established cell line, Nalm-6-MSH+, is useful for reverse genetics in human cells.","['Suzuki, Tetsuya', 'Ukai, Akiko', 'Honma, Masamitsu', 'Adachi, Noritaka', 'Nohmi, Takehiko']","['Suzuki T', 'Ukai A', 'Honma M', 'Adachi N', 'Nohmi T']","['Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130415,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', '*DNA Mismatch Repair', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Gene Order', '*Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Loci', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",PMC3626652,2013/04/19 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0061189 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-30872 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 15;8(4):e61189. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061189.

Imatinib mesylate (IM), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, has been used as a first-line therapy for CML. However, IM is less effective in the accelerated phase and blastic phases of CML and certain patients develop IM resistance due to the mutation and amplification of the BCR-ABL gene. Fangchinoline, an important chemical constituent from the dried roots of Stephaniae tetrandrae S. Moore, exhibits significant antitumor activity in various types of cancers, including breast, prostate and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the effects and the underlying mechanisms of fangchinoline in CML remain unclear. In the present study, we identified that fangchinoline inhibits cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in K562 cells derived from the blast crisis of CML. Additional experiments revealed that fangchinoline induces cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and has no effect on apoptosis, which is mediated through the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-N1A and MCL-1 mRNA levels, as well as the downregulation of cyclin D2 (CCND2) mRNA levels. These findings suggest the potential of fangchinoline as an effective antitumor agent in CML.","['Wang, Yuping', 'Chen, Jie', 'Wang, Lin', 'Huang, Yuji', 'Leng, Ye', 'Wang, Guiying']","['Wang Y', 'Chen J', 'Wang L', 'Huang Y', 'Leng Y', 'Wang G']","['Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092; ; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Jinggangshan University, Jiangxi 343009;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130124,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,PMC3627453,2013/04/19 06:00,2013/04/19 06:01,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2013.924 [doi]', 'etm-05-04-1105 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2013 Apr;5(4):1105-1112. doi: 10.3892/etm.2013.924.

We performed a large-scale chemical library screen that integrated a high-throughput enzyme inhibition assay, in silico binding prediction, and crystal structure determination and found a candidate HCK inhibitor, RK-20449, a pyrrolo-pyrimidine derivative with an enzymatic IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) in the subnanomolar range. A crystal structure revealed that RK-20449 bound the activation pocket of HCK. In vivo administration of RK-20449 to nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)/IL2rg(null) mice engrafted with highly aggressive therapy-resistant AML significantly reduced human LSC and non-stem AML burden.

The present study used a preclinical mouse model to investigate the effects of early exposure to common ALL chemotherapeutics methotrexate (MTX) and cytarabine (Ara-C) on learning and memory. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Preweanling mouse pups were treated on postnatal day (PND) 14, 15, and 16 with saline, MTX, Ara-C, or a combination of MTX and Ara-C. Nineteen days after treatment (PND 35), behavioral tasks measuring different aspects of learning and memory were administered. RESULTS: Significant impairment in acquisition and retention over both short (1 hour) and long (24 hours) intervals, as measured by autoshaping and novel object recognition tasks, was found following treatment with MTX and Ara-C. Similarly, a novel conditional discrimination task revealed impairment in acquisition for chemotherapy-treated mice. No significant group differences were found following the extensive training component of this task, with impairment following the rapid training component occurring only for the highest MTX and Ara-C combination group. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with those from clinical studies suggesting that childhood cancer survivors are slower at learning new information and primarily exhibit deficits in memory years after successful completion of chemotherapy.

Recently, somatic mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene were discovered in 28% to 40% of LGL leukemia patients. By exome and transcriptome sequencing of 2 STAT3 mutation-negative LGL leukemia patients, we identified a recurrent, somatic missense mutation (Y665F) in the Src-like homology 2 domain of the STAT5b gene. Targeted amplicon sequencing of 211 LGL leukemia patients revealed 2 additional patients with STAT5b mutations (N642H), resulting in a total frequency of 2% (4 of 211) of STAT5b mutations across all patients. The Y665F and N642H mutant constructs increased the transcriptional activity of STAT5 and tyrosine (Y694) phosphorylation, which was also observed in patient samples. The clinical course of the disease in patients with the N642H mutation was aggressive and fatal, clearly different from typical LGL leukemia with a relatively favorable outcome. This is the first time somatic STAT5 mutations are discovered in human cancer and further emphasizes the role of STAT family genes in the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia.","['Rajala, Hanna L M', 'Eldfors, Samuli', 'Kuusanmaki, Heikki', 'van Adrichem, Arjan J', 'Olson, Thomas', 'Lagstrom, Sonja', 'Andersson, Emma I', 'Jerez, Andres', 'Clemente, Michael J', 'Yan, Yiyi', 'Zhang, Dan', 'Awwad, Andy', 'Ellonen, Pekka', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Wennerberg, Krister', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Heckman, Caroline', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Rajala HL', 'Eldfors S', 'Kuusanmaki H', 'van Adrichem AJ', 'Olson T', 'Lagstrom S', 'Andersson EI', 'Jerez A', 'Clemente MJ', 'Yan Y', 'Zhang D', 'Awwad A', 'Ellonen P', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Wennerberg K', 'Porkka K', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Heckman C', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130417,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dimerization', 'Exome/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics']",PMC3668487,2013/04/19 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58443-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-12-474577 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 30;121(22):4541-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-12-474577.

HC-MBL is associated with lymphocytosis and progresses to CLL requiring treatment at a rate of 1.1% per year, whereas LC-MBL is found in the general population only through high-sensitivity techniques and carries limited, if any, risk of progression. We performed an immunogenetic profiling of 333 cases with CLL-like MBL supplemented by detailed comparisons with CLL, focusing especially on CLL Rai stage 0 (CLL-0). LC- and HC-MBL had similar somatic hypermutation status, yet different IGHV gene repertoires and frequencies of B-cell receptor (BcR) stereotypy. In particular, stereotyped BcRs were infrequent in LC-MBL and were often not CLL specific. In contrast, HC-MBL exhibited clear immunogenetic similarities to CLL-0.

Both a change in conformation (affinity) and clustering (avidity/valency) of the receptors occurs, but the mechanisms that regulate inside out signaling are not completely understood. Previously, we identified gelsolin in a proteomics screen to identify proteins involved in inside-out control of integrins using the lymphocytic leukemia cell line L1210. Furthermore, we showed that gelsolin was involved in affinity regulation of beta1 -integrins in the leukemic cell line U937. Here, we examined how gelsolin regulates beta1 -integrin affinity in the leukemia cell line L1210. We show that gelsolin is mainly expressed at the cell membrane and is present near beta1 -integrins. The role for actin polymerization in integrin affinity regulation was examined using the actin modulating agent jasplakinolide, which decreased beta1 -integrin affinity. Similarly, knock-down of gelsolin in L1210 cells also decreased beta1 -integrin affinity and cell adhesion to collagen. These data suggest that increased actin polymerization through gelsolin regulates beta1 -integrin affinity and cell adhesion.","['Langereis, Jeroen D', 'Koenderman, Leo', 'Huttenlocher, Anna', 'Ulfman, Laurien H']","['Langereis JD', 'Koenderman L', 'Huttenlocher A', 'Ulfman LH']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130510,United States,Cytoskeleton (Hoboken),"Cytoskeleton (Hoboken, N.J.)",101523844,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gelsolin/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/deficiency/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4074084,2013/04/19 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cm.21112 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytoskeleton (Hoboken). 2013 Jul;70(7):385-93. doi: 10.1002/cm.21112.

Here, on the basis of phospholipidomics, we focused on the relative quantity of PDLs extracted from mammalian thymus or bone marrow using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS). In phospholipid analysis, we identified 12 classes of phospholipids and accounted for their relative quantities by comparing their relative abundances in the MS(1) map. Our results show that PDLs are present in mammalian thymus as well as mouse spleen and liver. Interestingly, the relative quantity of PDLs extracted from human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) bone marrows is higher than that extracted from bone marrow of healthy donors. Our results may help to explain the close correlation between PDLs and iNKT cell function in thymus, spleen, liver, and especially in leukemia patients.

Different cellular stresses, including antitumor agents, ionizing radiation and ultraviolet (UV) light, can induce apoptosis and activate signaling pathways. UV has multiple effects on tumor cells, including DNA damage, and increases the expression of some genes involved in tumor cell apoptosis and DNA repair. It has been reported that UV can also activate casein kinase 2 (CK2). CK2, a Ser/Thr protein kinase, has been reported to be frequently overexpressed in various types of human cancer, including lung cancer, and is associated with tumor development. Thus, combination of UV and CK2 inhibitors may be a new strategy for the treatment of lung cancer. Our results demonstrated that inhibition of CK2a through CK2 siRNA or a CK2 inhibitor [(4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB)] enhances the decrease in cell viability of lung cancer cells (A549 and H2030) induced by UV. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the combination increased the expression of apoptotic protein markers cytochrome c and the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3. Furthermore, our results indicated that UV decreased the expression of the tumor suppressor protein PML through activation of CK2. Inhibition of CK2 by CK2 siRNA and TBB can recover the reduction of PML induced by UV. Collectively, these results demonstrate the significant apoptosis of lung cancer cells induced by combination treatment of the CK2 inhibitor and UV radiation. CK2 enhanced cell apoptosis by UV radiation may due, at least partly, to recover the expression of PML. These findings warrant the clinical testing of CK2 inhibitors which, when used in conjunction with DNA-damaging agents such as radiation, may be an effective cancer therapeutic strategy.","['Zhao, Tiesuo', 'Jia, Huijie', 'Li, Lifei', 'Zhang, Guoliang', 'Zhao, Min', 'Cheng, Qian', 'Zheng, Junnian', 'Li, Di']","['Zhao T', 'Jia H', 'Li L', 'Zhang G', 'Zhao M', 'Cheng Q', 'Zheng J', 'Li D']","['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biological Cancer Therapy, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221002, P.R.

Toxicity reported in pediatric cancer patients treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 2004 to 2010 were abstracted from a cancer tumor registry and merged with drug order profiles from the medical record system. Analysis datasets were created in SAS and permutation algorithms were used to identify pairwise drug combinations associated with specific toxicity occurrence. Relative risk of toxicity based on dosing pattern was assessed via comparison to control patients. A total of 326 of 1,713 patients (19%) had reportable toxicities. Neutrophil count decreases and alanine aminotransferase increases represented the highest occurring, corresponding to 28.8% and 31.9% prevalence among patients reporting toxicity, respectively. Of coadministered drug pairs, acetaminophen-diphenhydramine occurred most frequently; however, methotrexate-vincristine was the highest occurring pair linked to a single toxicity (hepatotoxicity). Toxicity was highly associated with the diagnoses of leukemia (52.1%) or neuroblastoma (28.5%). Comparison of the dosing interval (</=30 versus >30 min) suggested that risk of toxicity can be associated with the timing of coadministration, with </=30 min increasing the risk of hepatotoxicity with fentanyl-midazolam and methotrexate-midazolam combinations.

It is a biologically active disease characterized by numerous cytogenetic abnormalities and multiple genetic mutations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) will perhaps not reveal all the factors that make AML a complex disease, but does have the potential to affect the diagnosis and risk stratification of AML patients and allow more personalized therapy. AML cells are easy to obtain from the patient and samples are only minimally contaminated with normal cells, which makes it an attractive cancer to study. Several studies have now demonstrated that the majority of AML patients are cytogenetically normal and the genome of these patients may contain fewer mutations than cancer genomes that are highly aneuploidy, suggesting that mutations in diploid genomes are more likely to be pathogenetically relevant. Whole-genome, exome, transcriptome, and targeted gene sequencing studies have been conducted successfully in AML and have provided with valuable information. The challenges for the future include: reducing the cost of sequencing, understanding epigenetic changes, managing data across various platforms, separating the driver mutations from the sea of passenger mutations, and finally, educating future generations to allow a better understanding and easy availability of these complex methodologies.","['Rao, Arati V', 'Smith, B Douglas']","['Rao AV', 'Smith BD']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cell Therapy, Duke University Medical Center, 2400 Pratt Street, Suite 9010, Durham, NC 27710, USA. arati.rao@dm.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Decision Making', 'Exome', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",PMC3690575,2013/04/19 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-013-0161-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2013 Jun;8(2):149-55. doi: 10.1007/s11899-013-0161-6.,2,,,,,['R03 AG042362/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS469484'],,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to analyse the frequency of SF3B1 mutations in a large cohort of 111 patients with RARS-T and 33 patients with RARS and to explore the prognostic impact of SF3B1 mutational status on RARS-T. The frequency of SF3B1 mutations in RARS-T (96/111, 86.5%) and RARS (28/33, 84.8%) was similar. In RARS-T, median survival was better in SF3B1-mutated patients than in SF3B1-non-mutated patients (6.9 and 3.3 years, respectively, P=0.003). RARS can be differentiated from RARS-T by the frequency of JAK2(V617F) (0% vs 48.6%). In RARS-T patients, SF3B1 (P=0.021) and JAK2 mutations (P=0.016) were independent factors for a better prognosis.

The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice. BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.","['Pakneshan, Sahar', 'Salajegheh, Ali', 'Smith, Robert Anthony', 'Lam, Alfred King-Yin']","['Pakneshan S', 'Salajegheh A', 'Smith RA', 'Lam AK']","['Cancer Molecular Pathology, Griffith Health Institute, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/secondary', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Point Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology']",,2013/04/19 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAT.0b013e328360b61d [doi]', 'S0031302516315392 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathology. 2013 Jun;45(4):346-56. doi: 10.1097/PAT.0b013e328360b61d.,4,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to identify the clinical and functional association of microRNA-20a (miR-20a) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: MiR-20a was detected using Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses were utilized to determine the association of miR-20a with survival of patients. The potential functions of miR-20a on proliferation were evaluated by proliferation and flow cytometry analysis. The direct target gene of miR-20a was also identified by luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: MiR-20a was lower in primary HCC than normal liver, and were further decreased in those with post-liver transplantation (LT) HCC recurrence compared with those with non-recurrence (p = 0.001). Patients with lower miR-20a expression had significantly poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS, Log rank p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS, Log rank p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that lower miR-20a was an independent predictor of poor prognosis. MiR-20a restoration could suppress HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells proliferation and induce cell cycle G1 arrest and apoptosis. Subsequent investigations revealed that miR-20a directly targeted myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) and reduced the endogenous protein level of Mcl-1 in HCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-20a is decreased in HCCs and correlates with HCC recurrence and prognosis. Down-regulation of miR-20a increases the proliferation abilities of HCC cells. Our findings suggest miR-20a may represent a novel potential therapeutic target and biomarker for survival of HCC patients.","['Fan, Ming-Qi', 'Huang, Chi-Bing', 'Gu, Yan', 'Xiao, Ya', 'Sheng, Jin-Xin', 'Zhong, Lin']","['Fan MQ', 'Huang CB', 'Gu Y', 'Xiao Y', 'Sheng JX', 'Zhong L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3699415,2013/04/19 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2013/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-32-21 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-32-21 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Apr 18;32(1):21. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-32-21.,1,,"['0 (MIRN20a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy and durability of this potentially toxic regimen in this setting is unclear. We identified 75 patients who received D(T)PACE for relapsed/refractory MM at two tertiary care centres: Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto and Mayo Clinic Arizona. At time of D(T)PACE, 16 patients had PCL and three patients had leptomeningeal disease. Patients were heavily pretreated (median three prior regimens, range 1-12; prior autologous stem cell transplant [ASCT] 33%). Overall response rate was 49% (very-good partial response 16%, partial response 33%) with stable disease in an additional 36%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]:4.3-9.8); overall survival (OS) 14.0 months (95% CI:8.7-19.3). Thirty-five patients proceeded to ASCT or clinical trial, with median PFS for this subset of 13.4 months (95% CI:7.7-20.1) and OS 20.5 months (95% CI:14.8-63.8). D(T)PACE is an effective salvage therapy for heavily pretreated MM patients. Although the overall response rate of 49% in this poor prognosis cohort is reasonable, the PFS is short, suggesting the best role for D(T)PACE is in bridging to definitive therapy, such as transplantation.","['Gerrie, Alina S', 'Mikhael, Joseph R', 'Cheng, Lu', 'Jiang, Haiyan', 'Kukreti, Vishal', 'Panzarella, Tony', 'Reece, Donna', 'Stewart, Keith A', 'Trieu, Young', 'Trudel, Suzanne', 'Chen, Christine I']","['Gerrie AS', 'Mikhael JR', 'Cheng L', 'Jiang H', 'Kukreti V', 'Panzarella T', 'Reece D', 'Stewart KA', 'Trieu Y', 'Trudel S', 'Chen CI']","['Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. agerrie@bccancer.bc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/04/19 06:00,2013/08/02 06:00,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12325 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Jun;161(6):802-10. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12325.

Imaginal coping, as a theoretical construct, is defined as the use of imagination to deal with the hardships of illness. The overarching aim has been to investigate the various ways in which categories of staff members (doctors, nurses, play therapists, and hospital clowns) and parents support children in their coping. Focus has thus been on collaborative or interactive aspects of playful coping. METHOD: A large proportion of the data collected consists of 93 h of video-recorded interactions between children, parents and staff. The collection of data involved fieldwork carried out with the use of a video ethnographic method, making it possible thereby to analyse and work with data in greater detail. For more than one year, five children with leukaemia were followed as each made their regular visits to a children's cancer clinic in a children's hospital in Sweden. RESULTS: Collaborative storytelling, humorous treatment practices, playful rituals, as well as role-reversal play, were all types of events involving staff-child collaboration and creative improvisation. CONCLUSIONS: Staff, along with parents, played a significant role in the coping process. In various ways, the staff members helped the parents to respond to their children in ways adaptive for coping. It can be seen that imaginal coping is a highly interactional business. In this study it is shown that parents socialize coping; this is sometimes undertaken explicitly, for example, through coaching (in the form of instructions or suggestions) and teaching. But often it is achieved through modelling or intent participation, with the child observing staff members' treatment practices.","['Rindstedt, C']",['Rindstedt C'],"['Department of Child and Youth Studies, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,England,Child Care Health Dev,"Child: care, health and development",7602632,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Anthropology, Cultural', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Communication', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Parents', '*Play Therapy', 'Sweden', 'Video Recording']",,2013/04/19 06:00,2015/09/15 06:00,['2013/04/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cch.12064 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Care Health Dev. 2014 Jul;40(4):580-6. doi: 10.1111/cch.12064.

In most adult patients, systemic mastocytosis (SM) is diagnosed. Based on histopathological findings and organ damage, SM is divided into indolent SM (ISM), smoldering SM (SSM), SM with an associated hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), aggressive SM (ASM), and MC leukemia (MCL). The clinical course and prognosis vary greatly among these groups of patients. In all variants of SM and most patients, neoplastic cells display the KIT mutation D816V. This suggests that additional KIT-independent molecular defects cause progression. Indeed, additional oncogenic lesions, including RAS- and TET2 mutations, have recently been identified in advanced SM. In patients with SM-AHNMD, such additional lesions are often detectable in the 'AHNMD-component' of the disease. Clinically relevant symptoms of SM result from i) malignant MC infiltration and the subsequent organ damage seen in advanced SM and/or ii) the release of pro-inflammatory and vasoactive mediators from MC, found in all disease-variants. Therapy of SM has to be adjusted to the individual situation in each patient. In ISM, the aim is to control mediator release and mediator effects. In advanced SM, a major goal is to control MC expansion by using conventional drugs or novel targeted drugs directed against mutant forms of KIT and/or other pro-oncogenic kinase-targets. In rapidly progressing ASM, MCL and drug-resistant AHNMD, chemotherapy and subsequent stem cell transplantation has to be considered.","['Valent, Peter']",['Valent P'],"['Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Wahringer Gurtel 18-20 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130403,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,PMC3623836,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/04/18 06:01,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/18 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2013 Apr 3;3(2):159-72.

There is limited information however on ROR1 in melanoma. In the present study we analysed in seven melanoma cell lines ROR1 expression and phosphorylation as well as the effects of anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and ROR1 suppressing siRNA on cell survival. ROR1 was overexpressed at the protein level to a varying degree and phosphorylated at tyrosine and serine residues. Three of our four self-produced anti-ROR1 mAbs (clones 3H9, 5F1 and 1A8) induced a significant direct apoptosis of the ESTDAB049, ESTDAB112, DFW and A375 cell lines as well as cell death in complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The ESTDAB081 and 094 cell lines respectively were resistant to direct apoptosis of the four anti-ROR1 mAbs alone but not in CDC or ADCC. ROR1 siRNA transfection induced downregulation of ROR1 expression both at mRNA and protein levels proceeded by apoptosis of the melanoma cells (ESTDAB049, ESTDAB112, DFW and A375) including ESTDAB081, which was resistant to the direct apoptotic effect of the mAbs. The results indicate that ROR1 may play a role in the survival of melanoma cells. The surface expression of ROR1 on melanoma cells may support the notion that ROR1 might be a suitable target for mAb therapy.","['Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Ghaemimanesh, Fatemeh', 'Daneshmanesh, Amir Hossein', 'Bayat, Ali-Ahmad', 'Mahmoudian, Jafar', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Rabbani, Hodjatallah', 'Mellstedt, Hakan']","['Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Ghaemimanesh F', 'Daneshmanesh AH', 'Bayat AA', 'Mahmoudian J', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Rabbani H', 'Mellstedt H']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130408,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement System Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/deficiency/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism']",PMC3620154,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0061167 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-21461 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 8;8(4):e61167. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061167.

Alteration of viral env sequences is thought to be associated with disease specificity, but the way in which genetic diversity of FeLV contributes to the generation of such variants in nature is poorly understood. We isolated FeLV env genes from naturally infected cats in Japan and analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of these genes. Phylogenetic reconstructions separated our FeLV samples into three distinct genetic clusters, termed Genotypes I, II, and III. Genotype I is a major genetic cluster and can be further classified into Clades 1-7 in Japan. Genotypes were correlated with geographical distribution; Genotypes I and II were distributed within Japan, whilst FeLV samples from outside Japan belonged to Genotype III. These results may be due to geographical isolation of FeLVs in Japan. The observed structural diversity of the FeLV env gene appears to be caused primarily by mutation, deletion, insertion and recombination, and these variants may be generated de novo in individual cats. FeLV interference assay revealed that FeLV genotypes did not correlate with known FeLV receptor subgroups. We have identified the genotypes which we consider to be reliable for evaluating phylogenetic relationships of FeLV, which embrace the high structural diversity observed in our sample. Overall, these findings extend our understanding of Gammaretrovirus evolutionary patterns in the field, and may provide a useful basis for assessing the emergence of novel strains and understanding the molecular mechanisms of FeLV transmission in cats.","['Watanabe, Shinya', 'Kawamura, Maki', 'Odahara, Yuka', 'Anai, Yukari', 'Ochi, Haruyo', 'Nakagawa, So', 'Endo, Yasuyuki', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Watanabe S', 'Kawamura M', 'Odahara Y', 'Anai Y', 'Ochi H', 'Nakagawa S', 'Endo Y', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats/*virology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Demography', 'Genes, env/*genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Japan', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/classification/*genetics', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC3623909,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0061009 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-39760 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 11;8(4):e61009. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061009.

The cytokine exerts pro-tumorigenic activity through activation of several signaling pathways in particular signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Hence, targeting IL-6 is becoming increasingly attractive as a treatment option in ovarian cancer. Here, we investigated the effects of minocycline on IL-6 and its signaling pathways in ovarian cancer. In vitro, minocycline was found to significantly suppress both constitutive and IL-1beta or 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OH-E2)-stimulated IL-6 expression in human ovarian cancer cells; OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 and CAOV-3. Moreover, minocycline down-regulated two major components of IL-6 receptor system (IL-6Ralpha and gp130) and blocked the activation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways leading to suppression of the downstream product MCL-1. In female nude mice bearing intraperitoneal OVCAR-3 tumors, acute administration (4 and 24 h) of minocycline (30 mg/kg) led to suppression of IL-6. Even single dose of minocycline was effective at significantly lowering plasma and tumor IL-6 levels. In line with this, tumoral expression of p-STAT3, p-ERK1/2 and MCL-1 were decreased in minocycline-treated mice. Evaluation of the functional implication of minocycline on metastatic activity revealed the capacity of minocycline to inhibit cellular migration, invasion and adhesion associated with down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and 9. Thus, the data suggest a potential role for minocycline in suppressing IL-6 expression and activity. These effects may prove to be an important attribute to the upcoming clinical trials of minocycline in ovarian cancer.","['Ataie-Kachoie, Parvin', 'Morris, David L', 'Pourgholami, Mohammad H']","['Ataie-Kachoie P', 'Morris DL', 'Pourgholami MH']","['Department of Surgery, University of New South Wales, St George Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130408,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Estrogens, Catechol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Minocycline/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC3620477,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060817 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-37939 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 8;8(4):e60817. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060817.

The primary outcome of interest for our analysis was survival (disease-free survival, event-free survival and overall survival); the secondary endpoint was complete remission. RESULTS: Ten trials with 4,060 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. Our pooled results suggest that IA is associated with a significant advantage in CR (RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.07-1.41, p = 0.004), EFS (HR = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.45-0.91, p = 0.013), and OS (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.81-0.95, p = 0.02) but not in DFS (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.80-1.00, p = 0.06).

However, for the vast majority of non-coding RNAs, the cellular function remains enigmatic. The two long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes DLEU1 and DLEU2 map to a critical region at chromosomal band 13q14.3 that is recurrently deleted in solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While no point mutations have been found in the protein coding candidate genes at 13q14.3, they are deregulated in malignant cells, suggesting an epigenetic tumor suppressor mechanism. We therefore characterized the epigenetic makeup of 13q14.3 in CLL cells and found histone modifications by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that are associated with activated transcription and significant DNA-demethylation at the transcriptional start sites of DLEU1 and DLEU2 using 5 different semi-quantitative and quantitative methods (aPRIMES, BioCOBRA, MCIp, MassARRAY, and bisulfite sequencing). These epigenetic aberrations were correlated with transcriptional deregulation of the neighboring candidate tumor suppressor genes, suggesting a coregulation in cis of this gene cluster. We found that the 13q14.3 genes in addition to their previously known functions regulate NF-kB activity, which we could show after overexpression, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and dominant-negative mutant genes by using Western blots with previously undescribed antibodies, by a customized ELISA as well as by reporter assays. In addition, we performed an unbiased screen of 810 human miRNAs and identified the miR-15/16 family of genes at 13q14.3 as the strongest inducers of NF-kB activity. In summary, the tumor suppressor mechanism at 13q14.3 is a cluster of genes controlled by two lncRNA genes that are regulated by DNA-methylation and histone modifications and whose members all regulate NF-kB. Therefore, the tumor suppressor mechanism in 13q14.3 underlines the role both of epigenetic aberrations and of lncRNA genes in human tumorigenesis and is an example of colocalization of a functionally related gene cluster.","['Garding, Angela', 'Bhattacharya, Nupur', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Ruppel, Melanie', 'Tschuch, Cordula', 'Filarsky, Katharina', 'Idler, Irina', 'Zucknick, Manuela', 'Caudron-Herger, Maiwen', 'Oakes, Christopher', 'Fleig, Verena', 'Keklikoglou, Ioanna', 'Allegra, Danilo', 'Serra, Leticia', 'Thakurela, Sudhir', 'Tiwari, Vijay', 'Weichenhan, Dieter', 'Benner, Axel', 'Radlwimmer, Bernhard', 'Zentgraf, Hanswalter', 'Wiemann, Stefan', 'Rippe, Karsten', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Mertens, Daniel']","['Garding A', 'Bhattacharya N', 'Claus R', 'Ruppel M', 'Tschuch C', 'Filarsky K', 'Idler I', 'Zucknick M', 'Caudron-Herger M', 'Oakes C', 'Fleig V', 'Keklikoglou I', 'Allegra D', 'Serra L', 'Thakurela S', 'Tiwari V', 'Weichenhan D', 'Benner A', 'Radlwimmer B', 'Zentgraf H', 'Wiemann S', 'Rippe K', 'Plass C', 'Dohner H', 'Lichter P', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Mertens D']","['Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis,"" University Ulm, German Cancer Research Center, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130404,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/blood/genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transferases', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins/blood/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3616974,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1003373 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-12-01227 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2013 Apr;9(4):e1003373. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003373.

HTLV-1 causes a neuroinflammatory disease and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Strongyloidiasis, a gastrointestinal infection by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis, and Infective Dermatitis associated with HTLV-1 (IDH), appear to be risk factors for the development of HTLV-1 related diseases. We used high-throughput sequencing to map and quantify the insertion sites of the provirus in order to monitor the clonality of the HTLV-1-infected T-cell population (i.e. the number of distinct clones and abundance of each clone). A newly developed biodiversity estimator called ""DivE"" was used to estimate the total number of clones in the blood. We found that the major determinant of proviral load in all subjects without leukemia/lymphoma was the total number of HTLV-1-infected clones. Nevertheless, the significantly higher proviral load in patients with strongyloidiasis or IDH was due to an increase in the mean clone abundance, not to an increase in the number of infected clones. These patients appear to be less capable of restricting clone abundance than those with HTLV-1 alone. In patients co-infected with Strongyloides there was an increased degree of oligoclonal expansion and a higher rate of turnover (i.e. appearance and disappearance) of HTLV-1-infected clones. In Strongyloides co-infected patients and those with IDH, proliferation of the most abundant HTLV-1(+) T-cell clones is independent of the genomic environment of the provirus, in sharp contrast to patients with HTLV-1 infection alone. This implies that new selection forces are driving oligoclonal proliferation in Strongyloides co-infection and IDH. We conclude that strongyloidiasis and IDH increase the risk of development of HTLV-1-associated diseases by increasing the rate of infection of new clones and the abundance of existing HTLV-1(+) clones.","['Gillet, Nicolas A', 'Cook, Lucy', 'Laydon, Daniel J', 'Hlela, Carol', 'Verdonck, Kristien', 'Alvarez, Carolina', 'Gotuzzo, Eduardo', 'Clark, Daniel', 'Farre, Lourdes', 'Bittencourt, Achilea', 'Asquith, Becca', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Gillet NA', 'Cook L', 'Laydon DJ', 'Hlela C', 'Verdonck K', 'Alvarez C', 'Gotuzzo E', 'Clark D', 'Farre L', 'Bittencourt A', 'Asquith B', 'Taylor GP', 'Bangham CR']","['Section of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom. n.gillet@ulg.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130404,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Coinfection', 'Dermatitis/*complications', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/physiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Strongyloides stercoralis', 'Strongyloidiasis/*complications/parasitology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', '*Viral Load']",PMC3617147,2013/04/18 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1003263 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-12-02814 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(4):e1003263. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003263.

In this study, we define a mechanism for this by showing that MYC/MAX complexes suppress ERK activity by transcriptionally regulating two members of the dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family. DUSPs function by binding and then inactivating ERK1,2 by dephosphorylating residues required for catalytic activity. MYC/MAX complexes achieve this by binding the promoters of DUSP2 and DUSP7, leading to their transcriptional activation, resulting in the attenuation of ERK activity. In the absence of MYC, ectopic DUSP2,7 expression severely delays differentiation, while loss of DUSP2,7 ectopically activates ERK, resulting in loss of pluripotency. These findings elucidate a novel regulatory role for MYC in PSC maintenance involving the stimulation of phosphatases that directly inhibit the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, it provides a mechanism for how leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/STAT3 signaling reaches across to the MAPK/ERK pathway through MYC and MAX to sustain pluripotency.","['Chappell, James', 'Sun, Yuhua', 'Singh, Amar', 'Dalton, Stephen']","['Chappell J', 'Sun Y', 'Singh A', 'Dalton S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Paul D.

Although the physiologic functions of this receptor remain undefined, it has been strongly implicated recently in immune and inflammatory responses. Lack of availability of receptor-selective high-affinity antagonists has impeded progress in studies of this and most of the eight nucleotide-activated P2Y receptors. A series of molecules recently were identified by Gauthier et al. (Gauthier et al., 2011) that exhibited antagonist activity at the P2Y14-R. We synthesized one of these molecules, a 4,7-disubstituted 2-naphthoic acid derivative (PPTN), and studied its pharmacological properties in detail. The concentration-effect curve of UDP-glucose for promoting inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in C6 glioma cells stably expressing the P2Y14-R was shifted to the right in a concentration-dependent manner by PPTN. Schild analyses revealed that PPTN-mediated inhibition followed competitive kinetics, with a KB of 434 pM observed. In contrast, 1 muM PPTN exhibited no agonist or antagonist effect at the P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, or P2Y13 receptors. UDP-glucose-promoted chemotaxis of differentiated HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells was blocked by PPTN with a concentration dependence consistent with the KB determined with recombinant P2Y14-R. In contrast, the chemotactic response evoked by the chemoattractant peptide fMetLeuPhe was unaffected by PPTN. UDP-glucose-promoted chemotaxis of freshly isolated human neutrophils also was blocked by PPTN. In summary, this work establishes PPTN as a highly selective high-affinity antagonist of the P2Y14-R that is useful for interrogating the action of this receptor in physiologic systems.","['Barrett, Matthew O', 'Sesma, Juliana I', 'Ball, Christopher B', 'Jayasekara, P Suresh', 'Jacobson, Kenneth A', 'Lazarowski, Eduardo R', 'Harden, T Kendall']","['Barrett MO', 'Sesma JI', 'Ball CB', 'Jayasekara PS', 'Jacobson KA', 'Lazarowski ER', 'Harden TK']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130416,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemotaxis/*drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Glioma/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists/pharmacology', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*metabolism', 'Uridine Diphosphate Glucose/*metabolism']",PMC3684828,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/09/12 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.113.085654 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.113.085654 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2013 Jul;84(1):41-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.113.085654.

METHODS: We designed 184 PCR amplicons that cover all of the candidate genes. NGS was performed with genomic DNA (gDNA) from a cohort of 10 individuals with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The results were compared with NGS data obtained from sequencing of DNA generated by whole-genome amplification (WGA) of 20 ng template gDNA. Differences between gDNA and WGA samples in variant frequencies were determined for 2 different WGA kits. RESULTS: For gDNA samples, 25 of 26 genes were successfully sequenced with a sensitivity of 5%, which was achieved by a median coverage of 492 reads (range, 308-636 reads) per amplicon. We identified 24 distinct mutations in 11 genes. With WGA samples, we reliably detected all mutations above 5% sensitivity with a median coverage of 506 reads (range, 256-653 reads) per amplicon. With all variants included in the analysis, WGA amplification by the 2 kits tested yielded differences in variant frequencies that ranged from -28.19% to +9.94% [mean (SD) difference, -0.2% (4.08%)] and from -35.03% to +18.67% [mean difference, -0.75% (5.12%)].

High throughput genomic analysis promises better diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic intervention based on improved patient stratification. Relevant preclinical models are urgently required to advance drug development in this area. The collaborating oncogenes, HOXA9 and MEIS1, are frequently co-overexpressed in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), and a conditional transplantation mouse model was developed that demonstrated oncogene dependency and expression levels comparable to CN-AML patients. Integration of gene signatures obtained from the mouse model and a cohort of CN-AML patients using statistically significant connectivity map analysis identified Entinostat as a drug with the potential to alter the leukemic condition toward the normal state. Ex vivo treatment of leukemic cells, but not age-matched normal bone marrow controls, with Entinostat validated the gene signature and resulted in reduced viability in liquid culture, impaired colony formation, and loss of the leukemia initiating cell. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with Entinostat resulted in prolonged survival of leukemic mice.

Somatic dysregulation of NSD1 and EZH2 have been associated with tumorigenesis. NSD1, as a fusion transcript with NUP98, plays a key role in leukemogenesis, particularly childhood acute myeloid leukemia. EZH2 is a major proto-oncogene and mono- and biallelic activating and inactivating somatic mutations occur as early events in the development of tumors, particularly poor prognosis hematopoietic malignancies. Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. NSD1 mutations that cause Sotos syndrome are loss-of-function, primarily truncating mutations or missense mutations at key residues in functional domains. EZH2 mutations that cause Weaver syndrome are primarily missense variants and the rare truncating mutations reported to date are in the last exon, suggesting that simple haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be generating the overgrowth phenotype although the exact mechanism has not yet been determined. Many additional questions about the molecular and clinical features of NSD1 and EZH2 remain unanswered. However, studies are underway to address these and, as more cases are ascertained and technology improves, it is hoped that these will, in time, be answered.","['Tatton-Brown, Katrina', 'Rahman, Nazneen']","['Tatton-Brown K', 'Rahman N']","[""Institute of Cancer Research, St George's University of London and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK. kate.tatton-brown@icr.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130416,United States,Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet,"American journal of medical genetics.

The possibility of gene silencing using siRNA gives hope for effective treatment of numerous diseases. The aim of this work was to investigate in vitro biophysical properties of dendriplexes formed by siRNA and cationic phosphorus dendrimers of 3rd and 4th generation. First, using the ethidium bromide intercalation method, it was examined whether dendrimers have an ability to form complexes with siRNA. Next, the characterisation of dendriplexes formed at different molar ratios was carried out using biophysical methods. The effects of zeta potential, size and changes of siRNA conformation on the complexation with dendrimers were examined. It was found that both phosphorus dendrimers interacted with siRNA. The zeta potential values of dendriplexes ranged from negative to positive and the hydrodynamic diameter depended on the number of dendrimer molecules in the complex. Furthermore, using circular dichroism spectroscopy it was found that cationic phosphorus dendrimers changed only slightly the shape of siRNA CD spectra, thus they did not induce significant changes in the nucleic acid secondary structure during complex formation.","['Ferenc, Malgorzata', 'Pedziwiatr-Werbicka, Elzbieta', 'Nowak, Katarzyna E', 'Klajnert, Barbara', 'Majoral, Jean-Pierre', 'Bryszewska, Maria']","['Ferenc M', 'Pedziwiatr-Werbicka E', 'Nowak KE', 'Klajnert B', 'Majoral JP', 'Bryszewska M']","['Department of General Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, 141/143 Pomorska St., Lodz 90-236, Poland. malgosiaferenc@wp.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130415,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,"['Biophysics/methods', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Dendrimers/*chemistry', 'Ethidium/chemistry', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/therapy', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Phosphorus/*chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC6270478,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules18044451 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules18044451 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2013 Apr 15;18(4):4451-66. doi: 10.3390/molecules18044451.,4,,"['0 (Dendrimers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have identified the oncogene cyclin-dependent protein kinase 6 (CDK6) as a direct target of miR-29b in lung cancer. We hypothesized that in vivo restoration of miR-29b and thus targeting of genes important to tumor initiation and progression may represent an option for lung cancer treatment. We developed a cationic lipoplexes (LPs)-based carrier that efficiently delivered miR-29b both in vitro and in vivo. LPs containing miR-29b (LP-miR-29b) efficiently delivered miR-29b to NSCLC A549 cells, reduced the expression of key targets CDK6, DNMT3B, and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1), as well as cell growth and clonogenicity of A549 cells. In addition, the IC50 for cisplatin in the miR-29b-treated cells was effectively reduced. In a xenograft murine model, LPs efficiently accumulated at tumor sites. Systemic delivery of LP-miR-29b increased the tumor miR-29b expression by approximately fivefold, downregulated the tumor mRNA expression of CDK6, DNMT3B, and MCL1 by ~57.4, ~40.5, and ~52.4%, respectively, and significantly inhibited tumor growth by ~60% compared with LP-miR-NC (negative control). Our results demonstrate that cationic LPs represent an efficient delivery system that holds great potential in the development of miRNA-based therapeutics for lung cancer treatment.Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e84; doi:10.1038/mtna.2013.14; published online 16 April 2013.","['Wu, Yun', 'Crawford, Melissa', 'Mao, Yicheng', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Davis, Ian C', 'Elton, Terry S', 'Lee, L James', 'Nana-Sinkam, Serge P']","['Wu Y', 'Crawford M', 'Mao Y', 'Lee RJ', 'Davis IC', 'Elton TS', 'Lee LJ', 'Nana-Sinkam SP']","['Center for Affordable Nanoengineering of Polymeric Biomedical Devices, 1012 Smith Lab, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130416,United States,Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,Molecular therapy.

Analysis of transposon common insertion sites identified 7 genes activated by transposon insertions. Overexpression of these genes in mouse CLL was confirmed by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, the main known function of 4 of 7 genes (Nfkb1, Tab2, Map3K14, and Nfkbid) is participation in or activation of the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathway. In addition, activation of the NF-kB is 1 of main functions of Akt2, also identified in the screen.

Never before have so many potential targets been studied. Yet most have not advanced beyond the phase 1 and, occasionally, phase 2 studies. The few ongoing phase 3 studies seem unlikely to have more than a marginal benefit, if at all. Thus, it is not surprising that in past few decades almost no new drugs for AML have received regulatory approval. In 2000, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration based on promising phase 2 data in relapsed older adults with AML. GO held promise as a new agent that also could be efficacious in newly diagnosed AML with acceptable toxicity. Several phase 3 studies were designed to test GO in this setting. The results of a randomized study by the Southwest Oncology Group led in 2010 to the voluntary withdrawal of this agent when improved efficacy could not be demonstrated and toxicity appeared excessive. Since then, 4 randomized studies have been completed that, in aggregate, strongly support the efficacy of this agent in newly diagnosed AML with acceptable toxicity. There is a very plausible explanation for this discrepancy, making a compelling case for reapproval of GO in AML.","['Rowe, Jacob M', 'Lowenberg, Bob']","['Rowe JM', 'Lowenberg B']","['Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. rowe@jimmy.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20130416,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male']",,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57276-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-490482 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 13;121(24):4838-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-490482.

Relapses of ALL in children were more often in HR-ALL but also in very few non-HR-ALL. Thus current clinical study of ALL has focused on improving the outcome of a few subtypes of HR-ALL. Infants with ALL have a particularly high risk of treatment failure. Infant ALL Interfant-99 study found that MLL rearrangement, age younger than 6 months, poor response to a prednisone prophase and high WBC count were strong independent predictive factors for poor prognosis in infants with ALL. Treatments with hybrid protocol, including both lymphoid- and myeloid-directed treatment elements, also contain HD-MTX and high dose Ara-C(HD-Ara-C), will further improve the outcome for infant ALL. Children Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL (Ph+ALL) was associated with a high relapse rate when treated with chemotherapy alone. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) AALL0031 trial showed that the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs) imatinib to intensive chemotherapy resulted in 3-year EFS more than historical control treated with chemotherapy alone. These findings create a new paradigm for integrating molecularly targeted agents with intensified chemotherapy. Children with T-ALL have had a worse outcome than with the precursor B-cell ALL previously. With more intensified chemotherapy , outcomes for children T-ALL were improved, approaching those for the precursor B-cell ALL. Recently, COG decided to treat children with T-cell ALL with separate protocols different from those for the precursor B-cell ALL, and the protocols of BFM for children with T-ALL have been the same as those of the precursor B-cell ALL. Early precursor T-cell ALL, a novel subtype of T-cell ALL, was identified by gene expression profiling, flow cytometry, and single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses. ETP-ALL, identified in 13% of T-cell ALL cases, is characterized by a distinctive immunophenotype (CD1a and CD8 negativity, with weak expression of CD5 and co-expression of stem cell or myeloid markers). A retrospective analysis suggested that ETP-ALL had a poor prognosis. The advent of high-resolution genome-wide analyses has provided new insights into leukemogenesis and identified many novel subtypes of leukemia. Ph-like ALL (BCR-ABL1-like ALL) patients lack a previously identified chromosomal rearrangement, but exhibit a gene-expression profile highly similar to that of Ph+ALL, and often have deletion/mutation of IKZF1, CRLF2 rearrangments and JAK1/2sequence mutations which are also common in Ph+ALL. The prognosis of Ph-like ALL is poor. Development of new agents targeted to leukemogenic pathways will promise to further improve the outcome of children ALL.","['Lu, Xin-tian']",['Lu XT'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China. dr.luxt@gmail.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

METHODS: During the period of 2008 to 2010,123 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in our hospital were enrolled in this study, of whom, 70 patients were with cirrhosis and 53 without cirrhosis, The autoantibody profile was tested for each patient by using immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Of the 123 PBC patients with liver cirrhosis, 49% were positive with serum ANA positive; 47%, 51%, 54%, 31% and 49% were positive with serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-mitochondrial antibodies-M2 (AMA-M2), anti-promyelocytic leukemia (anti-PML), anti-sp100 antibodies (anti-sp100), anti-Ro-52 antibody (anti-52KD), respectively. By contrast, of the PBC patients without liver cirrhosis, only 38%, 37%, 51%, 60%, 30% and 51% were positive with serum ANA, AMA, AMA-M2, anti-PML, anti-sp100 and anti-52KD, respectively.There was the statistical difference between the two groups. In addition, it was also found that the anti-gp210 antibody positive group had a higher Mayo risk score,lower serum albumin and severe cholestasis and impaired liver function when compared with anti-gp210 antibody negative patients. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that serum AMA is helpful for early diagnosis of PBC, and in particular, serum ANA positivity can help make a diagnosis for the AMA-negative patients. These indicate that anti-gp210 antibodies appear in the late course of PBC.Anti-gp210 positive PBC patients have more severe cholestasis and liver dysfunction.","['Liu, Hong-hong', 'Fu, Jun-liang', 'Xu, Jun', 'Luo, Sheng-qiang', 'Liu, Zhen-wen', 'Wang, Fu-sheng']","['Liu HH', 'Fu JL', 'Xu J', 'Luo SQ', 'Liu ZW', 'Wang FS']","['Medical School of Chinese PLA, Bejing 100853, China; Chinese PLA 302 Hospital, Bejing 100039, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

We set out to evaluate whether subcellular localization of NPM1, as detected by IHC, is stable during disease course in AML, and whether cytoplasmic expression of NPM1 (NPMc+) can be used to differentiate recovery versus residual disease in formalin-fixed and hydrochloric acid/EDTA decalcified specimens. IHC against NPM1 was performed on bone marrow biopsies of 31 patients with AML at initial diagnosis and on 40 follow-up biopsies. Immunostaining patterns of NPM1, defined as NPMc+, NPMc-, and indeterminate, were correlated with morphology, ancillary tests, and clinical follow-up information. Of the 20 (64.5%) cases with NPMc- at initial diagnosis, none of the 27 follow-up biopsies showed NPMc+, regardless of disease status. Of the 11 cases (35.5%) with NPMc+ at initial diagnosis, all of the 3 biopsies with persistent/relapsed disease, and none of the 7 benign biopsies had NPMc+ at follow-up. For the 3 biopsies with indeterminate follow-up pathologic diagnoses of recovery versus residual disease, all were NPMc- at follow-up, which was consistent with remission and was supported by clinical follow-up.

Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and CRP were measured pre-, mid- and post- each chemotherapy cycle. Patients were randomized to receive either therapy with deferasirox vs. no deferasirox therapy once serum ferritin increased to >500 mug/l. The trial was stopped prematurely due to excess gastrointestinal (GI) and infectious toxicity demonstrable in the deferasirox arm, after 10 patients had been randomized to deferasirox and 6 patients to the control arm. Overall, deferasirox was poorly tolerated, with median maximum tolerated dose only 13.8 mg/kg/d and no patient able to tolerate doses >20 mg/kg/d. Median duration of deferasirox therapy was only 72 d (range 19-130 d), with 9/10 patients requiring unplanned dose interruptions and 4/10 patients unable to continue the drug predominantly due to GI effects. Although all 3 treatment-related deaths occurred in the deferasirox arm (P = 0.25), median overall survival was similar between treatment arms. Use of deferasirox to prevent iatrogenic iron overload in AML patients undertaking induction/consolidation is poorly tolerated and appears to be associated with excess GI and infectious toxicity.","['Kennedy, Glen A', 'Morris, Kirk L', 'Subramonpillai, Elango', 'Curley, Cameron', 'Butler, Jason', 'Durrant, Simon']","['Kennedy GA', 'Morris KL', 'Subramonpillai E', 'Curley C', 'Butler J', 'Durrant S']","[""Department of Haematology, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Butterfield St, Herston, QLD 4029, Australia. glen_kennedy@health.qld.gov.au""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20130417,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzoates/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Deferasirox', 'Early Termination of Clinical Trials', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Humans', '*Iatrogenic Disease', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Iron Chelating Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Iron Overload/*complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/08/02 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12319 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Jun;161(6):794-801. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12319.

Current treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia are based on both patient-related parameters such as age and performance status as well as the intrinsic characteristics of particular disease subtypes. Subtyping of acute myeloid leukemia requires an integration of information from the patient's clinical history (such as any prior preleukemic myeloid neoplasm or cytotoxic potentially leukemogenic therapy), the leukemia morphology, cytogenetic findings, and the mutation status of particular genes (NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA). In recent years, a barrage of information has become available regarding gene mutations that occur in acute myeloid leukemia and their influence on prognosis. Future therapies for acute myeloid leukemia will increasingly rely on the genetic signatures of individual leukemias and will adjust therapy to the predicted disease aggressiveness as well as employ therapies targeted against particular deregulated genetic pathways. This article reviews current standards for diagnosing and classifying acute myeloid leukemia according to the 2008 WHO Classification. Data that have subsequently accumulated regarding newly characterized gene mutations are also presented. It is anticipated that future leukemia classifications will employ a combination of karyotypic features and the gene mutation pattern to stratify patients to increasingly tailored treatment plans.","['Hasserjian, R P']",['Hasserjian RP'],"['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA. rhasserjian@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12081 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2013 Jun;35(3):358-66. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12081.,3,,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,

Therefore, many laboratories search for panels that would provide sufficient immunophenotyping information and meet economical requirements. At the Flow Cytometry Laboratory, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada, we apply two 10-color tubes of surface markers for diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). These tubes contain most of the mandatory B- and T-cell markers according to European Leukemia Net (www.leukemia-net.org) recommendations. The B-cell-oriented panel includes the following antibodies: Kappa-FITC/lambda-PE/CD19-ECD/CD38-PC5.5/CD20-PC7/CD34-APC/CD23 APC-AF700/CD10 APC-AF750/CD5-PB/CD45-KO. A different combination is applied to detect cytoplasmic Ig light chain expression and aberrant immunophenotype of plasma cells. The T-cell panel allows enumeration of various T- and NK-cell subsets: CD57-FITC/CD11c-PE/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5.5/CD2-PC7/CD56-APC/CD7-APC-AF700/CD4-APC-AF750 /CD5-PB/CD45-KO. The reported overall incidence of B-cell chronic LPDs presenting with more than one aberrant population is approximately 5%. Multicolor analysis facilitates the detection of multiple aberrant populations in the same sample because expression of multiple antigens can be studied simultaneously in each defined population. Examples of LPDs with multiple aberrant populations are presented.","['Porwit, A']",['Porwit A'],"['Department of Pathobiology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Toronto, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada. anna.porwit@uhn.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hematologic Diseases/diagnosis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12080 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2013 Jun;35(3):275-82. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12080.,3,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,,,,,['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,

Met-express successfully identified a group of key enzyme-coding genes and metabolites in lung, leukemia, and breast cancers. Literature reviews suggest that approximately 33-53% of the predicted genes are either known or suggested anti-cancer drug targets, while 22% of the predicted metabolites are known or high-potential drug compounds in therapeutic use. Furthermore, experimental validations prove that 90% of the selected genes and 70% of metabolites demonstrate the significant anti-cancer phenotypes in cancer cells, implying that they may play important roles in cancer metabolism.

An important biomedical application of these systems is characterization of tumor cell heterogeneity. In this work, we used a robust microfluidic platform to explore the heterogeneity of enzyme activity in single cells treated with a chemotherapeutic drug. Using chemical cytometry, we measured peptide degradation in the U937 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line in the presence and absence of the aminopeptidase inhibitor Tosedostat (CHR-2797). The analysis of 99 untreated cells revealed rapid and consistent degradation of the peptide reporter within 20 min of loading. Results from drug-treated cells showed inhibited, but ongoing degradation of the reporter. Because the device operates at an average sustained throughput of 37 +/- 7 cells/h, we were able to sample cells over the course of this time-dependent degradation. In data from 498 individual drug-treated cells, we found a linear dependence of degradation rate on amount of substrate loaded superimposed upon substantial heterogeneity in peptide processing in response to inhibitor treatment. Importantly, these data demonstrated the potential of microfluidic systems to sample biologically relevant analytes and time-dependent processes in large numbers of single cells.","['Kovarik, Michelle L', 'Shah, Pavak K', 'Armistead, Paul M', 'Allbritton, Nancy L']","['Kovarik ML', 'Shah PK', 'Armistead PM', 'Allbritton NL']","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130502,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*methods', 'Peptides/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects']",PMC3671928,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac4002029 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2013 May 21;85(10):4991-7. doi: 10.1021/ac4002029.

Besides their low frequency, functional analysis of basophils is hindered by a short life span, inefficient ex vivo differentiation protocols, and lack of suitable cell models. A method to produce large quantities of basophils in vitro would facilitate basophil research and constitute a sought-after tool for diagnostic and drug testing purposes. METHODS: A method is described to massively expand bone marrow-derived basophils in vitro. Myeloid progenitors are conditionally immortalized using Hoxb8 in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and outgrowing cell lines selected for their potential to differentiate into basophils upon shutdown of Hoxb8 expression. RESULTS: IL-3-dependent, conditional Hoxb8-immortalized progenitor cell lines can be expanded and maintained in culture for prolonged periods. Upon shutdown of Hoxb8 expression, near-unlimited numbers of mature functional basophils can be differentiated in vitro within six days. The cells are end-differentiated and short-lived and express basophil-specific surface markers and proteases. Upon IgE- as well as C5a-mediated activation, differentiated basophils release granule enzymes and histamine and secrete Th2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-13) and leukotriene C4. IL-3-deprivation induces apoptosis correlating with upregulation of the BH3-only proteins BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and downregulation of proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 kinase (PIM-1). CONCLUSION: A novel method is presented to generate quantitative amounts of mouse basophils in vitro, which moreover allows genetic manipulation of conditionally immortalized progenitors. This approach may represent a useful alternative method to isolating primary basophils.","['Gurzeler, U', 'Rabachini, T', 'Dahinden, C A', 'Salmanidis, M', 'Brumatti, G', 'Ekert, P G', 'Echeverry, N', 'Bachmann, D', 'Simon, H U', 'Kaufmann, T']","['Gurzeler U', 'Rabachini T', 'Dahinden CA', 'Salmanidis M', 'Brumatti G', 'Ekert PG', 'Echeverry N', 'Bachmann D', 'Simon HU', 'Kaufmann T']","['Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Basophils/*cytology/*physiology', 'Cell Degranulation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene C4/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Th2 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Tryptases/genetics/metabolism']",,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/all.12140 [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 2013;68(5):604-13. doi: 10.1111/all.12140.,5,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Mcpt8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (mast cell protease 11, mouse)']",,,,,,['Allergy. 2013;68(5):553-4.

The patient had no sick contacts and no significant past medical history other than ALL. The patient had been given all recommended childhood vaccinations. Arthrocentesis and needle biopsy of the femoral neck were not diagnostic for malignancy and revealed only mild hip joint inflammation, leading to a diagnosis of osteomyelitis. The organism in the original blood culture was identified as Haemophilus influenzae type b, beta-lactamase negative. Review of the patient's medical records showed a history of complete immunization to Haemophilus influenzae type b. An immunologic evaluation was made to determine if the patient retained immunity from his other vaccinations. Pathogen-specific antibody testing revealed detectable antibodies to polio but not measles, mumps, rubella, varicella-zoster virus, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, or hepatitis B. This loss of immunologic memory appears to be a rarely described side effect of ALL chemotherapy. There is currently no protocol to evaluate the immunologic memory of patients who underwent chemotherapy for ALL or to revaccinate them after their treatment.

This study aimed to assess the current routine practices in APL and the clinico-pathologic features of APL. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 48 Korean patients (25 men, 23 women; median age, 51 (20-80) years) diagnosed with APL in 5 university hospitals between March 2007 and February 2012. RESULTS: The WBC count at diagnosis and platelet count varied from 0.4 to 81.0 (median 2.0)x10(9)/L and 2.7 to 124.0 (median 54.5)x10(9)/L, respectively.

The utility of reassessing the disease karyotype at relapse is unclear. The main goals of this study were to identify prognostic factors for AML relapse and to determine the prognostic utility of karyotypic change between diagnosis and relapse as a variable for predicting response to salvage therapy for relapsed AML. METHODS: This retrospective study included 58 patients with relapsed AML treated at the Yonsei University College of Medicine between 2005 and 2010. Karyotypes at both diagnosis and relapse were available for 45 patients (77%). A change in karyotype at relapse was observed in 17 of 45 cases (37%), and no change was noted in 28 of 45 cases (62%). RESULTS: Karyotypic changes between diagnosis and relapse were associated with the response rate (RR) to salvage therapy (P=0.016). Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in the group with karyotypic changes between diagnosis and relapse were significantly different from those with no karyotypic changes (P=0.004 and P=0.010, respectively). We applied multiple multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify independent prognostic factors for overall response (OR), OS, and EFS. A change in karyotype between diagnosis and relapse was significantly associated with OS (P=0.023; RR=2.655) and EFS (P=0.033; RR=2.831). CONCLUSION: Karyotypic changes between the diagnosis and relapse of AML could be used to predict outcomes and tailor clinical and biological therapeutic strategies for relapsed AML patients.","['Kim, Yundeok', 'Jang, Jieun', 'Hyun, Shin Yong', 'Hwang, Dohyu', 'Kim, Soo Jeong', 'Kim, Jin Seok', 'Cheong, Jun-Won', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Kim Y', 'Jang J', 'Hyun SY', 'Hwang D', 'Kim SJ', 'Kim JS', 'Cheong JW', 'Min YH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130325,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,PMC3624999,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/04/17 06:01,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2013.48.1.24 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2013 Mar;48(1):24-30. doi: 10.5045/br.2013.48.1.24.

A detailed understanding of the involvement of SOCS genes in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is critical to effectively manage GVHD, yet their expression patterns among recipients remain largely unexplored. METHODS: Expression levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in patients with acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD), in a severity-dependent manner, after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A total of 71 recipients with AML (N=40), ALL (N=12), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; N=10), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; N=2), severe aplastic anemia (SAA; N=5), or others (N=2), who received allogeneic HSCT from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings or unrelated donors between 2009 and 2011, were included in the present study. RESULTS: Overall, the expression levels of SOCS1 decreased in recipients with grade II to IV aGVHD and cGVHD when compared to normal donors and non-GVHD recipients. Interestingly, the expressions of SOCS1 decreased significantly more in cGVHD than in aGVHD recipients (P=0.0091). In contrast, SOCS3 expressions were similarly reduced in all the recipients. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that SOCS1 and SOCS3 are differentially expressed in recipients following allogeneic HSCT, suggesting a prognostic correlation between SOCS genes and the development of GVHD. This result provides a new platform to study GVHD immunobiology and potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for GVHD.","['Lee, Tae Hyang', 'Lee, Ji Yoon', 'Park, Sohye', 'Shin, Seung Hwan', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Park, Chong-Won', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Lee TH', 'Lee JY', 'Park S', 'Shin SH', 'Yahng SA', 'Yoon JH', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Park CW', 'Kim HJ']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130325,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,PMC3625005,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/04/17 06:01,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2013.48.1.16 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2013 Mar;48(1):16-23. doi: 10.5045/br.2013.48.1.16.

The host microenvironment plays important roles in cancer progression, but how niches might control cancer cell dormancy is little understood. Here we show that osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular matrix molecule secreted by osteoblasts, can function to anchor leukemic blasts in anatomic locations supporting tumor dormancy. We demonstrate that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells specifically adhere to OPN in vitro and secrete OPN when localized to the endosteal niche in vivo. Using intravital microscopy to perform imaging studies of the calvarial bone marrow (BM) of xenografted mice, we show that OPN is highly expressed adjacent to dormant tumor cells within the marrow. Inhibition of the OPN-signaling axis significantly increases the leukemic cell Ki-67 proliferative index and leads to a twofold increase in tumor burden in treated mice. Moreover, using cell-cycle-dependent Ara-C chemotherapy to produce minimal residual disease (MRD) in leukemic mice, we show that OPN neutralization synergizes with Ara-C to reduce detectable BM MRD. Taken together, these data suggest that ALL interacts with extracellular OPN within the malignant BM, and that this interaction induces cell cycle exit in leukemic blasts, protecting them from cytotoxic chemotherapy.","['Boyerinas, Benjamin', 'Zafrir, Maya', 'Yesilkanal, Ali E', 'Price, Trevor T', 'Hyjek, Elizabeth M', 'Sipkins, Dorothy A']","['Boyerinas B', 'Zafrir M', 'Yesilkanal AE', 'Price TT', 'Hyjek EM', 'Sipkins DA']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130415,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism/pathology', 'Osteopontin/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC3682335,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57274-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-12-475483 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 13;121(24):4821-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-12-475483.

In particular, the risk of developing therapy-related acute leukemia (TRAL) and cardiotoxicity have led to treatment restrictions for MTZ; however, the precise risk for these severe complications is still unclear. Here we review current data on TRAL incidence, research strategies aimed at individual risk stratification, and provide recommendations for hematologic monitoring. A recent meta-analysis indicates a TRAL risk of approximately 0.81%, more than 10-fold higher than in previously reported meta-analyses (0.07%). There also appear to be considerable differences among countries, with recent TRAL risk estimates from Italy as high as 0.93%, compared to the 0.25%-0.41% risk reported from Germany and France. Whereas methodologic differences may partly account for some of these differences, high regional variability may point to exogenous factors such as heterogeneous treatment protocols and cotreatments. In addition, genetic risk factors (MTZ metabolism, DNA repair) might contribute to the individual risk profile. The case of potentially curable MTZ-induced secondary leukemia highlights the need for close hematologic monitoring during and after therapy. Intensive collaboration between neurologists and hematologists will likely provide benefits both for research efforts aimed at unraveling TRAL pathogenesis and for clinical practice with improved identification and monitoring of patients at higher risk of MTZ-induced TRAL. This is of particular importance, since treatment alternatives, especially in secondary progressive MS, are sparse.","['Chan, Andrew', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Chan A', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Neurology, St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.

Accumulating evidence suggests that AID is also prooncogenic, inducing cancer-promoting mutations or chromosome rearrangements. In this context, we find that AID is expressed in >40% of primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases, consistent with other reports. Using a combination of human B lymphoid leukemia cells and mouse models, we now show that AID expression can be harnessed for antileukemic effect, after inhibition of the RAD51 homologous recombination (HR) factor with 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2-2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). As a proof of principle, we show that DIDS treatment inhibits repair of AID-initiated DNA breaks, induces apoptosis, and promotes cytotoxicity preferentially in AID-expressing human CLL. This reveals a novel antineoplastic role of AID that can be triggered by inhibition of HR, suggesting a potential new paradigm to treat AID-expressing tumors. Given the growing list of tumor types with aberrant AID expression, this novel therapeutic approach has potential to impact a significant patient population.","['Lamont, Kristin R', 'Hasham, Muneer G', 'Donghia, Nina M', 'Branca, Jane', 'Chavaree, Margaret', 'Chase, Betsy', 'Breggia, Anne', 'Hedlund, Jacquelyn', 'Emery, Ivette', 'Cavallo, Francesca', 'Jasin, Maria', 'Ruter, Jens', 'Mills, Kevin D']","['Lamont KR', 'Hasham MG', 'Donghia NM', 'Branca J', 'Chavaree M', 'Chase B', 'Breggia A', 'Hedlund J', 'Emery I', 'Cavallo F', 'Jasin M', 'Ruter J', 'Mills KD']","['The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"[""4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/pathology/radiation effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homologous Recombination/drug effects/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Rad51 Recombinase/metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing']",PMC3646491,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20121258 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20121258 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2013 May 6;210(5):1021-33. doi: 10.1084/jem.20121258.,5,,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', ""Q1O6DSW23R (4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 130 survivors of childhood ALL diagnosed between 1970 and 2002 with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing at a median of 22.5 years after diagnosis. Morphometric analyses including whole-brain segmentation were performed using a validated automated procedure; 130 healthy adults served as controls. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, ALL survivors showed significantly smaller volumes of cortical gray matter, cerebral white matter, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, thalamus, and estimated intracranial volume. Effect sizes ranged from small to medium. The strongest effect was found for the caudate, which on average was 5.2% smaller in ALL survivors. Caudate volumes were also smaller when controlling for intracranial volume, suggesting a specific effect. Neither age at diagnosis nor treatment variables such as radiation therapy or drug dose had a major impact on neuroanatomic volumes. Neuropsychological assessment revealed reduced processing speed, executive function, and verbal learning/memory in survivors compared with controls but no difference in estimated general intellectual ability. In ALL survivors, but not in controls, neuropsychological test results correlated with volumes of cortical gray matter, caudate, and thalamus as well as intracranial volume. CONCLUSION: Structural MRI of long-term survivors of childhood ALL demonstrated smaller volumes of multiple brain structures compared with healthy controls. Because of possible selection biases, these results must be interpreted with caution.

Immunofluorescence microscopy combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (immuno-FISH), the method that would typically be used in such a study, is limited by spatial resolution and requires prior assumptions for selecting genes to probe. Our new technique, immuno-TRAP, overcomes these limitations. Using promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) as a model, we used immuno-TRAP to determine if specific genes localize within molecular dimensions with these bodies. Although we confirmed a TP53 gene-PML NB association, immuno-TRAP allowed us to uncover novel locus-PML NB associations, including the ABCA7 and TFF1 loci and, most surprisingly, the PML locus itself. These associations were cell type specific and reflected the cell's physiological state.

In this manuscript, we investigated 23 APL patients treated with 10 mg arsenic trioxide daily, detected the arsenic metabolites in urine samples collected on the 0, 10th, and 20th day of arsenic treatment. At the same time, liver function and blood routine examination were also investigated in these APL patients. We found that, urinary monomethylated arsenic proportion (MMA%) increased, but dimethylated arsenic proportion (DMA%), the first methylation ratio (FMR) and the secondary methylation ratio (SMR) decreased with consecutive administration of arsenic trioxide. After adjustment for age impact, no statistical difference was observed in urinary arsenic concentrations and arsenic methylation capacity between male and female at the same treatment time point. During arsenic trioxide treatment of APL, transient elevation of serum aminotransferases was found in the blood samples, which indicated that liver injury occurred and probably reversible. Leukocytosis developed in 5 of the 23 patients with the administration of arsenic trioxide. No statistical difference was observed in the other blood routine examination parameters. These results demonstrated that the capacity of arsenic methylation decreased and transient liver injury occurred during arsenic trioxide treatment of APL, which indicated that the side effects of clinical arsenic treatment can not be ignored.","['Wang, Huihui', 'Xi, Shuhua', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Yang, Ying', 'Zheng, Quanmei', 'Wang, Fei', 'Xu, Yuanyuan', 'Wang, Yi', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Sun, Guifan']","['Wang H', 'Xi S', 'Liu Z', 'Yang Y', 'Zheng Q', 'Wang F', 'Xu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zheng Y', 'Sun G']","[""Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110831,United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/urine', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects/urine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/urine', 'Leukocytosis/drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*adverse effects/urine', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/08/08 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/tox.20717 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2013 May;28(5):267-75. doi: 10.1002/tox.20717.

Following transfection with plasmids expressing GINS2 siRNA, the apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were determined by fl ow cytometry. The results revealed that K562 chronic myelocytic leukemia cells and NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells were arrested in the G2 phase. Western blot assay indicated that the expression of cyclin A, cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 was decreased, and cyclin B1 was localized in the cytoplasm after GINS2 knockdown as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining. The expression of the apoptosis-related protein Bcl-2 was decreased but that of Bax was increased in the cells transfected with GINS2 siRNA.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Plastrum testudinis (PT) on differentiation, proliferation, gamma-globin gene expression and HbF synthesis in human erythroid cells. For this purpose, we used the K562 human leukemia cell line and human erythroid progenitor cells from normal donors and patients with beta-thalassemia cultured using the two-phase liquid culture system. The effects of PT on erythroid differentiation, proliferation, gamma-globin gene expression and HbF synthesis, as well as the involvement of epigenetic histone modifications within the gamma-globin gene promoter via activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, were assessed by benzidine staining, trypan-blue dye exclusion, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). PT promoted the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, and increased gamma-globin mRNA accumulation and HbF synthesis without inhibiting cell proliferation in K562 cells and human erythroid progenitors. PT exerted no effect on alpha- and beta-globin gene expression. In human erythroid cells, PT activated the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and enhanced the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, the phosphorylation of histone H3 within the Ggamma- and Agamma-globin gene promoter regions, gamma-globin mRNA accumulation and HbF synthesis. These effects were suppressed by pre-treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. Epigenetic histone modifications within gamma-globin gene promoter regions, via activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, are important for the induction of gamma-globin gene expression in human erythroid cells by PT. PT may be a novel potential therapeutic agent for beta-hemoglobinopathies, including beta-thalassemia and SCA.","['Qian, Xinhua', 'Chen, Jia', 'Zhao, Danhua', 'Guo, Lishan', 'Qian, Xinlai']","['Qian X', 'Chen J', 'Zhao D', 'Guo L', 'Qian X']","[""Department of Neonatology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China. xinhua49@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130408,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'gamma-Globins/*genetics']",,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2013.1338 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2013 Jun;31(6):1418-28. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2013.1338.

However, the molecular mechanism that modulates VEGF expression and secretion in leukemia cells has not yet to be elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of the signal pathway in modulating the expression of VEGF in HL-60 cells. Specific siRNAs targeting VEGF were transfected into HL-60 cells and the VEGF expression was measured with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot assay. The cell proliferation of HL-60 cells was detected by the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was detected by the RT-PCR assay and flow cytometry assay for CD11b. The upstream transcription factors that were related to VEGF expression such as P53, SP-1, c-jun, VHL, cox-2, c-myc and stat3 were detected by RT-PCR assay. In addition, the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to reveal the role of c-myc by binding the target gene VEGF. The results demonstrated the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha-related signaling pathway, not the same as in solid tumors, might not play a key role in modulating VEGF expression. c-myc contributes to the modulation of VEGF expression by targeting the promoter of VEGF, which was indicated by the ChIP assay. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that VEGF plays an important role in the differentiation and proliferation of HL-60 cells; c-myc-dependent downregulation of VEGF induced by ATRA contributes to the differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Song, Guanhua', 'Li, Yanmei', 'Zhang, Zhiyong', 'Ren, Xia', 'Li, Hongjiang', 'Zhang, Wen', 'Wei, Ruoying', 'Pan, Sufei', 'Shi, Lulu', 'Bi, Kehong', 'Jiang, Guosheng']","['Song G', 'Li Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Ren X', 'Li H', 'Zhang W', 'Wei R', 'Pan S', 'Shi L', 'Bi K', 'Jiang G']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory for Modern Medicine and Technology of Shandong Province, Shandong, Jinan, Shandong 250062, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130409,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2395 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Jun;29(6):2378-84. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2395.

Here we showed that chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) is highly expressed in patients with MM, plasma cell leukemia cells and increased in patient cells resistant to bortezomib treatment. CRM1 expression also correlates with increased lytic bone and shorter survival. Importantly, CRM1 knockdown inhibits MM cell viability. Novel, oral, irreversible selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) targeting CRM1 (KPT-185, KPT-330) induce cytotoxicity against MM cells (ED50<200 nM), alone and cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or osteoclasts (OC). SINEs trigger nuclear accumulation of multiple CRM1 cargo tumor suppressor proteins followed by growth arrest and apoptosis in MM cells. They further block c-myc, Mcl-1, and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity. SINEs induce proteasome-dependent CRM1 protein degradation; concurrently, they upregulate CRM1, p53-targeted, apoptosis-related, anti-inflammatory and stress-related gene transcripts in MM cells. In SCID mice with diffuse human MM bone lesions, SINEs show strong anti-MM activity, inhibit MM-induced bone lysis and prolong survival. Moreover, SINEs directly impair osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption via blockade of RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1, with minimal impact on osteoblasts and BMSCs. These results support clinical development of SINE CRM1 antagonists to improve patient outcome in MM.","['Tai, Y-T', 'Landesman, Y', 'Acharya, C', 'Calle, Y', 'Zhong, M Y', 'Cea, M', 'Tannenbaum, D', 'Cagnetta, A', 'Reagan, M', 'Munshi, A A', 'Senapedis, W', 'Saint-Martin, J R', 'Kashyap, T', 'Shacham, S', 'Kauffman, M', 'Gu, Y', 'Wu, L', 'Ghobrial, I', 'Zhan, F', 'Kung, A L', 'Schey, S A', 'Richardson, P', 'Munshi, N C', 'Anderson, K C']","['Tai YT', 'Landesman Y', 'Acharya C', 'Calle Y', 'Zhong MY', 'Cea M', 'Tannenbaum D', 'Cagnetta A', 'Reagan M', 'Munshi AA', 'Senapedis W', 'Saint-Martin JR', 'Kashyap T', 'Shacham S', 'Kauffman M', 'Gu Y', 'Wu L', 'Ghobrial I', 'Zhan F', 'Kung AL', 'Schey SA', 'Richardson P', 'Munshi NC', 'Anderson KC']","['LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc, Natick, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London, London, UK."", 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Lurie Family Imaging Center, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130416,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Humans', 'Karyopherins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/*therapy', 'Osteoclasts/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC3883926,2013/04/17 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013115 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jan;28(1):155-65. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.115.

The enhanced apoptosis induced by dasatinib plus CA-4 was accompanied by a greater extent of mitochondrial depolarization, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in HO-8910 cells. Furthermore, elevated expression of Mcl-1 led to a reduced apoptosis induced by dasatinib plus CA-4, highlighting that downregulated Mcl-1 was necessary for the potentiating effect of dasatinib to CA-4-triggered apoptosis. A clear increase in gamma-H2AX expression was observed in the dasatinib+CA-4 group compared with the mono-treatment groups, indicating that dasatinib plus CA-4 may induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) in HO-8910 cells. Moreover, the increased anticancer efficacy of dasatinib combined with CA-4 was further validated in a human HO-8910 ovarian cancer xenograft model in nude mice.

Parental caregiving demands and well-being were evaluated in 161 parents from 47 sites whose child was randomized to receive either a 4-hour (outpatient) or 24-hour (inpatient) methotrexate infusion during consolidation treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A majority of patients randomized to the 4-hour infusion (66.3%) received the infusion as an inpatient. The most frequently reported reasons for this were lack of an adequate outpatient facility (53.6%) and physician preference (25.0%). There were no differences between caregiving demand and well-being total scores by either randomized or actual infusion location with one exception: well-being scale fatigue scores were significantly greater (P=0.001) for parents whose child received the outpatient infusion. Mean total well-being scores for both the 24-hour arm (micro=42.6; SD 16.2) and the 4-hour arm (micro=40.6; SD 14.1) were elevated compared to healthy control populations.

In this study, we performed a gain-of-function screen using miRNA mimic library (319 miRNA species) to identify those affecting cell proliferation in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells (A2780). We discovered a number of miRNAs that increased or decreased the cell viability of A2780 cells. Pro-proliferative and anti-proliferative miRNAs include oncogenic miR-372 and miR-373, and tumor suppressive miR-124a, miR-7, miR-192 and miR-193a, respectively. We found that overexpression of miR-124a, miR-192, miR-193a and miR193b inhibited BrdU incorporation in A2780 cells, indicating that these miRNAs affected the cell cycle. Overexpression of miR193a and miR-193b induced an activation of caspase 3/7, and resulted in apoptotic cell death in A2780 cells. A genomewide gene expression analysis with miR-193a-transfected A2780 cells led to identification of ARHGAP19, CCND1, ERBB4, KRAS and MCL1 as potential miR-193a targets. We demonstrated that miR-193a decreased the amount of MCL1 protein by binding 3'UTR of its mRNA. Our study suggests the potential of miRNA screens to discover miRNAs as therapeutic tools to treat ovarian cancer.","['Nakano, Haruo', 'Yamada, Yoji', 'Miyazawa, Tatsuya', 'Yoshida, Tetsuo']","['Nakano H', 'Yamada Y', 'Miyazawa T', 'Yoshida T']","['Biologics Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Machida-shi, Tokyo 194-8533, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130415,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*genetics/*pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Receptor, ErbB-4', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3699598,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.1896 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2013 Jun;42(6):1875-82. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.1896.

Currently, limited data is available on hypomethylating agents in older AML patients in unselected patient populations. METHODS: To compare the effectiveness of azacitidine with conventional therapy, we collected data of 227 consecutive AML patients (>/=60 years) who were treated with azacitidine (N = 26), intensive chemotherapy (N = 90), or BSC (N = 97). RESULTS: Azacitidine-treated patients were older and had more comorbidities, but lower white blood cell- and bone marrow blast counts compared with intensive chemotherapy patients. Complete or partial response was achieved in 42% of azacitidine-treated patients and in 73% of intensive chemotherapy patients (P = 0.005). However, the overall survival (OS) was similar (1-year-OS 57% versus 56%, P = 0.93; 2-year-OS 35% versus 35%, P = 0.92), and remained similar after correction for risk factors in a multivariate analysis. Patients treated with BSC had an inferior OS (1-year- and 2-year-OS 16% and 2%, P < 0.001). Compared to intensive chemotherapy, azacitidine-treated patients spent less days in the hospital (median in first three months 0.5 versus 56, P < 0.001), and needed less red blood cell and platelet transfusions (median per month 2.7 versus 7, P < 0.001 and 0.3 versus 5, P < 0.001) in the first three months. CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine treatment is associated with a comparable OS but higher tolerability in a subgroup of older AML patients compared with intensive chemotherapy.

It was found that the enhanced activities are dependent on the coumarin nucleus. Biological significance of these compounds include anti-bacterial, anti-thrombotic and vasodilatory, anti-mutagenic, lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase inhibition, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and anti-tumourigenic. Our interest in medicinal chemistry of dicoumarol compounds have been developed by keeping in view the importance of coumarins along with its derivatives in medicinal chemistry. All the synthesized compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic and analytical techniques and were screened for antimicrobial and U2OS bone cancer activities. RESULTS: 4-hydroxycoumarin was derivatized by condensing with different aldehydes yielding the dicoumarol and translactonized products. Elemental analyses, ESI(+,-) MS, 1H and 13C{1H}-NMR, infrared spectroscopy and conductance studies were used to characterize the synthesized compounds which revealed the dicoumarol and dichromone structures for the compounds. The compounds were screened against U2OS cancerous cells and pathogenic micro organisms. The compounds with intermolecular H-bonding were found more active revealing a possible relationship among hydrogen bonding, cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activities. CONCLUSION: Coumarin based drugs can be designed for the possible treatment of U2OS leukemia.","['Rehman, Sadia', 'Ikram, Muhammad', 'Baker, Robert J', 'Zubair, Muhammad', 'Azad, Effat', 'Min, Soyoung', 'Riaz, Kashif', 'Mok, Kh', 'Rehman, Saeed-Ur']","['Rehman S', 'Ikram M', 'Baker RJ', 'Zubair M', 'Azad E', 'Min S', 'Riaz K', 'Mok Kh', 'Rehman SU']","['Institute of Chemical Sciences, University of Peshawar 25120, Peshawar, Pakistan. sadia_rehman571@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130415,England,Chem Cent J,Chemistry Central journal,101314213,,,PMC3668295,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/04/17 06:01,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-153X-7-68 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-153X-7-68 [doi]']",epublish,Chem Cent J. 2013 Apr 15;7(1):68. doi: 10.1186/1752-153X-7-68.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of their limited body length the technique seems especially eligible in juvenile patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort consisted of 10 patients, 6 female and 4 male, aged 4 - 22 y with acute lymphoblastic- (ALL) or acute myeloic leukemia (AML). All patients presented with high risk disease features. Body length in treatment position ranged from 110-180 cm. Two Gy single dose was applied BID to a total dose of 12 Gy. Dose volume constraint for the PTV was 95% dose coverage for 95% of the volume. The lungs were spared to a mean dose of [less than or equal to] 10 Gy. Patients were positioned in a vac-loc bag in supine position with a 3-point head mask. RESULTS: Average D95 to the PTV was 11.7 Gy corresponding to a mean coverage of the PTV of 97.5%.

Overexpression of XIAP is common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers and is thought to cause resistance to cancer therapy. Effective treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory AML are limited and survival continues to be poor. Targeting resistance mechanisms is expected to improve results in relapsed as well as front-line settings. AREAS COVERED: Role of XIAP in apoptosis pathways, structure of AEG 35156, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy and review of clinical trials in AML. EXPERT OPINION: AEG 35156 in combination with standard chemotherapy was generally very well-tolerated and had shown some evidence of anti-leukemic activity in AML. The target knock down was transient and has not always correlated with response. Future studies may be done with variations in dose scheduling and with more emphasis on comprehensive pharmacodynamic studies simultaneously analyzing other inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and various XIAP regulators. Use of small molecule mimetics of second mitochondria derived activator of caspases (Smac) simultaneously targeting other IAPs appears to be an attractive option.","['Katragadda, Lakshmikanth', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Katragadda L', 'Carter BZ', 'Borthakur G']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*metabolism']",,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2013.789498 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2013 May;22(5):663-70. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2013.789498.,5,,"['0 (AEG 35156)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)']",,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSP90, and more recently HSP70, have emerged as possible therapeutic targets in human malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: The authors investigated the effects of the HSP70 inhibitor VER-155008 tested alone or in combination with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) on proliferation, viability, constitutive cytokine release and intracellular HSP levels of primary human AML cells. RESULTS: VER-155008 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cytokine-dependent AML cell proliferation both in suspension cultures and in a colony formation assay, and the drug also had a proapoptotic effect. HSP70 and HSP90 inhibition had additive antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. VER-155008 caused a strong inhibition of the constitutive AML cell release of several growth factors/regulators of hematopoiesis (i.e., TNF-alpha, VEGF, IL-3, IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist), but had relatively weak effects on the constitutive chemokine release. HSP70 inhibition did not induce any compensatory increase of other HSPs. CONCLUSION: HSP70 inhibition has antileukemic effects when tested alone, and the combination of HSP70 and HSP90 inhibition seems to have additive antileukemic effects for primary human AML cells in vitro.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Nepstad, Ina', 'Sulen, Andre', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Hatfield, Kimberley Joanne', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Nepstad I', 'Sulen A', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Bruserud O']","['University of Bergen, Department of Clinical Science, Division for Hematology, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Purine Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/17 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2013.791280 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2013 May;22(5):551-63. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2013.791280.,5,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (VER 155008)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed murine CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and an immunocompetent mouse model of B-ALL that recapitulates the disease at genetic, cellular, and pathologic levels. Mouse T cells transduced with an all-murine CD3zeta/CD28-based CAR that is equivalent to the one being used in our clinical trials, eradicate B-ALL in mice and mediate long-term B cell aplasias. In this model, we find that increasing conditioning chemotherapy increases tumor eradication, B cell aplasia, and CAR-modified T cell persistence. Quantification of recipient B lineage cells allowed us to estimate an in vivo effector to endogenous target ratio for B cell aplasia maintenance. In mice exhibiting a dramatic B cell reduction we identified a small population of progenitor B cells in the bone marrow that may serve as a reservoir for long-term CAR-modified T cell stimulation. Lastly, we determine that infusion of CD8+ CAR-modified T cells alone is sufficient to maintain long-term B cell eradication. The mouse model we report here should prove valuable for investigating CAR-based and other therapies for adult B-ALL.","['Davila, Marco L', 'Kloss, Christopher C', 'Gunset, Gertrude', 'Sadelain, Michel']","['Davila ML', 'Kloss CC', 'Gunset G', 'Sadelain M']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130409,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'CD28 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC3621858,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2012/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0061338 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-00357 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 9;8(4):e61338. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061338.

We report here that in the NSG xenotransplantation assay, the large majority of mononucleated cells from patients with AML fail to establish a reproducible myeloid engraftment despite high donor chimerism. Instead, donor-derived cells mainly consist of polyclonal disease-unrelated expanded co-transplanted human T lymphocytes that induce xenogeneic graft versus host disease and mask the engraftment of human AML in mice. Engraftment of mainly myeloid cell types can be enforced by the prevention of T cell expansion through the depletion of lymphocytes from the graft prior transplantation.","['von Bonin, Malte', 'Wermke, Martin', 'Cosgun, Kadriye Nehir', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Wagemaker, Gerard', 'Waskow, Claudia']","['von Bonin M', 'Wermke M', 'Cosgun KN', 'Thiede C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Wagemaker G', 'Waskow C']","['Regeneration in Hematopoiesis, Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden - CRTD, DFG Research Center and Cluster of Excellence, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130409,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC3621959,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060680 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-35738 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 9;8(4):e60680. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060680.

Using a rho degrees cell model, we show that mt-Cbl toxicity is not dependent on mitochondrial DNA damage. We also illustrate that re-targeting Cbl to mitochondria results in a shift in the cell death mechanism from apoptosis to necrosis, and that this behavior is a general feature of mitochondria-targeted Cbl. Despite the change in cell death mechanisms, we show that mt-Cbl is still effective in vivo and has an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to the parent drug. These findings illustrate that mitochondrial rerouting changes the site of action of Cbl and also alters the cell death mechanism drastically without compromising in vivo efficacy. Thus, mitochondrial delivery allows the exploitation of Cbl as a promiscuous mitochondrial protein inhibitor with promising therapeutic potential.","['Mourtada, Rida', 'Fonseca, Sonali B', 'Wisnovsky, Simon P', 'Pereira, Mark P', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Parfitt, Jeremy', 'Larsen, Lesley', 'Smith, Robin A J', 'Murphy, Michael P', 'Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Kelley, Shana O']","['Mourtada R', 'Fonseca SB', 'Wisnovsky SP', 'Pereira MP', 'Wang X', 'Hurren R', 'Parfitt J', 'Larsen L', 'Smith RA', 'Murphy MP', 'Schimmer AD', 'Kelley SO']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130409,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/*chemistry', 'Chlorambucil/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Necrosis/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3621862,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060253 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-00952 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Apr 9;8(4):e60253. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060253.

We focused our analysis on Ikaros (IKZF1) gene deletions in a homogeneous cohort of 410 pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative, B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in Italy into the AIEOP-BFM ALL2000 study. We confirm their reported poor prognostic value, although the associated event-free survival was relatively high (approximately 70%). The difference in the cumulative incidence of relapse between patients positive or not for IKZF1 deletions was not marked: 24.2% (5.9) versus 13.1% (1.8) overall and 23.9% (6.6) versus 16.5% (2.5) in the intermediate-risk subgroup. In line with this, IKZF1 deletions were not an independent prognostic factor for the hazard of relapse. Most IKZF1-deleted cases stratified in the high-risk group relapsed, suggesting that once identified, patients with these deletions require an alternative treatment. In conclusion, the need of and benefit from introducing IKZF1 deletions as an additional stratification marker for patients with Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain questionable.","['Palmi, Chiara', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Longinotti, Giulia', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Carrino, Valentina', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Kronnie, Geertruy Te', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Palmi C', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Longinotti G', 'Silvestri D', 'Carrino V', 'Conter V', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'Kronnie GT', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130412,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate/trends']",PMC3729902,2013/04/16 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.075432 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.075432 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Aug;98(8):1226-31. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.075432.

Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.","['Navrkalova, Veronika', 'Sebejova, Ludmila', 'Zemanova, Jana', 'Kminkova, Jana', 'Kubesova, Blanka', 'Malcikova, Jitka', 'Mraz, Marek', 'Smardova, Jana', 'Pavlova, Sarka', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Potesil, David', 'Nemethova, Veronika', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Trbusek, Martin']","['Navrkalova V', 'Sebejova L', 'Zemanova J', 'Kminkova J', 'Kubesova B', 'Malcikova J', 'Mraz M', 'Smardova J', 'Pavlova S', 'Doubek M', 'Brychtova Y', 'Potesil D', 'Nemethova V', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S', 'Trbusek M']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, CEITEC - Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130412,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/physiology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC3696617,2013/04/16 06:00,2014/07/08 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.081620 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.081620 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Jul;98(7):1124-31. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.081620.

Recently, an ecologic study reported lower risks of some cancers among children living in higher UVR cities and countries. In a large population-based case-control study in California, we tested the hypothesis that childhood cancers may be influenced by UVR. METHODS: Cancers in children ages 0 to 5 years were identified from California Cancer Registry records for 1988 to 2007 and linked to birth certificate data. Controls were sampled from the birth certificates at a ratio of 20:1. Based on birth address, we assigned UVR exposure in units of Watt-hours/m(2) using a geostatistical exposure model developed with data from the National Solar Radiation Database. RESULTS: For cases with UVR exposure of 5,111 Watt-hours/m(2) or above, we estimated a reduction in odds of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.99), hepatoblastoma (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.48-1.00), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50-1.02) adjusting for mother's age, mother's race, and child's year of birth. We also observed a small increase in odds for intracranial/intraspinal embryonal tumors (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that UVR during pregnancy may decrease the odds of some childhood cancers. Future studies should explore additional factors that may be correlated with UVR exposure and possibly include biomarkers of immune function and vitamin D. IMPACT: This study shows protective associations of UVR with some childhood cancers.","['Lombardi, Christina', 'Heck, Julia E', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Ritz, Beate']","['Lombardi C', 'Heck JE', 'Cockburn M', 'Ritz B']","['Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1772, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130412,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adult', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hepatoblastoma/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', '*Solar Energy', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'Young Adult']",PMC3690302,2013/04/16 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-1316 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1316 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2013 Jun;22(6):1118-28. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1316.

A link between obesity and a childhood cancer has been identified: obese children diagnosed with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had a 50% greater risk of relapse than their lean counterparts. l-asparaginase (ASNase) is a first-line therapy for ALL that breaks down asparagine and glutamine, exploiting the fact that ALL cells are more dependent on these amino acids than other cells. In the present study, we investigated whether adipocytes, which produce significant quantities of glutamine, may counteract the effects of ASNase. In children being treated for high-risk ALL, obesity was not associated with altered plasma levels of asparagine or glutamine. However, glutamine synthetase was markedly increased in bone marrow adipocytes after induction chemotherapy. Obesity substantially impaired ASNase efficacy in mice transplanted with syngeneic ALL cells and, like in humans, without affecting plasma asparagine or glutamine levels. In coculture, adipocytes inhibited leukemic cell cytotoxicity induced by ASNase, and this protection was dependent on glutamine secretion. These findings suggest that adipocytes work in conjunction with other cells of the leukemia microenvironment to protect leukemia cells during ASNase treatment.","['Ehsanipour, Ehsan A', 'Sheng, Xia', 'Behan, James W', 'Wang, Xingchao', 'Butturini, Anna', 'Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Mittelman, Steven D']","['Ehsanipour EA', 'Sheng X', 'Behan JW', 'Wang X', 'Butturini A', 'Avramis VI', 'Mittelman SD']","[""Division of Endocrinology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130412,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adipocytes/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Glutamine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Obesity/complications/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC3684066,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-4402 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4402 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 May 15;73(10):2998-3006. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4402.

It updates the monograph published on the same topic in 2008. The main objective of this monograph is to present the statistics according to standard rigorous epidemiological methods and disseminate them to a wide range of readers, including the lay public. Given the deep impact of the 2008 monograph on the general public, in this update we complement descriptive statistics with additional data and commentaries on issues of importance for public health, in order to provide unambiguous criteria on how to interpret the statistics. The study is the result of the collaboration between AIRTUM and AIEOP (Italian Association of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology) with contributions from interested parties, including representatives of parent associations. The monograph is divided into three parts. The first part presents incidence rates, survival probabilities, and time trends, by sex, age, geographical area, and cancer site or type, by means of tables and graphs as in the previous monograph, to facilitate direct comparisons. Four articles summarize and comment the results. The second part uses data from AIRTUM and AIEOP to outline patient management and health care issues; it includes estimates of the number of new cases in the next decade and of young adults living after a paediatric cancer diagnosis. Health organizational aspects of treatment services for paediatric patients, based on the AIEOP database, are also discussed, along with long-term complications in cured patients. The third section describes the changes in mortality trends due to improving therapies and healthcare services, and discusses risk factors and prevention of childhood cancer, late adverse events in cured patients, and other related issues. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data herein presented were provided by AIRTUM population-based cancer registries, covering 47%of the Italian population below age 20 years, in the period 2003-2008. Quality of cancer registration in Italy is elevated, with high proportions of microscopically verified diagnoses (91%in the 0-14 years age group and 96% between 15 and 19 years of age) and a very small proportion of cases collected through death certificate only (0.1%).The proportion of cases in diagnostic groups XI (other malignant epithelial neoplasms) and XII (other and unspecified neoplasms) of the International Classification for Childhood Cancer (ICCC), based on the third revision of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3), were 7.0% in the 0-14 years age group and 26.0%in the 15-19 years age group.The ratio between mortality and incidence was 17.7% in both children and adolescents. Detailed results are presented in 24 fact sheets for the 12 major ICCC-3 diagnostic groups and 10 sub-groups of special interest; the series is completed by a sheet on all malignant tumours and one on all tumours including non-malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system. All sheets include results for three age groups (0-14, 15-19, and 0-19 years) and are followed by two commentaries on incidence in the recent period, one on trends and the other on survival. Incidence rates were age-standardized on the European population and presented per million children. Incidence rates are also presented by age group, sex, and geographical area. Incidence trends were evaluated for two periods, 1988-2008 and 1998-2008, using estimated annual percent changes, and survival estimates were calculated by age and period. Indicators and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are shown in forms of graphics and tables at the end of the monograph and online at http://www.registri-tumori.it. Geographical analyses were conducted rearranging cancer registries into four macroareas (North-West, North-East, Centre, and South and Islands). Age groups were the same used in descriptive studies on children worldwide (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10- 14 years for paediatric tumours and 15-19 years for adolescents). Incidence trend analyses included cancer registries with three or more years of registration in the 5-year period, using Poisson regression models. Observed survival was computed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The estimate of expected cases in the next decade was based on observed incidence rates in the most recent period, extended to the Italian estimated population of children and adolescents in the periods 2011-2015 and 2016-2020. The AIEOP database (Modello 1.01) allowed us to compare the number of patients treated and followed-up in specialized centres with expected cases based on AIRTUM estimates. The AIEOP database also provided information regarding health care migration throughout Italian regions and the number of foreign (immigrated) children treated in Italian AIEOP centres. RESULTS: In the period 2003-2008, 31 cancer registries reported 4,473 incident malignant neoplasms, 2,855 in children and 1,618 in adolescents. Cancer incidence rates were 164 cases per million in children aged 14 years or below and 269 cases per million in patients aged 15-19 years. Limited geographical variations emerged. In children (0-14 years) a significant increase in malignant cancer incidence was observed until 1997 (APC: +3.2%), followed by a plateau (APC: -1.1%not statistically significant).Until the late Nineties, a statistically significant increase was also observed in the incidence of all leukaemias in males (APC: +5.7%), lymphoid leukaemias (APC: +5.6%), representing 80% of all leukaemias, Hodgkin and non- Hodgkin lymphomas (APC: +6.3%). A significant decrease emerged for lymphoid leukaemia starting in 1995 (APC: -1.9%), while no substantial change in cancer incidence rates was observed in the last decade of observation for all malignant neoplasms and lymphomas. In addition, no variation emerged for malignant (according to the most recent classification) central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms, while an annual increase of 1.8% (significant) was observed in the period 1988-2008, when non-malignant tumours were included. Increases in cancer incidence were observed throughout the study period for neuroblastoma (APC: +1.9%) and epithelial tumours or melanoma (APC: +4.1%). In the period 1998-2008, in addition to lymphoid leukaemias, a significant decrease was observed for all malignant neoplasms, lymphomas in girls, CNS tumours (males and females), and renal tumours in girls, while no increases were observed in this age group. In adolescents (15-19 years) between 1988 and 2008, a significant increase in incidence rates was observed (APC: +2.0%) for all malignant neoplasms, all lymphomas (APC: +2.9%; in particular Hodgkin lymphoma, APC: +3.6%), thyroid cancer (APC: +6.1%), and melanoma (APC: +8.1%). Conversely, lymphoid leukaemia is the only neoplasm showing a long-term decrease in adolescents. Recent trends (1998-2008) confirm the long-term increases only for all malignant neoplasms in girls and thyroid cancer (APC: +7.9%, boys and girls), while a decrease in bone tumour incidence emerged in girls, albeit based only on 46 cases. Cancer mortality in children showed a persistent decrease for all neoplasms and even for more frequent cancer sites or types, and mortality rates for cancer were three-fold higher in the early Seventies than in 2008. In addition, five-year survival after cancer diagnosis increased in the last three decades and was still increasing in the period 2003- 2008, reaching 82% in children and 86% in adolescents. In the period 2008-2010, 4,488 children (0-14 years) were treated in one of the AIEOP clinical centres and we estimate, based on the above-presented incidence rates, that they represented 92% of all cancer cases in Italy. However, in adolescents, the proportion of patients treated in AIEOP centres was only 25%. A migration of patients living in the South of Italy to Central and Northern Italy emerged from AIEOP information. The expected number of cancer cases in children aged between 0 and 14 years of age is approximately 7,000 in the period 2016- 2020, while the corresponding figure for adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age is 4,000, with no relevant variation in comparison with the previous five-year period. COMMENTS: The present findings update descriptive cancer epidemiology in children and adolescents in Italy based on data provided by an extensive network of general and specialized population-based cancer registries. Data obtained from cancer registries are supplemented by additional information collected by specialized clinical AIEOP centres and mortality reports collected by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). Incidence rates reported in Italy were slightly higher in comparison to other developed Countries, but relatively consistent between different Italian areas. Our results also showed that the significant increase in cancer incidence observed until the end of Nineties has halted, with the exception solely of thyroid cancer in adolescents. Efficacy of therapeutic protocols has improved constantly since the Seventies, and recent findings confirm this trend in all age groups and, in particular, for rarer tumours and cancer types that have very poor prognosis. Findings derived from cross-analysis with AIEOP data suggest that it is possible to further improve the efficiency of our healthcare system, in particular for adolescents; migration can be reduced with a more rational use of hospitals throughout Italy.",,,,"['eng', 'ita']",['Journal Article'],,Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age of

RT-HCT has been shown to induce stable engraftment with low toxicity, and to produce similar overall and progression-free survival (PFS) when compared to MA-HCT in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. The best results for RT-HCT have been reported for patients with disease that is in remission, indolent and chemosensitive, and with a strong graft-versus-malignancy effect. Chronic graft-versus-host disease seems to correlate with a lower relapse rate and better PFS. RT-HCT is inferior when performed in poor risk or advanced disease, due to high relapse rates. A search for novel strategies that includes the most appropriate conditioning regimens and post-transplant immunomodulation protocols with more intensive anti-malignancy activity but limited toxicity is in progress. This review provides an update on the results of clinical studies of RT-HCT, and discusses possible indications and investigative strategies for improving the clinical outcomes of RT-HCT for the major hematological malignancies.","['Wahid, S Fadilah Abdul']",['Wahid SF'],"['Department of Medicine, Cell Therapy Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC), Jalan Yaacob Latif, Bandar Tun Razak, Cheras, 56000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. sfadilah@ppukm.ukm.edu.my']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130413,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1313-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 May;97(5):581-98. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1313-0.

Emerging evidences suggest that CYP3A5*3 (rs776746 A>G) polymorphism may play a role in the etiology of carcinogenesis and affect an individual's susceptibility to cancer in humans, but individually published studies showed inconclusive results. This meta-analysis aimed to derive a more accurate estimation of the correlation between CYP3A5*3 polymorphism and cancer risk. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China BioMedicine databases was conducted on articles published before January 1, 2013. Seventeen case-control studies were included with a total of 7,458 cancer patients and 7,166 healthy controls. The meta-analysis results showed that CYP3A5*3 polymorphism may increase the risk of cancer, especially in acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, and colorectal cancer. However, no statistically significant associations were found in prostate cancer, liver cancer, and other cancers. Further subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that CYP3A5*3 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of cancer among Asian and Caucasian populations, but not among African populations. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests that CYP3A5*3 polymorphism may play an important role in the development of acute and chronic leukemia and colorectal cancer, especially among Asian and Caucasian populations.","['Wang, Bao-Sheng', 'Liu, Zhen', 'Xu, Wei-Xue', 'Sun, Shao-Long']","['Wang BS', 'Liu Z', 'Xu WX', 'Sun SL']","[""Department of General Surgery, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Sanhao Street No. 36, Heping District, Shenyang, 110004, People's Republic of China. cmu2h_wbs@126.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130413,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Asians/genetics', 'Blacks/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Risk', 'Whites/genetics']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-0783-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2013 Aug;34(4):2357-66. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-0783-2.

It appears clear that ezrin is directly associated with Fas, leading to activation of caspase cascade and cell death. However, the exact role of ezrin in ursolic acid (UA)-induced apoptosis remains unclear. In this study, we show for the first time that UA induces apoptosis in both transformed and primary leukemia cells through dephosphorylation/downregulation of ezrin, association and polarized colocalization of Fas and ezrin, as well as formation of death-inducing signaling complex. These events are dependent on Rho-ROCK1 signaling pathway. Knockdown of ezrin enhanced cell death mediated by UA, whereas overexpression of ezrin attenuated UA-induced apoptosis. Our in vivo study also showed that UA-mediated inhibition of tumor growth of mouse leukemia xenograft model is in association with the dephosphorylation/downregulation of ezrin. Such findings suggest that the cytoskeletal protein ezrin may represent an attractive target for UA-mediated lethality in human leukemia cells.","['Li, G', 'Zhou, T', 'Liu, L', 'Chen, J', 'Zhao, Z', 'Peng, Y', 'Li, P', 'Gao, N']","['Li G', 'Zhou T', 'Liu L', 'Chen J', 'Zhao Z', 'Peng Y', 'Li P', 'Gao N']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, 3rd Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130412,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,PMC3641322,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/04/16 06:01,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/16 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj20137 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.7 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Apr 12;3:e108. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional evaluation of survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with 18 Gy (n = 127) or 24 Gy (n = 138) CRT. Impairment (age-adjusted score >1 standard deviation below expected mean, two-sided exact binomial test) on the Wechsler Memory Scale IV (WMS-IV) was measured. A subset of survivors (n = 85) completed structural and functional neuroimaging. RESULTS: Survivors who received 24 Gy, but not 18 Gy, CRT had impairment in immediate (impairment rate = 33.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.9% to 42.4%; P < .001) and delayed memory (impairment rate = 30.2%, 95% CI = 22.6% to 38.6%; P < .001). The mean score for long-term narrative memory among survivors who received 24 Gy CRT was equivalent to that for individuals older than 69 years. Impaired immediate memory was associated with smaller right (P = .02) and left (P = .008) temporal lobe volumes, and impaired delayed memory was associated with thinner parietal and frontal cortices. Lower hippocampal volumes and increased functional magnetic resonance imaging activation were observed with memory impairment. Reduced cognitive status (Brief Cognitive Status Exam from the WMS-IV) was identified after 24 Gy (18.5%, 95% CI = 12.4% to 26.1%; P < .001), but not 18 Gy (8.7%, 95% CI = 4.4% to 15.0%; P = .11), CRT, suggesting a dose-response effect. Employment rates were equivalent (63.8% for 24 Gy CRT and 63.0% for 18 Gy CRT). CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors who received 24 Gy CRT had reduced cognitive status and memory, with reduced integrity in neuroanatomical regions essential in memory formation, consistent with early onset mild cognitive impairment.","['Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Petersen, Ronald C', 'Santucci, Aimee', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Srivastava, Deokumar', 'Ogg, Robert J', 'Hillenbrand, Claudia M', 'Sabin, Noah', 'Krasin, Matthew J', 'Kun, Larry', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Armstrong GT', 'Reddick WE', 'Petersen RC', 'Santucci A', 'Zhang N', 'Srivastava D', 'Ogg RJ', 'Hillenbrand CM', 'Sabin N', 'Krasin MJ', 'Kun L', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Robison LL', 'Krull KR']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. greg.armstrong@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130412,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Child', 'Cognition/*radiation effects', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dementia/diagnosis/etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frontal Lobe/pathology', 'Functional Neuroimaging', 'Hippocampus/pathology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory/*radiation effects', 'Memory Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Parietal Lobe/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', '*Radiotherapy Dosage', '*Survivors/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3687368,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/08/27 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['djt089 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djt089 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2013 Jun 19;105(12):899-907. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djt089.

SHP2 influences cell survival, proliferation and differentiation by regulating major signaling pathways. Mutations in PTPN11 cause severe diseases like Noonan, LEOPARD syndrome or leukemia. Whereas several of these mutations result in altered enzymatic activity due to impaired auto-inhibition, not all disease patterns can be explained by this mechanism. In this study we analyzed altered binding properties of disease-related SHP2-mutants bearing point mutations within the SH2-domain (T42A, E139D, and R138Q). Mutants were chosen according to SPR assays, which revealed different binding properties of mutated SH2 towards phosphorylated receptor peptides. To analyze global changes in mutant binding properties we applied quantitative mass spectrometry (SILAC). Using an in vitro approach we identified overall more than 1000 protein candidates, which specifically bind to the SH2-domain of SHP2. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment by altering the binding capacity of the SH2-domain. Mutation-dependent, enhanced or reduced exposure of SHP2 to its binding partners could have an impact on the dynamics of signaling networks. Thus, disease-associated mutants of SHP2 should not only be discussed in the context of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting of the SHP2 mutants. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Using quantitative mass spectrometry based proteomics we provided evidence that disease related mutations in SHP2 domains of SHP2 are able to influence SHP2 recruitment to its targets in mutation dependent manner. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment ratios suggesting altered binding properties of the SH2-domain. We demonstrated that mutations within SHP2, which had been attributed to affect the enzymatic activity (i.e. affect the open/close status of SHP2), also differ in respect to binding properties. Our study indicates that SHP2 mutations need to be discussed not only in terms of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting properties of the SHP2 mutants. Discovery of the new binding partners for disease-related SHP2 mutants might provide a fruitful foundation for developing strategies targeting Noonan-associated leukemia.","['Muller, Pia J', 'Rigbolt, Kristoffer T G', 'Paterok, Dirk', 'Piehler, Jacob', 'Vanselow, Jens', 'Lasonder, Edwin', 'Andersen, Jens S', 'Schaper, Fred', 'Sobota, Radoslaw M']","['Muller PJ', 'Rigbolt KT', 'Paterok D', 'Piehler J', 'Vanselow J', 'Lasonder E', 'Andersen JS', 'Schaper F', 'Sobota RM']","['Department of Biochemistry, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Noonan Syndrome/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(13)00186-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2013.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2013 Jun 12;84:132-47. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.04.005.

BACKGROUND: Current chemotherapy may induce LVSD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers prevent LVSD in animal models of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled study, 90 patients with recently diagnosed acute leukemia (n = 36) or patients with malignant hemopathies undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (n = 54) and without LVSD were randomly assigned to a group receiving enalapril and carvedilol (n = 45) or to a control group (n = 45). Echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging studies were performed before and at 6 months after randomization. The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change from baseline in LV ejection fraction (LVEF). RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50 +/- 13 years old, and 43% were women. At 6 months, LVEF did not change in the intervention group but significantly decreased in controls, resulting in a -3.1% absolute difference by echocardiography (p = 0.035) and -3.4% (p = 0.09) in the 59 patients who underwent CMR. The corresponding absolute difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) in LVEF was -6.38% (95% CI: -11.9 to -0.9) in patients with acute leukemia and -1.0% (95% CI: -4.5 to 2.5) in patients undergoing autologous HSCT (p = 0.08 for interaction between treatment effect and disease category). Compared to controls, patients in the intervention group had a lower incidence of the combined event of death or heart failure (6.7% vs. 22%, p = 0.036) and of death, heart failure, or a final LVEF <45% (6.7% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.02).

New drugs and new regimens are currently being developed for the relapsed patients and for those too old or too frail to receive aggressive treatments. Some of these promising compounds will likely be part of the future front-line treatments. Additionally, the increasing knowledge on the molecular features that predict the clinical outcome may soon result in a molecular classification of the disease.

In telomerase-negative cancer cells, TRF1 also plays a critical role in the mechanism called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and is essential for formation of the ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). It was reported that TRF1 can be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, involving in two regulation factors, Fbx4 and RLIM. Here, we reported that beta-TrCP1, a member of the F-box family protein with ubiquitin ligase activity, is a novel TRF1-associating protein. beta-TrCP1 interacts with TRF1 in vivo and in vitro and promotes its ubiquitination. Overexpression of beta-TrCP1 reduces endogenous TRF1 protein levels, while inhibition of beta-TrCP1 by siRNA stabilizes TRF1. Moreover, we found that beta-TrCP1 is essential for regulation of promyelocytic leukemia body recruitment of TRF1 in U2OS cells. These results reveal that beta-TrCP1 is involved in the negative regulation of TRF1 and represents a new pathway for APB formation in telomerase-negative cells.","['Wang, Chong', 'Xiao, Haowen', 'Ma, Jie', 'Zhu, Yuanyuan', 'Yu, Jian', 'Sun, Ling', 'Sun, Hui', 'Liu, Yanfang', 'Jin, Changjiang', 'Huang, He']","['Wang C', 'Xiao H', 'Ma J', 'Zhu Y', 'Yu J', 'Sun L', 'Sun H', 'Liu Y', 'Jin C', 'Huang H']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130410,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'RNA Interference', 'Telomere Homeostasis', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitination', 'beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)00575-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.096 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 May 17;434(4):728-34. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.096.

A potential anticancer agent, ribavirin, targets eIF4E activity in AML patients corresponding to clinical responses. To date, ribavirin is the only direct inhibitor of eIF4E to reach clinical trials. We showed that ribavirin acts as a competitive inhibitor of the methyl 7-guanosine (m(7)G) cap, the natural ligand of eIF4E. Here we examine the conformational changes occurring in human eIF4E upon binding the active metabolite of ribavirin, ribavirin triphosphate (RTP). Our NMR data revealed an unexpected concentration dependence on RTP affinity for eIF4E. We observed NMR spectra characteristic of tight binding at low micromolar concentrations (2-5 muM eIF4E) but much weaker affinity at more typical NMR concentrations (50- ). Comparison of chemical shift perturbation and line broadening suggest that the two eIF4E-RTP complexes differ in the precise positioning of RTP within the cap binding pocket, with the high affinity complex showing more extensive changes to the central beta-sheet and dorsal surface of eIF4E, similar to m(7)G cap. The differences between high and low affinity complexes arise due to concentration dependent aggregation of eIF4E and RTP. Given the intracellular concentrations of eIF4E and RTP and the differential binding toward the W56A eIF4E mutant the high affinity complex is the most physiologically relevant. In summary, these findings demonstrate that RTP binds in the cap-binding site but also suggests new features of this pocket that should be considered in drug design efforts and reveal new insights into ligand eIF4E recognition.","['Volpon, Laurent', 'Osborne, Michael J', 'Zahreddine, Hiba', 'Romeo, Andrea A', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Volpon L', 'Osborne MJ', 'Zahreddine H', 'Romeo AA', 'Borden KL']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Pavilion Marcelle-Coutu, Chemin Polytechnique, Montreal, Qc, Canada H3T 1J4.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130410,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Ribavirin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",PMC3659399,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)00604-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.125 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 May 10;434(3):614-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.125.

It colonizes the skin, and bronchial and intestinal tract of healthy people producing serious opportunistic infections in patients with haematological malignancies, especially in those with acute leukaemia. Since 1960s its presence is being increasingly recognized in this group of patients. The clinical spectrum of S. capitata disseminated infections is very similar to that produced by Candida, being easily misinterpreted. The associated high mortality and low susceptibility to fluconazole and echinocandins of S. capitata require the acknowledgement of this emergent infection so that it can be properly treated. CASE REPORT: We report 5 new cases of S. capitata disseminated infection in patients with advanced haematological malignancies observed in the haematology unit between the years 2004 and 2010, and review the state-of-the-art for diagnosis and treatment of this infection. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, the prophylactic use of or the empirical antifungal treatment with fluconazole and/or echinocandins would not be adequate for oncohaematological patients in those hospitals where S. capitata infection may be highly prevalent.","['Garcia-Ruiz, Juan Carlos', 'Lopez-Soria, Leyre', 'Olazabal, Inigo', 'Amutio, Elena', 'Arrieta-Aguirre, Ines', 'Velasco-Benito, Veronica', 'Ponton, Jose', 'Moragues, Maria-Dolores']","['Garcia-Ruiz JC', 'Lopez-Soria L', 'Olazabal I', 'Amutio E', 'Arrieta-Aguirre I', 'Velasco-Benito V', 'Ponton J', 'Moragues MD']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130411,Spain,Rev Iberoam Micol,Revista iberoamericana de micologia,9425531,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Catheter-Related Infections/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Dipodascus/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Fungemia/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2014/08/06 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1130-1406(13)00026-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.riam.2013.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Iberoam Micol. 2013 Oct-Dec;30(4):248-55. doi: 10.1016/j.riam.2013.02.004.

Abnormal expression of miR-378 has been observed in various types of cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression status of miR-378 and its clinical significance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using real-time quantitative PCR. miR-378 overexpression was identified in 26 of 84 (31%) AML patients. The patients with miR-378 overexpression had lower hemoglobin level than those without miR-378 overexpression (66 versus 78 g/L, respectively, P=0.010). The frequency of miR-378 overexpression in FAB-M2 subtype was higher than other subtypes (44% versus 20%, P=0.032). Moreover, the frequency of miR-378 overexpression was higher in patients with t(8;21) than in others (64% versus 24%, P=0.012). The status of miR-378 expression was not correlated with the mutations of eight genes (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, C/EBPA and U2AF1). The difference in relapse-free survival was observed between patients with and without miR-378 overexpression (P=0.049). These findings suggest that miR-378 up-regulation is a common event and might have an adverse impact on prognosis in AML.","['Qian, Jun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Wei', 'Ma, Ji-chun', 'Qian, Si-xuan', 'Li, Yun', 'Yang, Jing', 'Li, Jian-yong', 'Wang, Cui-zhu', 'Chai, Hai-yan', 'Chen, Xing-xing', 'Deng, Zhao-qun']","['Qian J', 'Lin J', 'Qian W', 'Ma JC', 'Qian SX', 'Li Y', 'Yang J', 'Li JY', 'Wang CZ', 'Chai HY', 'Chen XX', 'Deng ZQ']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/08/02 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(13)00089-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2013.03.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Jul;37(7):765-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2013.03.014.

The recent discovery that epidermal barrier defects caused by an aberrant differentiation process of keratinocytes are comparably important to the well-characterized changes in immune response patterns attributed a crucial role to the keratinocytes. Fibroblasts are able to alter proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, but their role in AD is not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the role of fibroblasts in skin proliferation and differentiation in patients with AD. METHODS: We used human 3-dimensional organotypic skin cultures consisting of atopic fibroblasts and healthy keratinocytes, as well as healthy fibroblasts and atopic keratinocytes, and compared them with their controls. The expression of differentiation markers in these organotypic cultures were analyzed by using immunohistology and quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, the fundamental role of fibroblast-secreted leukemia inhibitory factor was assessed by using small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown cultures. RESULTS: We observed that atopic fibroblasts influence the proliferation of keratinocytes and the terminal differentiation process, resulting in an in vivo-like morphology of AD. Subsequently, healthy fibroblasts were able to restore the structural deficits of the epidermis consisting of atopic keratinocytes. Partially, these effects were due to a reduced expression of the differentiation-associated cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor by atopic fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that fibroblasts and the modulation of fibroblast-derived factors might be new therapeutic targets for the alleviation of AD.","['Berroth, Andreas', 'Kuhnl, Jochen', 'Kurschat, Nina', 'Schwarz, Agatha', 'Stab, Franz', 'Schwarz, Thomas', 'Wenck, Horst', 'Folster-Holst, Regina', 'Neufang, Gitta']","['Berroth A', 'Kuhnl J', 'Kurschat N', 'Schwarz A', 'Stab F', 'Schwarz T', 'Wenck H', 'Folster-Holst R', 'Neufang G']","['Research and Development, Beiersdorf AG, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130411,United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*etiology', 'Epidermis/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tissue Culture Techniques']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/08/02 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(13)00360-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2013.02.029 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2013 Jun;131(6):1547-54. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2013.02.029.

Gene therapy strategies using IL-15 should include a safety mechanism in anticipation of possible adverse effects because IL-15 overexpression has been implicated in autoimmune disorders and may be involved in the pathogenesis of some leukemias. We developed a retroviral vector carrying both IL-15 and the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) suicide gene and characterized its application in the transduction of human T lymphocytes. METHODS: A retroviral vector carrying IL-15 and HSV-TK genes was optimized for the transduction of human T lymphocytes. IL-15 production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thymidine incorporation and cell viability assays were used to assess the efficacy of the HSV-TK suicide gene. Genetically modified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were assayed for survival after withdrawal from exogenous IL-2. The activity and specificity of retrovirally transduced TILs were assessed using tumor coculture assays. RESULTS: Human T cells transduced with the IL-15 HSV-TK vector exhibited thymidine uptake in the absence of exogenous cytokine support and survived in culture for up to 80 d without IL-2. IL-15 HSV-TK-transduced T cells were efficiently killed by ganciclovir at concentrations as low as 0.1 muM. TILs transduced with the IL-15 HSV-TK vector retained specific recognition of HLA-A2+, MART1+ melanomas, even after withdrawal of IL-2. CONCLUSIONS: Human T lymphocytes genetically modified with the IL-15 HSV-TK retroviral vector retained the ability to recognize tumor antigen while gaining the ability to secrete IL-15 and prolong their own survival. IL-15 HSV-TK-transduced T cells expressed HSV-TK and could be efficiently eliminated by ganciclovir.","['Hsu, Cary', 'Abad, John D', 'Morgan, Richard A']","['Hsu C', 'Abad JD', 'Morgan RA']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of General Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90404, USA. caryhsu@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130403,United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-15/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Melanoma/therapy', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/genetics']",PMC3759574,2013/04/16 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-4804(13)00248-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jss.2013.03.054 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 2013 Sep;184(1):282-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2013.03.054.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is often caused by aberrant fusion transcription factors resulting from chromosomal translocations, and the dysregulated genes detected by microarray include both direct and indirect targets of the oncogenic transcription factors. The ChIP-chip technology enables the identification of direct targets of a transcription factor based on its promoter occupancy and cellular context. Using AML1-ETO9a-induced AML as a cancer model and using a combined gene expression and promoter occupancy profiling approach, we recently identified CD45 as a direct down-regulated target of t(8;21) fusion proteins. This finding subsequently led us to discover the enhanced Janus activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, which is negatively regulated by CD45, in t(8;21) AML.

One of the most important and intriguing questions remaining is the effect of the interactions between wounds and the microflora that are present in wounds. In this report, we describe the first study of the effect of treating murine skin wounds with topical bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the main exogenous ligand of Toll-like receptor 4. Our findings demonstrate that LPS treatment strongly affects the wound-healing process by accelerating the resolution of inflammation, increasing macrophage infiltration, enhancing collagen synthesis, and altering the secretion of a number of mediators that are involved in the skin regeneration process. Topical LPS treatment upregulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)] and CC-chemokines (CCL2/MCP-1, CCL7/MCP-3, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, and CCL5/RANTES), but not CXC-chemokines (CXCL2/MIP-2 and CXCL9/MIG). The secretion of growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and fibroblast growth factor 2) at the wound site was also upregulated. Taken together, these results suggest that the topical application of LPS at the wound surface affects the inflammatory process and promotes the wound healing of injured skin.","['Kostarnoy, Alexey V', 'Gancheva, Petya G', 'Logunov, Denis Y', 'Verkhovskaya, Lyudmila V', 'Bobrov, Maxim A', 'Scheblyakov, Dmitry V', 'Tukhvatulin, Amir I', 'Filippova, Natalia E', 'Naroditsky, Boris S', 'Gintsburg, Alexandr L']","['Kostarnoy AV', 'Gancheva PG', 'Logunov DY', 'Verkhovskaya LV', 'Bobrov MA', 'Scheblyakov DV', 'Tukhvatulin AI', 'Filippova NE', 'Naroditsky BS', 'Gintsburg AL']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biotechnology, NF Gamaleya Research Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Moscow, Russia. kostarnoy@yandex.ru']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130412,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Animals', 'Collagen/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Inflammation/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Skin/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Wound Healing/*drug effects/*immunology']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2012.0108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2013 Sep;33(9):514-22. doi: 10.1089/jir.2012.0108.

Published data of this therapeutic approach for bullous pemphigoid are scant and showed significant morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of low-dose oral cyclophosphamide (CFM) (50-100 mg/day) in patients with refractory bullous pemphigoid. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including patients with bullous pemphigoid treated with CFM in the department of Dermatology in the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain. RESULTS: Complete response was observed in 11 (58%) over 19 evaluable patients. Cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/day was enough to achieve clinical remission in eight of these patients. Partial response was observed in four (21%) more patients. Bone marrow suppression appeared in 12 (60%) patients, but treatment discontinuation was only required in three (15%) cases. Gastrointestinal intolerance occurred in one (5%) patient. One patient died during therapy from heart failure (not attributed to CFM) and another patient developed acute myeloid leukaemia 1.5 years after CFM therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, CFM had a marked therapeutic effect in bullous pemphigoid. These results of efficacy are similar to those described in other autoimmune blistering skin diseases.

We compared the diagnostic utility of the CD203c-BAT to that of ASP-IgG levels in determining ASP allergies in children. Eight ASP allergic reactions occurred over 75 ASP treatment courses. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CD203c-BAT were similar to the ASP-IgG levels (0.75 vs. 0.85, 0.82 vs. 0.78 and 0.81 vs. 0.85, respectively). Positive skin prick test results in patients with ASP allergy suggested that ASP-IgE was one of the key players in ASP allergy. A combination of the BAT with the ASP-IgG level had the highest specificity (0.95) and positive predictive value (0.62), which permitted us to identify ASP allergy more effectively.","['Hino, Moeko', 'Shimojo, Naoki', 'Ochiai, Hidemasa', 'Inoue, Yuzaburo', 'Ando, Kumiko', 'Chikaraishi, Koji', 'Ota, Setsuo', 'Okimoto, Yuri', 'Sunami, Shosuke', 'Nakamura, Ryosuke', 'Teshima, Reiko', 'Sato, Yasunori', 'Kohno, Yoichi']","['Hino M', 'Shimojo N', 'Ochiai H', 'Inoue Y', 'Ando K', 'Chikaraishi K', 'Ota S', 'Okimoto Y', 'Sunami S', 'Nakamura R', 'Teshima R', 'Sato Y', 'Kohno Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University , Chiba , Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130515,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/*immunology', 'Basophils/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/blood/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/diagnosis/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Pyrophosphatases/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2013/04/16 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2013/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.794944 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Jan;55(1):92-6. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.794944.

Its role in leukemogenesis is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of miR-142 was analyzed in acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia cells (de novo, cell lines). Data were compared to expression in CD34+ hematopoietic cells. Based on the miR-142 expression, clinical data such as overall survival was analyzed. RESULTS: MiR-142 expression in all leukemia cell lines and 86 % of the de novo samples was higher than in CD34+ cells. This difference could be detected in both, myeloid and lymphoid neoplastic cells. In AML patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk a high miR-142 expression was associated with a better overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-142 expression in acute lymphoblastic as well as myeloid leukemia cells is higher than in CD34+ cells.

METHODS: An analysis was performed in a retrospective cohort of 280 adult patients aged 18 to 60 years with previously untreated acute leukemia who received induction chemotherapy from January 2000 to December 2009 at the Hemocentro de Pernambuco (HEMOPE), Brazil. Hyperglycemia was defined as the finding of at least one fasting glucose measurement > 100 mg/dL observed one week prior to induction therapy until 30 days after. The association between hyperglycemia and complicated infections, mortality and complete remission was evaluated using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests by the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) in the R software package version 2.9.0. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-eight patients (67.1%) presented hyperglycemia at some moment during induction therapy. Eighty-two patients (29.3%) developed complicated infections. Infection-related mortality during the neutropenia period was 20.7% (58 patients). Mortality from other causes during the first 30 days after induction was 2.8%. Hyperglycemia increased the risk of complicated infections (OR 3.97; 95% confidence interval: 2.08 - 7.57; p-value < 0.001) and death (OR 3.55; 95% confidence interval: 1.77-7.12; p-value < 0.001) but did not increase the risk of fungal infections or decrease the probability of achieving complete remission. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an association between the presence of hyperglycemia and the development of complicated infections and death in adult patients during induction therapy for acute leukemia.","['Matias, Carolina do Nascimento', 'Lima, Vladmir', 'Teixeira, Heberton Medeiros', 'Souto, Fernanda Ribeiro', 'Magalhaes, Vera']","['Matias Cdo N', 'Lima V', 'Teixeira HM', 'Souto FR', 'Magalhaes V']","['Universidade Federal de Pernambuco - UFPE, Recife, PE, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,PMC3621634,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/04/13 06:01,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20130013 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2013;35(1):39-43. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20130013.,1,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fever', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Infection', 'Leukemia', 'Mortality', 'Neutropenia']",,,,,,,

Since 1983, stem cell transplantation has been carried out in different institutes of India. But, till then, no transplantation was performed in eastern India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our present study is reporting for the first time stem cell transplantation in eastern India. From August 2000 to June 2011 (with a 3-year gap for up-gradation), we have performed a total of 22 transplants. Thirteen patients (M:F:9:4) with indications of aplastic anemia, thalassaemia, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia underwent allogenic transplant, whereas autologous transplant was performed for nine patients (M:F:2:1) of multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and neuroblastoma. The median age of the patients was 19.6 years, with a range of 5 years 8 months to 52 years. Fourteen patients received myeloablative conditioning regime whereas eight patients received immunosuppressive and less myeloablative protocol. Sources of stem cells in case of allogenic transplant are bone marrow and related or unrelated umbilical cord blood and in case of autologous transplant, these are peripheral blood stem cells or self-bone marrow. Standard prophylactic medication was followed prior to transplants. RESULTS: A disease-free survival of 68.18% and overall survival of 86.3% were seen at the median follow-up period of 4.6 years. Common post-transplant complications were mucositis, infection, venoocclusive disease, graft versus host disease, hemorrhagic cystitis, etc. CONCLUSION: The use of cord blood as a source of stem cells has been proved inferior as compared with the bone marrow stem cell source in cases of thalassaemia in our institute and thus is not recommended for thalassaemia. But, it has been proved to be a very useful and effective stem cell source (both related and unrelated cord blood) in cases of aplastic anemia and other immunological disorders.","['Mukhopadhyay, A', 'Gupta, P', 'Basak, J', 'Chakraborty, A', 'Bhattacharyya, D', 'Mukhopadhyay, S', 'Roy, U K']","['Mukhopadhyay A', 'Gupta P', 'Basak J', 'Chakraborty A', 'Bhattacharyya D', 'Mukhopadhyay S', 'Roy UK']","['Department of Haemato-Oncology, Molecular Biology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,PMC3618641,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/04/13 06:01,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.107078 [doi]', 'IJMPO-33-203 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2012 Oct;33(4):203-9. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.107078.,4,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aplastic anemia', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'cord blood transplantation', 'eastern Indian data', 'stem cell transplantation', 'thalassaemia']",,,,,,,

In addition to mRNAs and microRNAs, there are DNA fragments in EVs. Solexa sequencing indicated the presence of at least 16434 genomic DNA (gDNA) fragments in the EVs from human plasma. Immunofluorescence study showed direct evidence that acridine orange-stained EV DNAs could be transferred into the cells and localize to and inside the nuclear membrane. However, whether the transferred EV DNAs are functional or not is not clear. We found that EV gDNAs could be homologously or heterologously transferred from donor cells to recipient cells, and increase gDNA-coding mRNA, protein expression, and function (e.g. AT1 receptor). An endogenous promoter of the AT1 receptor, NF-kappaB, could be recruited to the transferred DNAs in the nucleus, and increase the transcription of AT1 receptor in the recipient cells. Moreover, the transferred EV gDNAs have pathophysiological significance. BCR/ABL hybrid gene, involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia, could be transferred from K562 EVs to HEK293 cells or neutrophils. Our present study shows that the gDNAs transferred from EVs to cells have physiological significance, not only to increase the gDNA-coding mRNA and protein levels, but also to influence function in recipient cells.","['Cai, Jin', 'Han, Yu', 'Ren, Hongmei', 'Chen, Caiyu', 'He, Duofen', 'Zhou, Lin', 'Eisner, Gilbert M', 'Asico, Laureano D', 'Jose, Pedro A', 'Zeng, Chunyu']","['Cai J', 'Han Y', 'Ren H', 'Chen C', 'He D', 'Zhou L', 'Eisner GM', 'Asico LD', 'Jose PA', 'Zeng C']","['Department of Cardiology, Daping Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400042, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,United States,J Mol Cell Biol,Journal of molecular cell biology,101503669,IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Neutrophils', 'Transport Vesicles/*physiology']",PMC3733418,2013/04/13 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['mjt011 [pii]', '10.1093/jmcb/mjt011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Aug;5(4):227-38. doi: 10.1093/jmcb/mjt011.

We screened human tissue-derived protein macroarrays with antigen-binding fragments derived from 47 consecutive cases of CLL. An autoantigenic target was identified for 12/47 (25.5%) of the cases, with 3 autoantigens being the target of the BCRs from 2 patients each. Recombinantly expressed autoantigens bound specifically to the CLL cells from which the BCR used for the identification of the respective autoantigen was derived. Moreover, binding of the autoantigen to the respective leukemic cells induced a specific activation and proliferation of these cells. In conclusion, autoantigens are frequent targets of CLL-BCRs. Their specific binding to and induction of proliferation in the respective leukemic cells provide the most convincing evidence to date for the long-time hypothesized role of autoantigens in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Zwick, Carsten', 'Fadle, Natalie', 'Regitz, Evi', 'Kemele, Maria', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Buhler, Andreas', 'Pfreundschuh, Michael', 'Preuss, Klaus-Dieter']","['Zwick C', 'Fadle N', 'Regitz E', 'Kemele M', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Buhler A', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Preuss KD']","['Jose-Carreras Center for Immuno- and Gene Therapy, Department Internal Medicine I, Saarland University Medical School, Homburg (Saar), Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Autoantigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism']",,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/08/07 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58412-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-08-447904 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 6;121(23):4708-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-08-447904.

We have previously shown that myofibroblast differentiation is mediated by the activity of serum response factor (SRF), which is tightly controlled by the actin polymerization state. In this study, we investigated the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in modulating myofibroblast phenotype. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts with the microtubule-destabilizing agent, colchicine, resulted in a formation of numerous stress fibers and expression of myofibroblast differentiation marker proteins. These effects of colchicine were independent of Smad signaling but were mediated by Rho signaling and SRF, as they were attenuated by the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632, or by the SRF inhibitor, CCG-1423. TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation was not accompanied by gross changes in the microtubule polymerization state. However, microtubule stabilization by paclitaxel attenuated TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Paclitaxel had no effect on TGF-beta-induced Smad activation and Smad-dependent gene transcription but inhibited actin polymerization, nuclear accumulation of megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 protein, and SRF activation. The microtubule-associated formin, mDIA2, localized to actin stress fibers upon treatment with TGF-beta, and paclitaxel prevented this localization. Treatment with the formin inhibitor, SMI formin homology 2 domain, inhibited stress fiber formation and myofibroblast differentiation induced by TGF-beta, without affecting Smad-phosphorylation or microtubule polymerization. Together, these data suggest that (a) TGF-beta promotes association of mDia2 with actin stress fibers, which further drives stress fiber formation and myofibroblast differentiation, and (b) microtubule polymerization state controls myofibroblast differentiation through the regulation of mDia2 localization.","['Sandbo, Nathan', 'Ngam, Caitlyn', 'Torr, Elizabeth', 'Kregel, Steve', 'Kach, Jacob', 'Dulin, Nickolai']","['Sandbo N', 'Ngam C', 'Torr E', 'Kregel S', 'Kach J', 'Dulin N']","['Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53792, USA. nsandbo@medicine.wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Amides/pharmacology', 'Anilides/pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Formins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Myofibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/physiology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Serum Response Factor/metabolism', 'Smad Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Stress Fibers/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology']",PMC3668708,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/08/07 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45938-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.464461 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 May 31;288(22):15466-73. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.464461.

This syndrome results from mutations in the MEN1 gene, encoding menin. Although menin acts as an oncogenic cofactor for mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion protein-mediated histone H3 lysine 4 methylation, the precise basis for how menin suppresses gene expression and proliferation of pancreatic beta cells remains poorly understood. Here, we show that menin ablation enhances Hedgehog signaling, a proproliferative and oncogenic pathway, in murine pancreatic islets. Menin directly interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), a negative regulator of gene transcription. Menin recruits PRMT5 to the promoter of the Gas1 gene, a crucial factor for binding of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand to its receptor PTCH1 and subsequent activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, increases repressive histone arginine symmetric dimethylation (H4R3m2s), and suppresses Gas1 expression. Notably, MEN1 disease-related menin mutants have reduced binding to PRMT5, and fail to impart the repressive H4R3m2s mark at the Gas1 promoter, resulting in its elevated expression. Pharmacologic inhibition of Hedgehog signaling significantly reduces proliferation of insulinoma cells, and expression of Hedgehog signaling targets including Ptch1, in MEN1 tumors of mice. These findings uncover a novel link between menin and Hedgehog signaling whereby menin/PRMT5 epigenetically suppresses Hedgehog signaling, revealing it as a target for treating MEN1 tumors.","['Gurung, Buddha', 'Feng, Zijie', 'Iwamoto, Daniel V', 'Thiel, Austin', 'Jin, Guanghui', 'Fan, Chen-Min', 'Ng, Jessica M Y', 'Curran, Tom', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['Gurung B', 'Feng Z', 'Iwamoto DV', 'Thiel A', 'Jin G', 'Fan CM', 'Ng JM', 'Curran T', 'Hua X']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Anilides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans/metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smoothened Receptor']",PMC4100916,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-3158 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3158 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Apr 15;73(8):2650-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3158.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a proto-oncogene MLL (11q23.3) is frequently altered. However, rearrangements involving other regions of chromosome 11 have been reported. Therefore, we have characterized the chromosome 11 breakpoints and common deleted and amplified areas in the bone marrow or peripheral blood cells of newly diagnosed patients with AML. Using molecular-cytogenetic methods (multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH), multicolor banding (mBAND), microarrays, and FISH with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes, chromosome 11 abnormalities were delineated in 54 out of 300 (18%) newly diagnosed AML patients. At least 36 different chromosome 11 breakpoints were identified; two were recurrent (11p15.4 in the NUP98 gene and 11q23.3 in the MLL gene), and three were possibly nonrandom: 11p13 (ch11:29.31-31.80 Mb), 11p12 (ch11:36.75-37.49 Mb) and 11q13.2 (68.31-68.52 Mb). One new MLL gene rearrangement is also described. No commonly deleted region of chromosome 11 was identified. However, some regions were affected more often: 11pter-11p15.5 (n = 4; ch11:0-3.52 Mb), 11p14.1-11p13 (n = 4; ch11:28.00-31.00 Mb) and 11p13 (n = 4; ch11:31.00-31.50 Mb). One commonly duplicated (3 copies) region was identified in chromosomal band 11q23.3-11q24 (n = 9; ch11:118.35-125.00 Mb).

Decitabine administered at a dose of 20 mg/m(2) by a 1-h intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days of a 4-week cycle has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in adult patients aged >/=65 years with de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are not candidates for standard induction therapy. Decitabine, compared with treatment choice (cytarabine or supportive care), did not result in a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival (OS) in older patients with AML at the pre-specified primary endpoint of a pivotal phase III trial. However, the improvement in OS was considered by the EMA to be clinically meaningful. After a further year of follow-up, an analysis of the mature survival data demonstrated a statistical significance in median OS in favour of decitabine over treatment choice. Complete remission (CR) rates in the phase III trial were significantly improved with decitabine versus treatment choice. The overall safety profile of decitabine in older patients with AML was generally similar to that of cytarabine, with pyrexia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia being the most commonly reported adverse events.

Apart from the translocation t(11:14), which facilitates constitutive transcription of cyclin D1, additional aberrations are frequently observed in MCL, including a recurrent dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. mTOR, a key component of this pathway, is pivotal for the assembly of mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2. Temsirolimus, an analog of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, is approved for the treatment of relapsed MCL. Response rates, however, are low and response durations are short. We demonstrate that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or blocking of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in conjunction with PI3K by NVP-BEZ235 reduces proliferation of MCL cell lines to a similar extent. However, only NVP-BEZ235 is able to sufficiently inhibit the downstream pathway of mTOR and to mediate cell death through activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Further analysis demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 plays a central role in regulation of MCL survival. While Mcl-1 protein levels remained unchanged after coculture with rapamycin, they were down-regulated in NVP-BEZ235 treated cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Mcl-1 by the BH3-only mimetic obatoclax or down-regulation of constitutive Mcl-1, but not of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, by siRNA facilitated cell death of MCL cells and enhanced NVP-BEZ235's capacity to induce cell death.

We performed a retrospective study of 75 patients with LC and evaluated the patients' age and sex, clinical features and skin lesion distribution according to the type of leukemia, interval between the diagnosis of leukemia and the development of LC, and prognosis. The male to female ratio was 2:1, and the mean age at diagnosis was 37.6 yr. The most common cutaneous lesions were nodules. The most commonly affected site was the extremities in acute myelocytic leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia except for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Compared with previous studies, there was an increasing tendency in the proportion of males and nodular lesions, and LC most often occurred in the extremities. The prognosis of LC was still poor within 1 yr, which was similar to the results of previous studies. These results suggest that there is a difference in the clinical characteristics and predilection sites according to type of leukemia.","['Kang, Yeon Soo', 'Kim, Hei Sung', 'Park, Hyun Jeong', 'Lee, Jun Young', 'Kim, Hyung Ok', 'Cho, Baik Kee', 'Park, Young Min']","['Kang YS', 'Kim HS', 'Park HJ', 'Lee JY', 'Kim HO', 'Cho BK', 'Park YM']","[""Department of Dermatology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130327,Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,IM,"['Adult', 'Extremities/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/*pathology']",PMC3617317,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3346/jkms.2013.28.4.614 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2013 Apr;28(4):614-9. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2013.28.4.614.

AML may emerge de novo, following other hematopoietic malignancies or after cytotoxic therapy for other disorders. Here, we investigated the clonal vs reactive nature of residual maturing bone marrow cells in 59 newly diagnosed adult AML and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) patients as assessed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome-associated cytogenetic alterations and/or the pattern of chromosome X inactivation, in females. In addition, we investigated the potential association between the degree of molecular/genetic involvement of hematopoiesis and coexistence of altered immunophenotypes by flow cytometry. Our results indicate that residual maturing neutrophils, monocytes and nucleated red cell precursors from the great majority of newly diagnosed AML and MPAL cases show a clonal pattern of involvement of residual maturing hematopoietic cells, in association with a greater number of altered immunophenotypes. These findings are consistent with the replacement of normal/reactive hematopoiesis by clonal myelopoiesis and/or erythropoiesis in most newly diagnosed AML and MPAL cases, supporting the notion that in most adults presenting with de novo AML, accumulation of blast cells could occur over a pre-existing clonal hematopoiesis.","['Fernandez, C', 'Santos-Silva, M C', 'Lopez, A', 'Matarraz, S', 'Jara-Acevedo, M', 'Ciudad, J', 'Gutierrez, M L', 'Sanchez, M L', 'Salvador-Osuna, C', 'Berruezo, M J', 'Diaz-Arias, J A', 'Palomo-Hernandez, A M', 'Colado, E', 'Gonzalez, N', 'Gallardo, D', 'Asensio, A', 'Garcia-Sanchez, R', 'Saldana, R', 'Cervero, C', 'Carbone-Baneres, A', 'Gutierrez, O', 'Orfao, A']","['Fernandez C', 'Santos-Silva MC', 'Lopez A', 'Matarraz S', 'Jara-Acevedo M', 'Ciudad J', 'Gutierrez ML', 'Sanchez ML', 'Salvador-Osuna C', 'Berruezo MJ', 'Diaz-Arias JA', 'Palomo-Hernandez AM', 'Colado E', 'Gonzalez N', 'Gallardo D', 'Asensio A', 'Garcia-Sanchez R', 'Saldana R', 'Cervero C', 'Carbone-Baneres A', 'Gutierrez O', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio General de Citometria and Departamento de Medicina, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer and IBSAL; CSIC-USAL), Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130412,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics']",,2013/04/13 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013109 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.109 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Nov;27(11):2149-56. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.109.

METHODS: A clinical association analysis was performed to examine the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously proposed as markers of chemosensitivity to the cetuximab (124 patients) and bevacizumab regimens (100 patients) in mCRC patients. In addition, biological correlations were examined for the candidate SNPs in terms of their regulatory pathway. RESULTS: For cetuximab regimens, patients homozygous for the wild-type alleles (GG) of LIFR rs3729740 exhibited a 1.9 times greater overall response rate (ORR) and 1.4 months longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those homozygous or heterozygous for the mutant allele (GA and AA; P=0.022 and 0.027, respectively). For bevacizumab regimens, patients homozygous for the minor alleles (TT) of ANXA11 rs1049550 exhibited an ORR twice as high as those homozygous or heterozygous for the ancestral allele (CC and CT; P=0.031). Overall response rate gain was achieved up to 10% in patients with wild-type LIFR rs3729740 patients either with wild-type KRAS or skin toxicity (P=0.001) respectively. Specifically in clones treated with cetuximab and bevacizumab regimens, active p-ERK and MMP-9 expressions were significantly reduced in clones expressing wild-type LIFR rs3729740 (P=0.044) and in those expressing minor-type ANXA11 rs1049550 (P=0.007), respectively. CONCLUSION: LIFR rs3729740 and possibly ANXA11 rs1049550 may be useful as biomarkers for predicting whether mCRC patients are sensitive to relevant target regimens, although further validation in large cohorts is needed.","['Kim, J C', 'Ha, Y J', 'Roh, S A', 'Choi, E Y', 'Yoon, Y S', 'Kim, K P', 'Hong, Y S', 'Kim, T W', 'Cho, D H', 'Kim, S Y', 'Kim, Y S']","['Kim JC', 'Ha YJ', 'Roh SA', 'Choi EY', 'Yoon YS', 'Kim KP', 'Hong YS', 'Kim TW', 'Cho DH', 'Kim SY', 'Kim YS']","['Department of Surgery, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. jckim@amc.seoul.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Annexins/*genetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bevacizumab', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cetuximab', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",PMC3658526,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013163 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.163 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 May 14;108(9):1862-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.163.

Contrary to its stimulatory effect in normal B cells, it has been shown that it induces pro-apoptotic effect in leukemic B cells from CLL patients. Little is known regarding the biological function of IL21 in leukemic B cells from progressive and non-progressive CLL patients. In the present study, the proliferative effect of IL21 in combination with TLR9 agonist (CpG) was investigated in B cells isolated from 24 CLL patients and eight normal subjects by radioactive thymidine incorporation assay. B cells were enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by negative selection using magnetic beads (MACS) and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Our results showed that IL21 enhanced the proliferative effects of CpG in both normal and leukemic B cells, though no significant differences were observed between CLL patients and healthy controls. Comparison between different subsets of patients revealed that while the combination of IL21 and CpG significantly inhibited the proliferation of B cells from progressive compared to non-progressive patients (p=0.001), it enhanced proliferation of leukemic B cells from IGHV mutated compared to unmutated patients (p=0.001). The inhibitory effect of IL21 on proliferation of normal and leukemic cells was found to be apoptosis-independent. Our findings suggest differential effects of IL21 in different subsets of CLL patients and suggest its potential therapeutic implication in patients with a more progressive disease.","['Ghalamfarsa, Ghasem', 'Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad', 'Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein', 'Yousefi, Mehdi', 'Tahmasebi, Fathollah', 'Khoshnoodi, Jalal', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Saboor-Yaraghi, Ali Akbar', 'Rabbani, Hodjatallah', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Ghalamfarsa G', 'Jadidi-Niaragh F', 'Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Asgarian-Omran H', 'Yousefi M', 'Tahmasebi F', 'Khoshnoodi J', 'Razavi SM', 'Saboor-Yaraghi AA', 'Rabbani H', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Shokri F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130409,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology']",,2013/04/13 06:00,2014/01/30 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-4666(13)00142-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2013.03.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2013 Jun;62(3):439-45. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2013.03.023.

These two compounds had potency between 200 and 800nM against many of the leukemia cancer cell types. Subsequent experiments explored activity against a transformed AML model that mimics the molecular signatures identified in primary AML patient samples. A lead compound had an IC50 of 760nM against this AML cell line as well as a therapeutic index of 7.7+/-3 between the transformed AML model cell line and non-cancerous human CD34+ blood stem/progenitor cells (UCB).

Immune tolerance induced by CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) with high expression of Foxp3 is an important hypothesis for poor therapy response. Notch1 signaling is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Crosstalk between Notch and Foxp3+Tregs induced immune tolerance is unknown in T-ALL. We studied Foxp3 and Notch1 expression in vivo and in vitro, and analyzed the biological characteristics of T-ALL cell line systematically after Notch inhibition and explored the crosstalk between Notch signaling and Foxp3 expression. METHODS: In vivo, we established T-ALL murine model by Jurkat cells transplantation to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Notch1 and Foxp3 expression was detected. In vitro, we used gamma-secretase inhibitor N-S-phenyl-glycine-t-butyl ester (DAPT) to block Notch1 signaling in Jurkat cells. Notch1, Hes-1 and Foxp3 genes and protein expression were detected by PCR and western blotting, respectively. The proliferation pattern, cell cycle and viability of Jurkat cells after DAPT treatment were studied. Protein expression of Notch1 target genes including NF-kappaB, p-ERK1/2 and STAT1 were determined. RESULTS: We show that engraftment of Jurkat cells in SCID mice occurred in 8 of 10 samples (80%), producing disseminated human neoplastic lymphocytes in PB, bone marrow or infiltrated organs. Notch1 and Foxp3 expression were higher in T-ALL mice than normal mice. In vitro, Jurkat cells expressed Notch1 and more Foxp3 than normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in both mRNA and protein levels. Blocking Notch1 signal by DAPT inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells and induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Foxp3 as well as p-ERK1/2, STAT1 and NF-kappaB expression was down regulated after DAPT treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that regulation of Foxp3 expression does involve Notch signaling, and they may cooperatively regulate T cell proliferation in T-ALL.","['Luo, Xiaodan', 'Tan, Huo', 'Zhou, Yueqiao', 'Xiao, Tiantian', 'Wang, Chunyan', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Luo X', 'Tan H', 'Zhou Y', 'Xiao T', 'Wang C', 'Li Y']","['Department of Oncology & Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College, Guangzhou, 510230, China. tanhuo.2008@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130411,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,PMC3663738,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/04/13 06:01,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-13-34 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-13-34 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2013 Apr 11;13(1):34. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-13-34.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been few reports that have examined the predictive factors for outcome after strictureplasty. This study was undertaken to assess the long-term results and predictive factors for outcome following strictureplasty for jejunoileal Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients who underwent primary strictureplasty for jejunoileal Crohn's disease between 1980 and 1987 were reviewed. RESULTS: Four patients developed an enterocutaneous fistula, of whom two had an intra-abdominal abscess. Two patients died during this study (one from leukaemia and another from small bowel carcinoma) and one patient was lost to follow up. All other patients have been followed for> 10 years. The 5- and 10-year cumulative reoperation rates for recurrence at the previous jejunoileal strictureplasty sites (site-specific recurrence) were 26% and 29%, respectively, after a median follow up of 13.5 years. After 5 years only one patient required surgery for site-specific recurrence. The only factor associated with a high rate of reoperation for site-specific recurrence was youth (<35 years). Gender, duration of symptoms, smoking habits, preoperative steroids therapy, preoperative albumin level, intra-abdominal abscess at laparotomy, number or length of strictureplasties, or previous or synchronous small bowel resection did not affect the reoperation rate. CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a safe and efficacious procedure for jejunoileal Crohn's disease in the long term. Recurrence tends to develop early after strictureplasty, and late recurrence is uncommon. Only youth was a significant risk factor for site-specific recurrence requiring reoperation.","['Yamamoto', 'Keighley']","['Yamamoto', 'Keighley']","['University Department of Surgery, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Colorectal Dis,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,100883611,,,,1999/03/01 00:00,1999/03/01 00:01,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '1999/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1046/j.1463-1318.1999.00031.x [doi]'],ppublish,Colorectal Dis. 1999 Mar;1(2):101-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1463-1318.1999.00031.x.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment options are limited and prophylactic agents are not available. We have previously demonstrated an essential role for CREB-regulating transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) in HTLV-1 transcription. RESULTS: In this study we report on the negative regulatory role of LKB1 tumor suppressor and salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) in the activation of HTLV-1 long terminal repeats (LTR) by the oncoprotein Tax. Activation of LKB1 and SIKs effectively blunted Tax activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, whereas compromising these kinases, but not AMP-dependent protein kinases, augmented Tax function. Activated LKB1 and SIKs associated with Tax and suppressed Tax-induced LTR activation by counteracting CRTCs and CREB. Enforced expression of LKB1 or SIK1 in cells transfected with HTLV-1 molecular clone pX1MT repressed proviral transcription. On the contrary, depletion of LKB1 in pX1MT-transfected cells and in HTLV-1-transformed T cells boosted the expression of Tax. Treatment of HTLV-1 transformed cells with metformin led to LKB1/SIK1 activation, reduction in Tax expression, and inhibition of cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed a new function of LKB1 and SIKs as negative regulators of HTLV-1 transcription. Pharmaceutical activation of LKB1 and SIKs might be considered as a new strategy in anti-HTLV-1 and anti-ATL therapy.","['Tang, Hei-Man Vincent', 'Gao, Wei-Wei', 'Chan, Ching-Ping', 'Siu, Yeung-Tung', 'Wong, Chi-Ming', 'Kok, Kin-Hang', 'Ching, Yick-Pang', 'Takemori, Hiroshi', 'Jin, Dong-Yan']","['Tang HM', 'Gao WW', 'Chan CP', 'Siu YT', 'Wong CM', 'Kok KH', 'Ching YP', 'Takemori H', 'Jin DY']","['Department of Biochemistry, The University of Hong Kong, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130411,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3640950,2013/04/13 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-40 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-40 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Apr 11;10:40. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-40.,,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (salt-inducible kinase-2, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (SIK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (STK11 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.3 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies indicate that a BH3-only protein BIM (BCL-2 Interacting Mediator of cell death) plays a role in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. We show here that BIM is dispensable in apoptosis with paclitaxel treatment using bim(-/-) MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), the bim(-/-) mouse breast tumor model, and shRNA-mediated down-regulation of BIM in human breast cancer cells. In contrast, both bak (-/-) MEFs and human breast cancer cells in which BAK was down-regulated by shRNA were more resistant to paclitaxel. However, paclitaxel sensitivity was not affected in bax(-/-) MEFs or in human breast cancer cells in which BAX was down-regulated, suggesting that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis is BAK-dependent, but BAX-independent. In human breast cancer cells, paclitaxel treatment resulted in MCL-1 degradation which was prevented by a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. A Cdk inhibitor, roscovitine, blocked paclitaxel-induced MCL-1 degradation and apoptosis, suggesting that Cdk activation at mitotic arrest could induce subsequent MCL-1 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. BAK was associated with MCL-1 in untreated cells and became activated in concert with loss of MCL-1 expression and its release from the complex. Our data suggest that BAK is the mediator of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and could be an alternative target for overcoming paclitaxel resistance.","['Miller, Anna V', 'Hicks, Mark A', 'Nakajima, Wataru', 'Richardson, Amanda C', 'Windle, Jolene J', 'Harada, Hisashi']","['Miller AV', 'Hicks MA', 'Nakajima W', 'Richardson AC', 'Windle JJ', 'Harada H']","['Department of Oral and Craniofacial Molecular Biology, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130405,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",PMC3618047,2013/04/12 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060685 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-37714 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60685. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060685.

However, neutropenia and bleeding tendency are relatively contraindicated to surgical intervention. The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations and outcomes of perianal infection in leukemic patients are also rarely discussed. METHOD: The medical records of 1102 adult patients with acute leukemia at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan between 2001 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. RESULT: The prevalence of perianal infection was 6.7% (74 of 1102) in adult patients with acute leukemia. Twenty-three (31%) of the 74 patients had recurrent episodes of perianal infections. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia had higher recurrent rates than acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (p = 0.028). More than half (n = 61, 53%) of the perianal infections were caused by gram-negative bacilli, followed by gram-positive cocci (n = 36, 31%), anaerobes (n = 18, 15%) and Candida (n = 1, 1%) from pus culture. Eighteen patients experienced bacteremia (n = 24) or candidemia (n = 1). Overall 41 (68%) of 60 patients had polymicrobial infection. Escherichia coli (25%) was the most common micro-organism isolated, followed by Enterococcus species (22%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13%), and Bacteroides species (11%). Twenty-five (34%) of 74 patients received surgical intervention. Acute leukemia patients with surgically managed anal fistulas tended to have fewer recurrences (p = 0.067). Four (5%) patients died within 30 days after diagnosis of perianal infection. Univariate analysis of 30-day survival revealed the elderly (>== 65 years) (p = 0.015) and patients with shock (p<0.001) had worse outcome. Multivariate analysis showed septic shock to be the independent predictive factor of 30-day crude mortality of perianal infections (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Perianal infections were common and had high recurrence rate in adult patients with acute leukemia. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage should be considered. Shock independently predicted 30-day crude mortality. Surgical intervention for perianal infection remains challenging in patients with acute leukemia.","['Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Cheng, Aristine', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Sheng, Wang-Huei', 'Liu, Jia-Hau', 'Ko, Bo-Sheng', 'Yao, Ming', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Lin, Hui-Chi', 'Chen, Yee-Chun', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Chang, Shan-Chwen', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Chen CY', 'Cheng A', 'Huang SY', 'Sheng WH', 'Liu JH', 'Ko BS', 'Yao M', 'Chou WC', 'Lin HC', 'Chen YC', 'Tsay W', 'Tang JL', 'Chang SC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130405,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Abscess/*complications/*microbiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/*complications', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mycoses/*complications', 'Rectal Fistula/*complications/*microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC3618431,2013/04/12 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060624 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-00306 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60624. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060624.

Previous case-control studies examining the association between risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and mothers' self-reported folate intake and supplementation have been inconclusive. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a quantitative microbiologic assay to measure newborn folate concentrations in archived dried bloodspots collected at birth from 313 incident ALL cases, 44 incident acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, and 405 matched population-based controls. RESULTS: Overall, we found no difference in hemoglobin-normalized newborn folate concentrations (HbFol, nmol/g) between ALL cases and controls (2.76 vs. 2.77, P = 0.97) or between AML cases and controls (2.93 vs. 2.76, P = 0.32). Null results persisted after stratification by both birth period (1982-94, 1995-98, and 1999-2002) to account for the start of folate fortification of grain products in the United States, and by self-reported maternal prepregnancy supplement use. Similarly, no association was observed for major ALL subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support an association between birth folate concentrations and risk of childhood AML or major ALL subgroups. IMPACT: However, they do not rule out a role for folate through exposures after birth or in early stages of fetal development.","['Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Chun, Danielle S', 'Noonan, Emily J', 'Pfeiffer, Christine M', 'Zhang, Mindy', 'Month, Stacy R', 'Taggart, Denah R', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Chokkalingam AP', 'Chun DS', 'Noonan EJ', 'Pfeiffer CM', 'Zhang M', 'Month SR', 'Taggart DR', 'Wiemels JL', 'Metayer C', 'Buffler PA']","['UC Berkeley School of Public Health, 1995 University Ave, Ste 460, Berkeley CA 94704, USA. anandc@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130410,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors']",PMC3681890,2013/04/12 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-1438 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1438 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2013 Jun;22(6):1088-94. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1438.

Previous studies have suggested the importance of occupation and related exposures in leukaemogenesis. We evaluated possible associations between job title and selected hazardous agents and leukaemia in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. METHODS: The mean follow-up time for 241 465 subjects was 11.20 years (SD 2.42 years). During the follow-up period, 477 incident cases of myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia occurred. Data on 52 occupations considered a priori to be at high risk of developing cancer were collected through standardised questionnaires. Occupational exposures were estimated by linking the reported occupations to a job exposure matrix. Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the association between occupation and related exposures and risk of leukaemia. RESULTS: The risk of lymphoid leukaemia significantly increased for working in chemical laboratories (HR 8.35, 95% CI 1.58 to 44.24), while the risk of myeloid leukaemia increased for working in the shoe or other leather goods industry (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.28 to 5.06). Exposure-specific analyses showed a non-significant increased risk of myeloid leukaemias for exposure to benzene (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.40; HR=1.60, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.69 for the low and high exposure categories, respectively). This association was present both for acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia at high exposure levels. However, numbers were too small to reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a possible role of occupational exposures in the development of both lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia. Exposure to benzene seemed to be associated with both acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia.","['Saberi Hosnijeh, Fatemeh', 'Christopher, Yvette', 'Peeters, Petra', 'Romieu, Isabelle', 'Xun, Wei', 'Riboli, Elio', 'Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Tjonneland, Anne', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Trichopoulou, Antonia', 'Bamia, Christina', 'Orfanos, Philip', 'Oddone, Enrico', 'Lujan-Barroso, Leila', 'Dorronsoro, Miren', 'Navarro, Carmen', 'Barricarte, Aurelio', 'Molina-Montes, Esther', 'Wareham, Nick', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Vermeulen, Roel']","['Saberi Hosnijeh F', 'Christopher Y', 'Peeters P', 'Romieu I', 'Xun W', 'Riboli E', 'Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Tjonneland A', 'Becker N', 'Nieters A', 'Trichopoulou A', 'Bamia C', 'Orfanos P', 'Oddone E', 'Lujan-Barroso L', 'Dorronsoro M', 'Navarro C', 'Barricarte A', 'Molina-Montes E', 'Wareham N', 'Vineis P', 'Vermeulen R']","['Division Environmental Epidemiology, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130410,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupations/*classification', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2012-101135 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2012-101135 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2013 Jul;70(7):464-70. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2012-101135.

However, clinical responses seen in patients treated with the ABL TKI dasatinib despite its much shorter plasma half-life and the apparent rapid restoration of BCR-ABL signaling activity following once-daily dosing suggested acute, potent inhibition of kinase activity may be sufficient to irrevocably commit CML cells to apoptosis. To determine the specific requirements for ABL TKI-induced CML cell death for a panel of clinically important ABL TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib, and DCC-2036), we interrogated response of CML cell lines and primary CML cells following acute drug exposure using intracellular fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunoblot analyses of BCR-ABL signaling, apoptosis measurements, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry of intracellular drug levels, and biochemical TKI dissociation studies. Importantly, significant intracellular TKI stores were detected following drug washout, levels of which tracked with onset of apoptosis and incomplete return of BCR-ABL signaling, particularly pSTAT5, to baseline. Among TKIs tested, ponatinib showed the most robust capacity for apoptotic commitment showing sustained suppression of BCR-ABL signaling even at low intracellular levels following extensive washout, consistent with high-affinity binding and slow dissociation from ABL kinase. Together, our findings suggest commitment of CML cells to apoptosis requires protracted incomplete restoration of BCR-ABL signaling mediated by intracellular retention of TKIs above a quantifiable threshold. These studies refine our understanding of apoptotic commitment in CML cells and highlight parameters important to design of therapeutic kinase inhibitors for CML and other malignancies.","[""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Adrian, Lauren T', 'Zabriskie, Matthew S', 'Mackenzie, Ryan J', 'Latocha, Dorian H', 'Johnson, Kara J', 'You, Huihong', 'Luo, Jenny', 'Riddle, Steven M', 'Marks, Bryan D', 'Vogel, Kurt W', 'Koop, Dennis R', 'Apgar, John', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Druker, Brian J']","[""O'Hare T"", 'Eide CA', 'Agarwal A', 'Adrian LT', 'Zabriskie MS', 'Mackenzie RJ', 'Latocha DH', 'Johnson KJ', 'You H', 'Luo J', 'Riddle SM', 'Marks BD', 'Vogel KW', 'Koop DR', 'Apgar J', 'Tyner JW', 'Deininger MW', 'Druker BJ']","['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

BET proteins are recruited on transcriptionally active chromatin via their two N-terminal bromodomains (BRD), a protein interaction module that specifically recognizes acetylated lysine residues in histones H3 and H4. Inhibition of the BET-histone interaction results in transcriptional downregulation of a number of oncogenes, providing a novel pharmacologic strategy for the treatment of cancer. Here, we present a potent and highly selective dihydroquinazoline-2-one inhibitor, PFI-1, which efficiently blocks the interaction of BET BRDs with acetylated histone tails. Cocrystal structures showed that PFI-1 acts as an acetyl-lysine (Kac) mimetic inhibitor efficiently occupying the Kac binding site in BRD4 and BRD2. PFI-1 has antiproliferative effects on leukemic cell lines and efficiently abrogates their clonogenic growth. Exposure of sensitive cell lines with PFI-1 results in G1 cell-cycle arrest, downregulation of MYC expression, as well as induction of apoptosis and induces differentiation of primary leukemic blasts. Intriguingly, cells exposed to PFI-1 showed significant downregulation of Aurora B kinase, thus attenuating phosphorylation of the Aurora substrate H3S10, providing an alternative strategy for the specific inhibition of this well-established oncology target.","['Picaud, Sarah', 'Da Costa, David', 'Thanasopoulou, Angeliki', 'Filippakopoulos, Panagis', 'Fish, Paul V', 'Philpott, Martin', 'Fedorov, Oleg', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Bunnage, Mark E', 'Owen, Dafydd R', 'Bradner, James E', 'Taniere, Philippe', ""O'Sullivan, Brendan"", 'Muller, Susanne', 'Schwaller, Juerg', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Knapp, Stefan']","['Picaud S', 'Da Costa D', 'Thanasopoulou A', 'Filippakopoulos P', 'Fish PV', 'Philpott M', 'Fedorov O', 'Brennan P', 'Bunnage ME', 'Owen DR', 'Bradner JE', 'Taniere P', ""O'Sullivan B"", 'Muller S', 'Schwaller J', 'Stankovic T', 'Knapp S']","['Structural Genomics Consortium and Target Discovery Institute, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130410,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3673830,2013/04/12 06:00,2014/01/03 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-3292 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3292 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 1;73(11):3336-46. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3292.

Treatment strategies for AML have improved outcome but despite increased molecular biological information AML is still associated with poor prognosis. Proteomic analysis on the effects of a range of leukemogenic oncogenes showed that the protein transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is expressed at greater levels as a consequence of oncogenic transformation. Further analysis of this observation was performed with 511 AML samples using reverse phase proteomic arrays, demonstrating that TG2 expression was higher at relapse than diagnosis in many cases. In addition elevated TG2 expression correlated with increased expression of numerous adhesion proteins and many apoptosis regulating proteins, two processes related to leukemogenesis. TG2 has previously been linked to drug resistance in cancer and given the negative correlation between TG2 levels and peripheral blasts observed increased TG2 levels may lead to the protection of the leukemic stem cell due to increased adhesion/reduced motility. TG2 may therefore form part of a network of proteins that define poor outcome in AML patients and potentially offer a target to sensitize AML stem cells to drug treatment.","['Pierce, Andrew', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Meyer, Stefan', 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Zhang, Nianxiang', 'Kornblau, Steven']","['Pierce A', 'Whetton AD', 'Meyer S', 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Borthakur G', 'Coombes KR', 'Zhang N', 'Kornblau S']","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Transglutaminases/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4959038,2013/04/12 06:00,2014/03/22 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmic.201200471 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2013 Jul;13(14):2216-2224. doi: 10.1002/pmic.201200471.

CD38 was initially found on thymocytes and T lymphocytes, but today we know that the molecule is found throughout the immune system, although its expression levels vary. Because of this, CD38 was considered an ""activation marker,"" a term still popular in routine flow cytometry. This review summarizes the findings obtained from different approaches, which led to CD38 being re-defined as a multifunctional molecule. CD38 and its homologue CD157 (BST-1), contiguous gene duplicates on human chromosome 4 (4p15), are part of a gene family encoding products that modulate the social life of cells by means of bidirectional signals. Both CD38 and CD157 play dual roles as receptors and ectoenzymes, endowed with complex activities related to signaling and cell homeostasis. The structure-function analysis presented here is intended to give clinical scientists and flow cytometrists a background knowledge of these molecules. The link between CD38/CD157 and human diseases will be explored here in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloma and ovarian carcinoma, although other disease associations are also known. Thus CD38 and CD157 have evolved from simple leukocyte activation markers to multifunctional molecules involved in health and disease.

The commonly accepted assumption is that activated ERK1/2 is key regulators of survival of leukemic cells treated with kinase inhibitors. Hence, paradoxical ERK1/2-activation may trigger resistance in vivo, which yet has to be shown. We therefore sought to establish a flow cytometric assay that enables us to measure paradoxical TKI-induced ERK1/2-activation on a single cell basis in primary CML cells. METHODS: Side-by-side Western blot and intracellular flow cytometry (FCM) after in vitro exposure of cell lines and primary cells to nilotinib were performed. Detailed analysis of pre-analytical factors and the issue of compartmentalization of phosphorylated ERK1/2 by confocal laser scanning microscopy were performed. RESULT: Results were conflicting in that pERK-activation was robustly detected in Western blot assays, but not when cells were analyzed by FCM despite well functioning positive and negative controls. This is in contrast to experiments on other targets such as phospho-CrkL, where also in our hands TKI-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation is trackable by both Western blot and FCM assays. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first report of discordant results in phospho-protein analysis in TKI-treated cells analyzed by Western blot vs. FCM. We speculate that a substance specific interaction interferes with fluorescence dependent methods seeking to track phosphorylated ERK1/2 in TKI-treated cells.","['Schnetzke, Ulf', 'Fischer, Mike', 'Frietsch, Jochen J', 'Finkensieper, Andreas', 'Clement, Joachim H', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'La Rosee, Paul']","['Schnetzke U', 'Fischer M', 'Frietsch JJ', 'Finkensieper A', 'Clement JH', 'Hochhaus A', 'La Rosee P']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130410,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

These proteins are regulated primarily by transcription and stability through pathways that are controlled by Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription, JAK/STAT, transcription factors. The PIM family proteins have been found to be overexpressed in hematological malignancies and solid tumors, and their roles in these tumors were confirmed in mouse tumor models. Furthermore, the PIM family proteins have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, metabolism, cell cycle, and homing and migration, which has led to the postulation of these proteins as interesting targets for anticancer drug discovery. In the present work, we review the importance of PIM kinases in tumor growth and as drug targets.","['Narlik-Grassow, Maja', 'Blanco-Aparicio, Carmen', 'Carnero, Amancio']","['Narlik-Grassow M', 'Blanco-Aparicio C', 'Carnero A']","['Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130410,United States,Med Res Rev,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/med.21284 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Res Rev. 2014 Jan;34(1):136-59. doi: 10.1002/med.21284.

METHODS: Five different databases (Medline, Scopus, CINAHL [Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature], Web of Science, and Cochrane Collaboration) were searched for articles published between January 1966 and May 2012; review articles and the reference lists from the articles that resulted from the search were also evaluated. Population-based cohort studies with data relevant to the determination of cancer risk in patients with SSc were included. All articles that met strict inclusion criteria were analyzed for data on population size, time of followup, and observed-to-expected cancer ratios, also known as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). RESULTS: Six articles met criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled SIR for the incidence of cancer overall was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-1.68), and significant heterogeneity was observed as a consequence of variability in the participants, outcome, study design, and risk of bias among the studies. Men had a significantly higher pooled SIR (1.85 [95% CI 1.49-2.31]) than women (SIR 1.33 [95% CI 1.18-1.49]) (P < 0.01), and stratification for sex eliminated heterogeneity, which indicates that variability among the studies greatly contributed to differences between the sexes. There were no differences between limited cutaneous SSc and diffuse cutaneous SSc (P = 0.77). Significant increases were observed in the risk of cancer of the lung, liver, hematologic system, and bladder, as well as of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. CONCLUSION: SSc is associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly lung, liver, hematologic, and bladder cancers, although absolute risk is relatively low. Men with SSc have a higher risk of developing cancer than women.","['Onishi, Akira', 'Sugiyama, Daisuke', 'Kumagai, Shunichi', 'Morinobu, Akio']","['Onishi A', 'Sugiyama D', 'Kumagai S', 'Morinobu A']","['Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan. aonishi@med.kobe-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",,United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/*epidemiology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2013/09/05 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.37969 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2013 Jul;65(7):1913-21. doi: 10.1002/art.37969.,7,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2013 by the American College of Rheumatology.'],,,,,,,,,

A reanalysis of a large population-based case-control study was carried out. Original data included 1,771 controls and 649 leukaemia cases from 11 Italian areas. To contain recall bias, the analysis was restricted to subjects directly interviewed and with a good quality interview (1,165 controls and 312 cases). Odds ratios (ORs) and their related 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by unconditional polychotomous logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender and occupational and lifestyle exposures. A protective effect of at least one infection (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.97), measles (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.82) and pertussis (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.98) was observed for chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL). The number of infections was strongly inversely associated with the risk of CLL (p = 0.002, test for trend). With regard to the other types of leukaemia, only a protective effect of pertussis was observed for AML (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.32-0.87). Our results pointed out a protective role of childhood infectious diseases on the risk of CLL in adults. Although a specific antioncogenic effect of some infectious disease, especially measles, cannot be ruled out, the observed decrease of risk with increasing number of infections suggests that a more general ""hygiene hypothesis"" could be the most likely explanation of the detected association. The protective role of pertussis remains to be elucidated.","['Parodi, Stefano', 'Crosignani, Paolo', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Nanni, Oriana', 'Ramazzotti, Valerio', 'Rodella, Stefania', 'Costantini, Adele Seniori', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Vindigni, Carla', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Stagnaro, Emanuele']","['Parodi S', 'Crosignani P', 'Miligi L', 'Nanni O', 'Ramazzotti V', 'Rodella S', 'Costantini AS', 'Tumino R', 'Vindigni C', 'Vineis P', 'Stagnaro E']","['Unit of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Clinical Trials, IRCCS AOU San Martino-IST, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130706,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chickenpox/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Measles/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mumps/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Rubella/epidemiology', 'Virus Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Whooping Cough/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28205 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Oct 15;133(8):1892-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28205.

The objective of this study was to determine the HOXA9 gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this purpose, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to measure HOXA9 gene expression in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line and bone marrow mononuclear cells from 54 AML patients and 20 healthy individuals. The data show that HOXA9 mRNA expression was negative in 20 healthy individuals but was positive in HEL cells and in 22 out of 54 (40.74%) AML patients. The complete remission rate (45.45%) of the patients who expressed the gene was significantly lower than that (71.86%) in patients who did not express the gene after chemotherapy. Therefore, it was concluded that HOXA9 gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of AML and played as a worse prognostic factor in AML.","['Li, De-Peng', 'Li, Zhen-Yu', 'Sang, Wei', 'Cheng, Hai', 'Pan, Xiu-Ying', 'Xu, Kai-Lin']","['Li DP', 'Li ZY', 'Sang W', 'Cheng H', 'Pan XY', 'Xu KL']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, No.99 West Huaihai Road, Xuzhou, 221002, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12013-013-9586-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2013;67(3):935-8. doi: 10.1007/s12013-013-9586-8.,3,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel idea for identifying shared gene functional modules using biclustering was proposed in this paper to explore the common molecular mechanisms among cancers and the relationships between different types of cancers. Gene expression datasets for 20 cancers were obtained. And genes differentially expressing in at least two types of cancers were selected using both moderated t-statistic and fold change to construct a 10417 x 20 matrix (gene-cancer matrix). 22 gene clusters shared by cancers were found by using the biclustering method. Further, Gene Ontology (GO)-based enrichment analysis identified 17 gene functional modules (Bonferroni corrected P < 0.05). The involved biological processes primarily included regulation of chromatids separation during mitosis, cell differentiation, immune and inflammatory response, and collagen fibril organization. These modules undertook molecular functions of ATP binding and microtubule motor activity, MHC class II receptor activity, endopeptidase inhibitor activity and so on. And their activity sites were mostly located in cytoskeleton, chromosome, MHC protein complex, intermediate filament, fibrillar collagen and so on. The network constructed based on these modules indicates that gastric cancer, ovarian adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer and mesothelioma were highly relevant to each other. However, the molecular mechanisms of two hematologic malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma) seem very different from other cancers. It can be seen that gene functional modules shared by cancers are associated with many biological mechanisms, and similarities among cancers are probably attributed to cellular origin and shared carcinogenic mechanisms. The proposed method for analysis of pleiotropy in this paper will help understand the common molecular mechanisms for complex human diseases.","['Zhang, Fan', 'Lin, Ai-Hua', 'Lin, Mei-Hua', 'Ding, Yuan-Lin', 'Rao, Shao-Qi']","['Zhang F', 'Lin AH', 'Lin MH', 'Ding YL', 'Rao SQ']","['Shool of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China. lemon_fan@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Yi Chuan,Yi chuan = Hereditas,9436478,IM,"['Computational Biology', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genetic Pleiotropy', 'Humans', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2013/07/28 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0253-9772(2013)3-333-10 [pii]', '10.3724/sp.j.1005.2013.00333 [doi]']",ppublish,Yi Chuan. 2013 Mar;35(3):333-42. doi: 10.3724/sp.j.1005.2013.00333.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a paucity of data on ABL1 kinase mutations in Ph+ patients in Korea. METHODS: We used restriction fragment mass polymorphism (RFMP) analysis to detect ABL1 kinase mutations in blood or bone marrow specimens from 80 Ph+ patients. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients met the criteria for inadequate molecular response (IMR). ABL1 kinase mutations were found in 2.6% of patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 25.0% of accelerated-phase CML, 66.7% of blast-phase CML, and in 58.3% with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Twelve mutations were identified: 7 T315I, 2 E255V, 1 E255K, 1 F359V, and 1 Y253H. The majority of mutation-positive patients showed an unfavorable clinical course and often had an extra Ph or additional chromosomal abnormalities. Mutations were detected in two patients who had very low or absent BCR-ABL1 normalized ratios. CONCLUSION: Mutation analysis should be performed in Ph+ patients exhibiting an IMR to imatinib. RFMP analysis is helpful for revising therapeutic strategies because it can sensitively detect clinically relevant ABL1 kinase mutations with high frequencies.","['Cho, Y-U', 'Kim, S-O', 'Chi, H-S', 'Park, S-J', 'Jang, S', 'Park, C-J', 'Seo, E-J', 'Lee, J-H', 'Lee, J-H', 'Lee, K-H', 'Im, H-J', 'Seo, J-J', 'Hong, S P']","['Cho YU', 'Kim SO', 'Chi HS', 'Park SJ', 'Jang S', 'Park CJ', 'Seo EJ', 'Lee JH', 'Lee JH', 'Lee KH', 'Im HJ', 'Seo JJ', 'Hong SP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130410,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Codon', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2014/07/26 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12091 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2013 Dec;35(6):589-600. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12091.

Immunophenotyping of acute leukemia has gained popularity because of its influence on treatment and prognosis of the disease. The various antigens expressed by the leukemic cells can be assessed by flowcytometry (FCA) and can be used in rendering specific treatment and predicting the outcome of the different types of acute leukemia. AIMS: The main aim of this study was to compare the morphologic and cytochemical diagnoses with flowcytometric diagnoses in acute leukemia and to analyze the usefulness of FCA over morphology. RESULTS: In this study we analyzed 50 cases of acute leukemia and found concordance rate as high as 86% between morphologic/cytochemical diagnosis and flowcytometric diagnosis. Of these, complete concordance was seen in 58% of the cases and partial concordance was seen in 22% of the cases. Non-concordance was seen in only 4% of our cases. In remaining 16% of our cases FCA helped in sub classifying the acute leukemia where morphology and cytochemistry had failed to do so. CD19 and 20 were found to be consistent B-cell markers and CD3 was a very specific marker for T-cell leukemia. CD13 and 33 were important myeloid markers and were aided by other secondary panel of markers like CD14, CD117 and CD41. CONCLUSION: FCA not only helps in confirming morphologic diagnosis in acute leukemia but also helps in assigning specific lineage to the blasts, particularly in acute lymphoid leukemia. Immunophenotyping is of utmost importance in classifying acute leukemia as it greatly influences the treatment and the prognosis.","['Belurkar, Sushma', 'Mantravadi, Himabindu', 'Manohar, Chethan', 'Kurien, Annamma']","['Belurkar S', 'Mantravadi H', 'Manohar C', 'Kurien A']","['Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India. sushbelur@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD7/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/classification/*diagnosis']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2013_9_1_71_110378 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.110378 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2013 Jan-Mar;9(1):71-9. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.110378.,1,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, we discuss why activation of BCR-ABL1, as an outcome of distinct oncogenic events, results in miscellaneous clinical outcomes, and how the intricacy of the BCR-ABL1 signaling network might dictate therapeutic approaches.

We conducted a randomized trial in which such patients were treated with either an augmented intensive regimen of post-induction chemotherapy or a standard regimen of intensive post-induction chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of augmented therapy with standard intensive post induction therapy in children with high-risk ALL who entered remission after a slow response to initial therapy. METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2011, 311 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were either 1 to 9 years of age with white cell counts of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter or 10 years of age or older, had a slow response to initial therapy, and entered remission at the end of induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive standard therapy (156 children) or augmented therapy (155). Those with lymphomatous features were excluded. Event-free survival and overall survival were assessed from the end of induction treatment. RESULTS: The outcome at five years was significantly better in the augmented-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group. The difference between treatments was most pronounced among patients one to nine years of age, all of whom had white-cell counts of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter (P<0.001). Risk factors for an adverse event in the entire cohort included a white-cell count of 200,000 per cubic millimeter or higher (P=0.004). The toxic effects of augmented therapy were considerable but manageable. CONCLUSION: Augmented post-induction chemotherapy results in an excellent outcome for most patients with high-risk ALL and a slow response to initial therapy.","['Rahman, A T M A', 'Gupta, S K', 'Mannan, M A', 'Nahar, K']","['Rahman AT', 'Gupta SK', 'Mannan MA', 'Nahar K']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Shahbagh, Dhaka, Bangladesh.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,Nepal,Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ),101215359,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Time Factors']",,2013/04/12 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3126/kumj.v10i4.10996 [doi]'],ppublish,Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ). 2012 Oct-Dec;10(40):53-9. doi: 10.3126/kumj.v10i4.10996.,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports showed that an L-arginine depleting enzyme, pegylated arginase (BCT-100) may be effective against T-ALL cells. On the other hand, studies including ours had shown the symbiosis of ALL blasts and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) in bone marrow microenvironment during L-asparaginase treatment. As L-asparaginase and BCT-100 both act by depleting lymphoid cells of specific amino acid, we hypothesized that hMSCs may also protect T-ALL blasts from BCT-100 treatment in co-culture and such protection may be abrogated by pre-treating hMSCs with vincristine (VCR). METHODS: XTT assay was used to test sensitivities of T-ALL cell lines and hMSCs to BCT-100. Apoptosis of T-ALL cell lines with or without BCT-100 treatment were tested by annexin V / propidium iodide (AV/PI) assay using flow cytometer. Western blotting was performed to analyze the expression of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), an enzyme involved in L-arginine metabolism which may account for BCT-100 resistance. RESULTS: hMSCs were resistant to BCT-100 while CCRF-CEM, Jurkat and MOLT-4 were very sensitive to it. hMSCs could protect all the three cell lines from BCT-100 treatment in transwell co-culture. All the 3 T-ALL cell lines were also found to be rescued by an L-arginine precursor citrulline, while the breakdown product of BCT-100, ornithine only had limited salvaging effect on CCRF-CEM but not Jurkat and MOLT-4. Both hMSCs and 3 T-ALL cell lines express citrulline synthesis enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) at basal level while only hMSCs could express OTC at relatively higher level under BCT-100 treatment. Treating hMSCs with vincristine before co-culturing with T-ALL could resume the cytotoxicity of BCT-100 to CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a possible strategy to overcome resistance to BCT-100 from cancer microenvironments by suppressing hMSCs either in marrow or in the perivascular niche using vincristine.","['Kwong-Lam, Fung', 'Chi-Fung, Chan Godfrey']","['Kwong-Lam F', 'Chi-Fung CG']","['Department of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China. gcfchan@hku.hk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130410,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,PMC3655039,2013/04/12 06:00,2013/04/12 06:01,['2013/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:01 [medline]']","['2162-3619-2-11 [pii]', '10.1186/2162-3619-2-11 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2013 Apr 10;2(1):11. doi: 10.1186/2162-3619-2-11.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: Our study objectives were to characterize the spectrum of neoplasia in WS using a well-documented study population, and to estimate the type-specific risk of neoplasia in WS relative to the general population. METHODS: We obtained case reports of neoplasms in WS patients through examining previous case series and reviews of WS, as well as through database searching in PubMed, Google Scholar, and J-EAST, a search engine for articles from Japan. We defined the spectrum (types and sites) of neoplasia in WS using all case reports, and were able to determine neoplasm type-specific risk in Japan WS patients by calculating standardized incidence and proportionate incidence ratios (SIR and SPIR, respectively) relative to Osaka Japan prefecture incidence rates. RESULTS: We used a newly assembled study population of 189 WS patients with 248 neoplasms to define the spectrum of neoplasia in WS. The most frequent neoplasms in WS patients, representing 2/3 of all reports, were thyroid neoplasms, malignant melanoma, meningioma, soft tissue sarcomas, leukemia and pre-leukemic conditions of the bone marrow, and primary bone neoplasms. Cancer risk defined by SIRs was significantly elevated in Japan-resident WS patients for the six most frequent neoplasms except leukemia, ranging from 53.5-fold for melanoma of the skin (95% CI: 24.5, 101.6) to 8.9 (95% CI: 4.9, 15.0) for thyroid neoplasms. Cancer risk as defined by SPIR was also significantly elevated for the most common malignancies except leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: WS confers a strong predisposition to several specific types of neoplasia. These results serve as a guide for WS clinical care, and for additional analyses to define the mechanistic basis for cancer in WS and the general population.","['Lauper, Julia M', 'Krause, Alison', 'Vaughan, Thomas L', 'Monnat, Raymond J Jr']","['Lauper JM', 'Krause A', 'Vaughan TL', 'Monnat RJ Jr']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20130401,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk', 'Werner Syndrome/*complications/epidemiology']",PMC3613408,2013/04/11 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0059709 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-38195 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e59709. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0059709.

Further improvement of treatment may depend on the development of targeted therapies. mTOR kinase, a central mediator of several signaling pathways, has recently attracted remarkable attention as a potential target in pediatric ALL. However, limited data exists about the activity of mTOR. In the present study, the amount of mTOR activity dependent phospho-proteins was characterized by ELISA in human leukemia cell lines and in lymphoblasts from childhood ALL patients (n = 49). Expression was measured before and during chemotherapy and at relapses. Leukemia cell lines exhibited increased mTOR activity, indicated by phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6) and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (p-4EBP1). Elevated p-4EBP1 protein levels were detected in ALL samples at diagnosis; efficacy of chemotherapy was followed by the decrease of mTOR activity dependent protein phosphorylation. Optical density (OD) for p-4EBP1 (ELISA) was significantly higher in patients with poor prognosis at diagnosis, and in the samples of relapsed patients. Our results suggest that measuring mTOR activity related phospho-proteins such as p-4EBP1 by ELISA may help to identify patients with poor prognosis before treatment, and to detect early relapses. Determining mTOR activity in leukemic cells may also be a useful tool for selecting patients who may benefit from future mTOR inhibitor treatments.","['Nemes, Karolina', 'Sebestyen, Anna', 'Mark, Agnes', 'Hajdu, Melinda', 'Kenessey, Istvan', 'Sticz, Tamas', 'Nagy, Eszter', 'Barna, Gabor', 'Varadi, Zsofia', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Kopper, Laszlo', 'Csoka, Monika']","['Nemes K', 'Sebestyen A', 'Mark A', 'Hajdu M', 'Kenessey I', 'Sticz T', 'Nagy E', 'Barna G', 'Varadi Z', 'Kovacs G', 'Kopper L', 'Csoka M']","['2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130403,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'ROC Curve', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3616065,2013/04/11 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0059335 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-32510 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e59335. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0059335.

However, the effects of crocin on HL-60 cells in vivo have not been evaluated. This study aimed to examine the effects of crocin on HL-60 cells in vitro and in vivo and investigate the underlying mechanisms. HL-60 cells were treated by crocin, and cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle profiles were examined by MTT assay, AO/EB staining, and flow cytometry, respectively. Furthermore, HL-60 cells were xenografted into nude mice and treated by crocin, the tumor weight and size were calculated, and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in xenografts was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that crocin (0.625-5 mg/mL) inhibited HL-60 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, in a concentration and time-dependent manner. In addition, crocin (6.25, 25 mg/kg) inhibited the tumor weight and size of HL-60 xenografts in nude mice, inhibited Bcl-2 expression, and increased Bax expression in xenografts. In summary, crocin inhibits the proliferation and tumorigenicity of HL-60 cells, which may be mediated by the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and the regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax expression.","['Sun, Yan', 'Xu, Hui-Juan', 'Zhao, Yan-Xia', 'Wang, Ling-Zhen', 'Sun, Li-Rong', 'Wang, Zhi', 'Sun, Xiu-Fang']","['Sun Y', 'Xu HJ', 'Zhao YX', 'Wang LZ', 'Sun LR', 'Wang Z', 'Sun XF']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao 266003, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130319,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,PMC3615578,2013/04/11 06:00,2013/04/11 06:01,['2013/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/690164 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013;2013:690164. doi: 10.1155/2013/690164.

The results showed that GLY markedly reduced cell proliferation and migration with induced differentiation of WEHI-3 cells. The expression level of phosphorylated FAK, Akt, ERK1/2, and Rb was decreased p21 expression while level was increased in WEHI-3 treated with GLY. The results of cell cycle analysis revealed that GLY treatment could markedly induce G1 phase arrest and decrease cell population in S phase. Moreover, experimental results demonstrated that GLY decreased the protein expression and enzyme activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. GLY treatment also reduced WEHI-3 leukemic infiltration in liver and spleen and tumor growth in animal model.

Imatinib is the most common TKI modality used as a frontline therapy in CML across the world. Lately, randomized control trials have shown that second-generation TKI, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, are superior to imatinib in terms of tolerability and efficacy. Therefore, second-generation TKI have been used increasingly as a first choice for patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Recently, ponatinib has shown significant efficacy against the most resistant cases (including those with T315I mutations) with CML. Omacetaxine is a non-TKI agent with a different mechanism of action and has shown benefit in resistant CML. Analysis of other novel agents and newer mechanisms affecting CML stem cells are under exploration. With these developments, the life expectancy of the majority of patients (>90 %) with CML-CP has become comparable to a healthy age-matched individual. The focus has now shifted to achieving faster and deeper responses, considering these parameters as a surrogate for long-term outcome and possibly cures in patients with CML. Adherence to therapy with TKI, proper monitoring by standardized techniques, and adequate use of the available therapies are established rules of managing patients with CML. However, even with these advances, problems of drug resistance, loss of response, kinase domain mutations, transformations in CML (accelerated and blast phase), and patient noncompliance prevail in the community practice.

Analysis of porcine testis cells enriched for spermatogonia using FACS indicated that nearly half of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) expressing testis cells expressed the undifferentiated spermatogonia marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) whereas significantly fewer (P < 0.05) cells selected for thymus cell antigen-1 (Thy-1), also known as cluster of differentiation 90 (CD90), cluster of differentiation 9 (CD9), or other SSC markers expressed PGP 9.5. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein and germ cell lineage marker VASA homolog (VASA), also known as DEAD box protein 4 (DDX4), were expressed by SSEA-1 expressing germ cells. Spermatogonial stem cell xenotransplantation of testis cell populations enriched for cells expressing SSEA-1 generated significantly (P < 0.05; greater than 15-fold) more colonies of donor derived germ cells than unselected testis cells. In conclusion, these data indicate that SSC markers identified in rodents are likely not entirely conserved in pigs and that SSEA-1 is a marker for porcine undifferentiated spermatogonia including SSC in prepubertal boars and its expression may serve as a target for the further study of porcine germ cells.","['Kim, Y-H', 'Kim, B-J', 'Kim, B-G', 'Lee, Y-A', 'Kim, K-J', 'Chung, H-J', 'Hwang, S', 'Woo, J-S', 'Park, J-K', 'Schmidt, J A', 'Pang, M-G', 'Ryu, B-Y']","['Kim YH', 'Kim BJ', 'Kim BG', 'Lee YA', 'Kim KJ', 'Chung HJ', 'Hwang S', 'Woo JS', 'Park JK', 'Schmidt JA', 'Pang MG', 'Ryu BY']","['Department of Animal Science & Technology, Chung-Ang University, Anseong, Gyeonggi-do 456-756, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130409,United States,J Anim Sci,Journal of animal science,8003002,IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Lewis X Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Sus scrofa/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2013/04/11 06:00,2014/02/20 06:00,['2013/04/11 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jas.2012-6139 [pii]', '10.2527/jas.2012-6139 [doi]']",ppublish,J Anim Sci. 2013 Jul;91(7):3143-54. doi: 10.2527/jas.2012-6139.

In this multicenter, randomized phase III trial, we investigate whether the combination of high-dose imatinib and intermediate-dose cytarabine compared to high-dose imatinib alone, improves the rate of major molecular response (MMR) in newly diagnosed CML patients. This study was closed prematurely because of declining inclusion due to the introduction of second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors and only one third of the initially required patients were accrued. One hundred nine patients aged 18-65 years were randomly assigned to either imatinib 800 mg (n = 55) or to imatinib 800 mg in combination with two successive cycles of cytarabine 200 mg/m(2) for 7 days (n = 54). After a median follow-up of 41 months, 67 % of patients were still on protocol treatment. The MMR rate at 12 months was 56 % in the imatinib arm and 48 % in the combination arm (p = 0.39). Progression-free survival was 96 % after 1 year and 89 % after 4 years. Four-year overall survival was 97 %. Adverse events grades 3 and 4 were more common in the combination arm. The addition of intermediate-dose of cytarabine to imatinib did not improve the MMR rate at 12 months. However, the underpowering of the study precludes any definitive conclusions.

A deeper understanding of the architecture of the DNA inside the nucleus is crucial for gaining insight into fundamental processes such as transcriptional regulation, genome dynamics and genome stability. Chromatin conformation capture-based methods, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, are now paving the way for routine genome-wide studies of chromatin 3D structure in a range of organisms and tissues. However, appropriate methods for analyzing such data are lacking. Here, we propose a hypothesis test and an enrichment score of 3D co-localization of genomic elements that handles intra- or interchromosomal interactions, both separately and jointly, and that adjusts for biases caused by structural dependencies in the 3D data. We show that maintaining structural properties during resampling is essential to obtain valid estimation of P-values. We apply the method on chromatin states and a set of mutated regions in leukemia cells, and find significant co-localization of these elements, with varying enrichment scores, supporting the role of chromatin 3D structure in shaping the landscape of somatic mutations in cancer.","['Paulsen, Jonas', 'Lien, Tonje G', 'Sandve, Geir Kjetil', 'Holden, Lars', 'Borgan, Ornulf', 'Glad, Ingrid K', 'Hovig, Eivind']","['Paulsen J', 'Lien TG', 'Sandve GK', 'Holden L', 'Borgan O', 'Glad IK', 'Hovig E']","['Section for Medical Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, PO Box 4950, Nydalen, N-0424 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130409,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*chemistry', 'Chromosomes, Human/chemistry', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC3664813,2013/04/11 06:00,2013/07/26 06:00,['2013/04/11 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt227 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt227 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 May 1;41(10):5164-74. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt227.

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) an aberrant cytokine profile of antigen-specific T-cells with predominant TNF-alpha secretion has previously been described. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these TNF-alpha(+)/IFN-gamma(-) CD8(+) T-cells can also be observed in AML patients after SCT. Eight HLA-A2(+) AML patients at different time points after SCT were evaluated for HLA-A2-restricted CD8(+) T-cell responses against PR3, WT-1 and influenza-A using pentamer staining and different cytokine-based T-cell assays. Antigen-specific T-cell immune responses against influenza-A and PR3 were observed in 4/8 patients, WT-1-specific T-cells could be detected in 3/8 patients. Interestingly, four different cytokine secretion profiles of antigen-specific T-cells were detected: (1) IFN-gamma(+)/TNF-alpha(+), (2) IFN-gamma(+)/TNF-alpha(-), (3) TNF-alpha(+)/IFN-gamma(-) and (4) IFN-gamma(-)/TNF-alpha(-). TNF-alpha(+)/IFN-gamma(-) CD8(+) T-cells are an interesting biological phenomenon which can obviously be observed also in AML patients. This finding has important implications for both T-cell biology and monitoring within immunotherapy trials. The functional characterization of these TNF-alpha(+)/IFN-gamma(-) CD8(+) T-cells needs further investigations.","['Florcken, Anne', 'van Lessen, Antje', 'Terwey, Theis H', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Pezzutto, Antonio', 'Westermann, Jorg']","['Florcken A', 'van Lessen A', 'Terwey TH', 'Dorken B', 'Arnold R', 'Pezzutto A', 'Westermann J']","['Department of Hematology; Oncology, and Tumor Immunology; Charite University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum and Campus Benjamin Franklin; Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130408,United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,IM,"['Adult', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloblastin/*immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3901807,2013/04/11 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/04/11 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['24250 [pii]', '10.4161/hv.24250 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2013 Jun;9(6):1200-4. doi: 10.4161/hv.24250.

Diverse clinical trials demonstrated similar results of current combination chemotherapy regimens succeeding in overall survival rates of more than 80%. However, treatment-related toxicity and the poor prognosis of relapse are serious concerns. Furthermore, specific histological B-NHL subtypes are rare in children and optimal treatment is not established. New treatment modalities are urgently needed for these patient groups. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that is already established in the treatment of adults with mature B-NHL, demonstrated promising results in pediatric patients.

Early work showed a direct correlation between administration of IFN and inhibition of symptoms associated with virally induced leukemia in mice as well as an increase in their survival time. Subsequent studies with purified IFNs confirmed the direct and indirect stimulation of immune cells, resulting in antitumor activities of IFN. Clinically, IFN-alphas (alphas) have been shown to have activity against a variety of tumors. Initially, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensed 2 recombinant IFN-alphas for the treatment of hairy-cell leukemia and then later for several other cancers. The success rate seen with IFNs and certain tumors has been varied. Unfortunately, some neoplasms show no response to IFN. Monocytes/macrophages play an important role in cancer progression. Monocytes in combination with IFN may be an important therapy for several cancers.

In the MPN, IFN has been shown to suppress megakaryopoiesis, inhibit erythroid colony-forming cells, suppress bone marrow fibroblast progenitors, induce cytogenetic remission, and reduce the JAK2 V617F allele burden, sometimes completely. Although efficacy has long been demonstrated in the MPN, toxicities were frequent with recombinant IFN, tempering enthusiasm. However, with pegylated-IFN, because of less toxicity, there has been renewed interest, and recent studies in the MPN have shown hematologic and molecular response or remission in ET and PV; a smaller study in early MF has shown IFN's potential to retard fibrosis. The role of IFN in the treatment of MPN is being re-evaluated on the basis of these studies, and will be better defined as results return from an ongoing international study.","['Stein, Brady L', 'Tiu, Ramon V']","['Stein BL', 'Tiu RV']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine , Chicago, IL 60611, USA. brady-stein@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy', 'Thrombopoiesis/drug effects']",,2013/04/11 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/04/11 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2012.0120 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2013 Apr;33(4):145-53. doi: 10.1089/jir.2012.0120.,4,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'Q46947FE7K (peginterferon alfa-2a)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known, however, about the attitudes and perceptions of parents toward telemedicine, especially potential barriers to implementation. One hundred parents from two regional groups (rural, city) and two childhood cancer groups (leukemia, solid tumor) were surveyed on their understanding and attitudes toward interactive videoconferencing in specific oncology applications. Parents also rated the impact of time and distance factors in complying with cancer treatment, as well as general communication preferences. Parents gave higher ratings for the usefulness of videoconferencing for enhancing psychosocial care or educational opportunities, rather than for clinical uses or treatment planning. Parents' least favored potential application was ""diagnostic services,"" while the most favored was ""contact between separated family."" The best predictor for ratings of future use of interactive video-conferencing, controlling for demographic and attitudinal variables, was parent ratings for use of other communication technologies (e.g., e-mail). There was little evidence that appraisals differed significantly as a function of cancer type, or regional group. Parents of children being treated for cancer are receptive to applications of technology in health care, particularly in facilitating non-medical services (e.g., supportive care, education). The results complement previous research with health professionals serving this patient demographic--that potential barriers to use of telemedicine may reflect personal communication preferences rather than perceptions of relevance or technology access.","['Goodenough, Belinda', 'Cohn, Richard J']","['Goodenough B', 'Cohn RJ']","[""Centre for Children's Cancer & Blood Disorders, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia. b.goodenough@unsw.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Telemed J E Health,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,100959949,IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude to Computers', 'Child', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Hospitals, Rural', 'Hospitals, Urban', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Male', '*Neoplasms', 'New South Wales', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Remote Consultation', 'Sex Distribution', '*Videoconferencing']",,2004/01/01 00:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/04/11 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2004/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Telemed J E Health. 2004;10 Suppl 2:S-15-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ten milliliter of leaves extract was mixed with 90 mL of 0.01 mmol/mL or 0.02 mmol/mL aqueous AgNO3 and exposed to sun light for 1 h. A change from yellowish to reddish brown color was observed. Characterization using UV-vis spectrophotometery and X-ray diffraction analysis were performed. Antimicrobial activity against six microorganisms was tested using well diffusion method and cytoxicity test using 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a yellow tetrazole was obtained on the human leukemia cell line (HL-60). RESULTS: UV-vis spectral analysis showed silver surface plasmon resonance band at 413 nm. X-ray diffraction showed that the particles were crystalline in nature with face centered cubic structure of the bulk silver with broad beaks at 38.50 degrees and 44.76 degrees . The synthesized silver nanoparticles efficiently inhibited various pathogenic organisms and reduced viability of the HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: It has been demonstrated that the extract of E. chapmaniana leaves are capable of producing silver nanoparticles extracellularly and the Ag nanoparticles are quite stable in solution. Further studies are needed to fully characterize the toxicity and the mechanisms involved with the antimicrobial and anticancer activity of these particles.","['Sulaiman, Ghassan Mohammad', 'Mohammed, Wasnaa Hatif', 'Marzoog, Thorria Radam', 'Al-Amiery, Ahmed Abdul Amir', 'Kadhum, Abdul Amir H', 'Mohamad, Abu Bakar']","['Sulaiman GM', 'Mohammed WH', 'Marzoog TR', 'Al-Amiery AA', 'Kadhum AA', 'Mohamad AB']","['Biotechnology Division, Applied Science Department, University of Technology, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Asian Pac J Trop Biomed,Asian Pacific journal of tropical biomedicine,101557706,IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Bacteria/*drug effects', 'Candida albicans/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eucalyptus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry/*toxicity', '*Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Plant Leaves/*chemistry', '*Silver/pharmacology/toxicity']",PMC3609393,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/04/10 06:01,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60024-6 [doi]', 'apjtb-03-01-058 [pii]']",ppublish,Asian Pac J Trop Biomed. 2013 Jan;3(1):58-63. doi: 10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60024-6.,1,,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)']",,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antimicrobial activity', 'Cytotoxic effect', 'Eucalyptus chapmaniana', 'Silver nanoparticles']",,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20130410'],,,

IM is not known to be associated with an increased risk for development of granulomatous diseases. METHODS: We describe our experience with 2 patients (42 and 62 years of age) who developed granulomatous disease during IM treatment for metastatic GIST. RESULTS: Mean duration of IM treatment was 12 (range 8-16) months. Enlarged lymph nodes with increased metabolism on FDG-PET-CT examination were detected and resected. Affected sites were supraclavicular (1) and subcarinal/mediastinal (1) lymph nodes. Histological examination revealed caseating and non-caseating granulomas suggestive of tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected by PCR in lymph nodes of 1 patient who was then successfully treated by anti-tuberculous agents. The other patient had negative sputum test for acid-fast bacilli and PCR-DNA-analysis was negative for M. tuberculosis and other mycobacteria. He received no anti-tuberculous therapy and had no evidence of progressive lymphadenopathy or new lung lesions during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our observations underline the necessity to obtain biopsy material from enlarged or metabolically active lymph nodes developing during IM treatment for timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these rare complications. Follow-up without treatment is safe for patients without detectable microorganisms by sputum examination and PCR.","['Agaimy, Abbas', 'Brueckl, Valeska', 'Schmidt, Daniela', 'Krieg, Stephanie', 'Ullrich, Evelyn', 'Meidenbauer, Norbert']","['Agaimy A', 'Brueckl V', 'Schmidt D', 'Krieg S', 'Ullrich E', 'Meidenbauer N']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20130305,Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,,,PMC3618090,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/04/10 06:01,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000348712 [doi]', 'cro-0006-0134 [pii]']",ppublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2013 Jan;6(1):134-42. doi: 10.1159/000348712.

The aim of this study was to examine the expression of key molecules related to apoptosis (BCL-2, BAX, FAS, FAS-L) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Measurement of BCL-2 and BAX mRNA was performed by quantitative real-time PCR, and membrane expression of FAS and FAS-L was assessed by flow cytometry in bone marrow mononuclear cells, both at diagnosis and at remission following induction chemotherapy. At diagnosis, increased levels of the apoptotic BAX/BCL-2 ratio were observed in children older than 10 years and with higher white blood cell counts. A DNA index < 1.16 was associated with increased BAX/BCL-2, both at diagnosis and at remission, and the del(9p) chromosome abnormality with increased BAX/BCL-2 at remission. The expression of the apoptotic receptor FAS was significantly higher at remission compared to diagnosis, which might reflect enhanced sensitivity of the leukemic clone to apoptosis and response to treatment. Altogether, our results highlight the association of apoptosis-related genes with clinical and cytogenetic prognostic parameters in pediatric ALL. A better understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of apoptosis should enable the design of novel targeted therapies for these patients.","['Kaparou, Maria', 'Choumerianou, Despoina', 'Perdikogianni, Chrysoula', 'Martimianaki, Georgia', 'Kalmanti, Maria', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia']","['Kaparou M', 'Choumerianou D', 'Perdikogianni C', 'Martimianaki G', 'Kalmanti M', 'Stiakaki E']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130304,Brazil,Genet Mol Biol,Genetics and molecular biology,100883590,,,PMC3615527,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/04/10 06:01,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1590/S1415-47572013005000003 [doi]', 'S1415-47572013000100002 [pii]']",ppublish,Genet Mol Biol. 2013 Mar;36(1):7-11. doi: 10.1590/S1415-47572013005000003.

Studying monozygotic twins with ALL provides a unique means of uncovering the timeline of mutations contributing to clonal evolution, pre- and postnatally. We sequenced the whole genomes of leukemic cells from two twin pairs with ALL to comprehensively characterize acquired somatic mutations in ALL, elucidating the developmental timing of all genetic lesions.

RESULTS: At 24 h after SCI, apoptosis and TNFalpha, IL-1beta and MPO concentrations were significantly lower in the rosiglitazone group than in the vehicle and SCI groups. SCI resulted in an increase in Bax and a decrease in Bcl-2, which was reversed by rosiglitazone treatment.

Virus-retentive filters are important tools to assure a high virus safety level of biological medicinal products. Important parameters such as properties of virus spike preparations, mechanism of virus retention by different filter brands, use of prefilters to improve the filtration performance, and, finally, strategies to select the most appropriate filter for a specific product were discussed on the workshop. The panel discussion at the end of the workshop that involved speakers and regulators from different global areas came to following conclusions: The major mechanism of virus retention is size exclusion; filtration, however, is complex and protein and virus can interact with the membrane in multiple ways. Pressure interruption during filtration resulted in enhanced virus passage. It has never been reported that murine leukemia virus (MuLV) passes a parvovirus filter. It makes sense that a small virus can be used to provide a claim for a large virus like MuLV. This relies on the assumption that there is no aggregation or interaction of the model parvovirus with proteins leading to aggregates larger than retroviruses. Several prefilters are under investigation to improve flow rate and throughput of filtration in large-scale manufacture. It was discussed whether the prefilter and the virus-retentive filter can be viewed as one unit operation so that virus retention by both can be claimed as the viral clearance capacity of this manufacturing step. This question engendered some controversy: whereas some saw the combination as a correct reflection of manufacturing conditions, others discussed the different mechanisms of virus retention, which need to be studied separately. All together, the workshop was seen as a valuable forum for the discussion between regulators and industry; it was proposed that such forum should be provided again if possible in connection with one of the next PDA Virus & TSE Safety Conferences. LAY ABSTRACT: The workshop was held on 27 June 2011 in Barcelona, in conjunction with the PDA Virus & TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) Safety Forum 2011. Virus-retentive filters are important tools to assure a high virus safety level of biological medicinal products. Important parameters such as properties of virus spike preparations, mechanism of virus retention by different filter brands, use of prefilters to improve the filtration performance and, finally, strategies to select the most appropriate filter for a specific product were discussed on the workshop. At the end of the workshop, aspects of the discussion were summarized by the following: The major mechanism of virus retention is size exclusion, but interactions are complex. Pressure interruption during filtration resulted in enhanced virus passage. It has never been reported that murine leukemia virus (MuLV) passes a parvovirus filter, and thus the parvovirus may provide a claim for a large virus like MuLV. Combination of prefilter and the virus-retentive filter are seen by some panelists as a correct reflection of manufacturing conditions; others discussed the different mechanisms of virus retention, which need to be studied separately. All together, the workshop was seen as a valuable forum for the discussion between regulators and industry.","['Willkommen, Hannelore', 'Blumel, Johannes', 'Brorson, Kurt', 'Chen, Dayue', 'Chen, Qi', 'Groner, Albrecht', 'Kreil, Thomas R', 'Robertson, James S', 'Ruffing, Michael', 'Ruiz, Sol']","['Willkommen H', 'Blumel J', 'Brorson K', 'Chen D', 'Chen Q', 'Groner A', 'Kreil TR', 'Robertson JS', 'Ruffing M', 'Ruiz S']","['Regulatory Affairs & Biological Safety Consulting, Erzhausen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,PDA J Pharm Sci Technol,PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,9439538,IM,"['Animals', '*Filtration', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Micropore Filters', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Parvovirus', 'Prion Diseases', 'Retroviridae', 'Virus Inactivation', '*Viruses']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['67/2/98 [pii]', '10.5731/pdajpst.2013.00907 [doi]']",ppublish,PDA J Pharm Sci Technol. 2013 Mar-Apr;67(2):98-104. doi: 10.5731/pdajpst.2013.00907.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These habitat impacts could enhance disease risk by increasing contact with domestic animals and by altering patterns of exposure to other wild felids. We performed a serologic survey for feline pathogens in California mountain lions (Puma concolor) using 490 samples from 45 counties collected from 1990 to 2008. Most mountain lions sampled were killed because of depredation or public safety concerns and 75% were adults. Pathogens detected by serosurvey in sampled mountain lions included feline panleukopenia virus (39.0%), feline calicivirus (33.0%), feline coronavirus (FCoV, 15.1%), feline herpesvirus (13.0%), heartworm (12.4%), feline leukemia virus (5.4%), and canine distemper virus (3%). An outbreak of heartworm exposure occurred from 1995 to 2003 and higher than expected levels of FCoV-antibody-positive mountain lions were observed from 2005 to 2008, with foci in southern Mendocino and eastern Lake counties. We show that the majority of mountain lions were exposed to feline pathogens and may be at risk of illness or fatality, particularly kittens. Combined with other stressors, such as ongoing habitat loss, infectious disease deserves recognition for potential negative impact on mountain lion health and population viability.","['Foley, Janet E', 'Swift, Pamela', 'Fleer, Katryna A', 'Torres, Steve', 'Girard, Yvette A', 'Johnson, Christine K']","['Foley JE', 'Swift P', 'Fleer KA', 'Torres S', 'Girard YA', 'Johnson CK']","['Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA. jefoley@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Wildl Dis,Journal of wildlife diseases,0244160,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Domestic/virology', 'Animals, Wild/virology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Calicivirus, Feline/immunology', '*Cat Diseases/epidemiology/transmission/virology', 'Cats', 'Coronavirus, Feline/immunology', 'Distemper Virus, Canine/immunology', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Lions/*virology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['49/2/279 [pii]', '10.7589/2012-08-206 [doi]']",ppublish,J Wildl Dis. 2013 Apr;49(2):279-93. doi: 10.7589/2012-08-206.,2,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytogenetic analysis was carried out on bone marrow directly or after short-period culture. R banding was used for karyotype analysis. BCR/ABL fusion gene was detected with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and chromosome painting was carried out using specific probes. RT-PCR was used to detect BCR/ABL chimeric transcripts. RESULTS: One patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presented three clones, which included one with a normal karyotype, one with t(9;22)(q34;q11), and one with inv(9)(p22q34) involving the der(9)t(9;22) and additional t(8;12)(q12;p11).

CMML-patients with abnormal karyotypes were older than those with normal karyotypes. CMML- patients with normal karyotypes had higher lymphocyte counts than those with abnormal karyotypes. Of 29 patients who had follow-up data, 26 died, with the median survival time being 4 (1-13) months. The median survival of patients with normal and abnormal karyotypes were 4.5 and 3.8 months, respectively (P=0.408). The median survival of CMML- patients with abnormal karyotypes was shorter than those with normal karyotypes (3 and 17 months, P=0.015), but no significant difference was found between the median survival of the two groups of CMML- patients (2.9 and 5.8 months, P=0.629).

One of the main reasons for this difficulty relates to the fact that cancer is not a single disease but consists of hundreds of different types. Furthermore, cancers exhibit considerable genetic complexity with more than 400 different genes implicated in their development. In addition, cancers display major inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. Despite these complexities, several successes have been achieved in recent years. Most of these successes relate to the specific targeting of driver genes involved in cancer development. These successes include imatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and lapatinib) to treat breast cancer, anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib) to treat non-small cell lung cancer, and anti-BRAF agents (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) to treat melanoma.

However, the determinants of sorafenib sensitivity in vivo remain largely unknown. METHODS: We assessed the expression of Mcl-1, activated/phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) 1/2, and activated/phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) in pretreatment tumor specimens from 44 patients with advanced HCC who received sorafenib. Furthermore, we assessed MYC and MET gene copy numbers (GCN) by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Poorer overall survival (OS) times were correlated with pERK expression [hazard ratio (HR) 1.013; 95 % CI 1.003-1.035] and Mcl-1 expression (HR 1.016; 95 % CI 1.002-1.030) in pretreatment tumor samples. Expression levels of pERK and Mcl-1, however, were not correlated with time to tumor progression (TTP). Increased pERK expression was positively associated with higher Cancer of Liver Italian Program scores (P = 0.012) and was prognostic in patients with scores 2-6 but not in those with scores 0-1. pERK expression was significantly less frequent in specimens sourced from previous surgical procedures compared to biopsy samples (9.6 vs. 92.3 %, respectively; P < 0.0001). Analysis of pAKT expression, MET and MYC GCN, did not indicate any prognostic nor predictive values for these biomarkers in terms of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Expression levels of Mcl-1 and pERK are associated with reduced OS in HCC patients treated with sorafenib and might be useful markers for risk stratification. However, in contrast to previous findings, pERK expression levels, as well as other biomarkers tested, did not affect TTP.","['Personeni, Nicola', 'Rimassa, Lorenza', 'Pressiani, Tiziana', 'Destro, Annarita', 'Ligorio, Claudia', 'Tronconi, Maria Chiara', 'Bozzarelli, Silvia', 'Carnaghi, Carlo', 'Di Tommaso, Luca', 'Giordano, Laura', 'Roncalli, Massimo', 'Santoro, Armando']","['Personeni N', 'Rimassa L', 'Pressiani T', 'Destro A', 'Ligorio C', 'Tronconi MC', 'Bozzarelli S', 'Carnaghi C', 'Di Tommaso L', 'Giordano L', 'Roncalli M', 'Santoro A']","['Department of Oncology-Hematology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Via Manzoni 56, 20089 Rozzano, Mi, Italy. nic_personeni@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130409,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sorafenib', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/08/08 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-013-1429-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2013 Jul;139(7):1179-87. doi: 10.1007/s00432-013-1429-x.

In CLL, SF3B1 mutation is associated with more aggressive disease and shorter survival, and recent studies suggest that it can be incorporated into prognostic schema to improve the prediction of disease progression. Mutations in SF3B1 are predominantly subclonal genetic events in CLL, and hence are likely later events in the progression of CLL. Evidence of altered pre-mRNA splicing has been detected in CLL cases with SF3B1 mutations. Although the causative link between SF3B1 mutation and CLL pathogenesis remains unclear, several lines of evidence suggest SF3B1 mutation might be linked to genomic stability and epigenetic modification.","['Wan, Youzhong', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Wan Y', 'Wu CJ']","['Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130408,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/*genetics']",PMC3674664,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/08/07 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58403-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-02-427641 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 6;121(23):4627-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-02-427641.

Sequencing translocation junctions in acute leukemias revealed that the translocations were likely mediated by a DNA double-strand break repair pathway termed nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). There are major 2 types of NHEJ: (1) the classical pathway initiated by the Ku complex, and (2) the alternative pathway initiated by poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Recent reports suggest that classical NHEJ repair components repress translocations, whereas alternative NHEJ components were required for translocations. The rate-limiting step for initiation of alternative NHEJ is the displacement of the Ku complex by PARP1. Therefore, we asked whether PARP1 inhibition could prevent chromosomal translocations in 3 translocation reporter systems. We found that 2 PARP1 inhibitors or repression of PARP1 protein expression strongly repressed chromosomal translocations, implying that PARP1 is essential for this process. Finally, PARP1 inhibition also reduced both ionizing radiation-generated and VP16-generated translocations in 2 cell lines. These data define PARP1 as a critical mediator of chromosomal translocations and raise the possibility that oncogenic translocations occurring after high-dose chemotherapy or radiation could be prevented by treatment with a clinically available PARP1 inhibitor.","['Wray, Justin', 'Williamson, Elizabeth A', 'Singh, Sudha B', 'Wu, Yuehan', 'Cogle, Christopher R', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Lee, Suk-Hee', 'Zhou, Daohong', 'Shao, Lijian', 'Hauer-Jensen, Martin', 'Pathak, Rupak', 'Klimek, Virginia', 'Nickoloff, Jac A', 'Hromas, Robert']","['Wray J', 'Williamson EA', 'Singh SB', 'Wu Y', 'Cogle CR', 'Weinstock DM', 'Zhang Y', 'Lee SH', 'Zhou D', 'Shao L', 'Hauer-Jensen M', 'Pathak R', 'Klimek V', 'Nickoloff JA', 'Hromas R']","['Department of Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130408,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/prevention & control', 'Phthalazines/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics/*physiology']",PMC3663429,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58470-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-10-460527 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 23;121(21):4359-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-10-460527.

However, not all T-cell neoplasms that develop in HTLV-1-infected cases are ATL. Mature T-cell malignancies other than ATL should be carefully excluded in patients infected with HTLV-1, as these sometimes closely resemble ATL in their clinical, morphological, and histological features. Here, we present a case of peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) in an HTLV-1 carrier. Confirmation of monoclonal integration of the virus with Southern blotting leads to a definite diagnosis of ATL. Although we did not detect the monoclonal integration band of HTLV-1 in this case, the high HTLV-1 proviral load complicated the diagnosis. Multicolor flow cytometric analysis clearly showed that HTLV-1 was not integrated in the tumor cells, and facilitated discrimination of PTCL-NOS from ATL.","['Ishigaki, Tomohiro', 'Isobe, Masamichi', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Yuji, Koichiro', 'Ohno, Nobuhiro', 'Watanabe, Nobukazu', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru']","['Ishigaki T', 'Isobe M', 'Kobayashi S', 'Yuji K', 'Ohno N', 'Watanabe N', 'Tojo A', 'Uchimaru K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. ishigaki@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20130409,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Aged', 'Carrier State/*virology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Proviruses', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Virus Integration']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1314-z [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 May;97(5):667-72. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1314-z.

Despite this progress, the majority of children with relapsed leukemia are not expected to survive. With current chemotherapy regimens, approximately 15 % of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 45 % of children with acute myeloid leukemia will have refractory disease or experience a relapse. Advances in the treatment of pediatric relapsed leukemia have not mirrored the successes of upfront therapy, and newer treatments are desperately needed in order to improve survival in these challenging patients. Recent improvements in our knowledge of cancer biology have revealed an extensive number of targets that have the potential to be exploited for anticancer therapy. These advances have led to the development of a number of new treatments that are now being explored in children with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Novel agents seek to exploit the same molecular aberrations that contribute to leukemia development and resistance to therapy. Newer classes of drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and epigenetic modifiers are transforming the treatment of patients who are not cured with conventional therapies. As the side effects of many new agents are distinct from those seen with conventional chemotherapy, these treatments are often explored in combination with each other or combined with conventional treatment regimens.

According to the Cervantes, Dupriez and Mayo scores, most patients were stratified into low-risk group. However, when IPSS and DIPSS-Plus were applied, most patients were classified into an intermediate range, being low risk in only 11 and 13 % of patients, respectively.

Metformin decreases electron transport chain complex I activity, oxygen consumption and mitochondrial ATP synthesis, while stimulating glycolysis for ATP and lactate production, pentose phosphate pathway for purine biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, as well as anaplerotic and mitochondrial gene expression. Importantly, leukemic cells with high basal AKT phosphorylation, glucose consumption or glycolysis exhibit a markedly reduced induction of the Pasteur effect in response to metformin and are resistant to metformin-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, glucose starvation or treatment with deoxyglucose or an AKT inhibitor induces sensitivity to metformin. Overall, metformin elicits reprogramming of intermediary metabolism leading to inhibition of cell proliferation in all leukemic cells and apoptosis only in leukemic cells responding to metformin with AKT phosphorylation and a strong Pasteur effect.","['Scotland, S', 'Saland, E', 'Skuli, N', 'de Toni, F', 'Boutzen, H', 'Micklow, E', 'Senegas, I', 'Peyraud, R', 'Peyriga, L', 'Theodoro, F', 'Dumon, E', 'Martineau, Y', 'Danet-Desnoyers, G', 'Bono, F', 'Rocher, C', 'Levade, T', 'Manenti, S', 'Junot, C', 'Portais, J-C', 'Alet, N', 'Recher, C', 'Selak, M A', 'Carroll, M', 'Sarry, J-E']","['Scotland S', 'Saland E', 'Skuli N', 'de Toni F', 'Boutzen H', 'Micklow E', 'Senegas I', 'Peyraud R', 'Peyriga L', 'Theodoro F', 'Dumon E', 'Martineau Y', 'Danet-Desnoyers G', 'Bono F', 'Rocher C', 'Levade T', 'Manenti S', 'Junot C', 'Portais JC', 'Alet N', 'Recher C', 'Selak MA', 'Carroll M', 'Sarry JE']","['1] INSERM, U1037, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France [2] Universite de Paul Sabatier, Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130409,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Metformin/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013107 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.107 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Nov;27(11):2129-38. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.107.

Serum CA-125 can be elevated in many benign and malignant conditions in which these tissues are involved. METHODS: We measured serum CA-125 concentration in 112 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and evaluated their association with Binet stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG), CD38, 70-kDa zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) mutated status and cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: The high level of CA-125 was associated with advanced Binet stage (r=0.463, p< 0.001), high level of LDH (r=0.404, p< 0.001) and beta2-MG (r=0.274, p=0.004), and unmutated IGHV status (r=0.366, p=0.009). Multivariate analysis showed that advanced Binet (p<0.001) and unmutated IGHV status (p=0.018) were risk factors for the high CA-125 level. In univariate analysis, treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) were affected by Binet stage (p<0.001 and p=0.042, respectively), LDH (p=0.018 and p=0.013, respectively), beta2-MG (p=0.006, TFS only), ZAP-70 (p=0.031, OS only), CD38 (p=0.003, OS only), the presence of del(17p13) or del(11q22.3) (p=0.006 and p=0.049, respectively), IGHV mutation status (p=0.018 and p< 0.001, respectively) and CA-125 (p=0.003 and p=0.034, respectively). In multivariate analysis, only advance Binet stage (p<0.001) was independent risk factor of shorter TFS. CD38-positive (p=0.020) and unmutated IGHV status (p=0.034) were independent risk factors of worse OS. CONCLUSIONS: The results support a high CA-125 level correlates significantly with many clinical features of advanced stage, poor prognostic factors, and worse TFS and OS. However, CA-125 is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with CLL.","['Zou, Zhi-Jian', 'Fan, Lei', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhang, Run', 'Zhang, Li-Na', 'Yang, Shu', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Xu, Wei']","['Zou ZJ', 'Fan L', 'Wang L', 'Zhang R', 'Zhang LN', 'Yang S', 'Li JY', 'Xu W']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'CA-125 Antigen/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'ROC Curve', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2012/01/01 00:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10754232V6KW3482 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-130304 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2012;12(4):169-76. doi: 10.3233/CBM-130304.,4,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CA-125 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we found that prohibitins play a role as counter receptors for Siglec-9 expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. Siglec-9 bound to prohibitins in a sialic acid-independent manner. Mutated Siglec-9 with Arg(120) changed to Ala lost the binding activity, suggesting a specific ionic peptide-peptide interaction. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in Jurkat cells on treatment with anti-CD3 antibody immobilized beads was markedly diminished on treatment with anti-CD3 antibody and Siglec-9 co-immobilized beads, indicating that engagement of prohibitins with Siglec-9 inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of c-Raf was also reduced, maybe due to inhibition of the c-Raf-prohibitin interaction by Siglec-9 ligation. In parallel with inhibition of the ERK cascade, IL-2 production was markedly decreased in Jurkat cells. Thus, this interaction may be a useful immunotherapeutic target.","['Yurugi, Hajime', 'Tanida, Shuhei', 'Akita, Kaoru', 'Ishida, Akiko', 'Toda, Munetoyo', 'Nakada, Hiroshi']","['Yurugi H', 'Tanida S', 'Akita K', 'Ishida A', 'Toda M', 'Nakada H']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kyoto Sangyo University, Kamigamo-Motoyama, Kyoto 603-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130406,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prohibitins', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)00549-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.085 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 May 3;434(2):376-81. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.085.

Patients with poor-risk molecular/cytogenetics and/or inadequate response to up-front therapy are typically considered high-risk (HR) and historically have poor outcomes with chemotherapy alone. We investigated whether allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) with best available donor in first remission (CR1) would abrogate the poor outcomes associated with HR AML in children and young adults treated with chemotherapy. We reviewed the outcomes of 50 consecutive children and young adults (ages 0 to 30 years) with AML who received a myeloablative allo-HCT between 2001 and 2010. Thirty-six patients (72%) were HR, defined as having FLT3-ITD mutations, 11q23 MLL rearrangements, chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities, induction failure, and/or having persistent disease. The majority of patients received cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation conditioning, and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine based. Transplantation outcomes for HR patients were compared to standard-risk patients, with no significant differences observed in overall survival (72% versus 78%, P = .72), leukemia-free survival (69% versus 79%, P = .62), relapse (11% versus 7%, P = .71), or treatment-related mortality (17% versus 14%, P = .89).

Targets of action span multiple mechanisms deregulated during cancer progression, ranging from altered carcinogen metabolism to the restoration of epigenetic machinery. Furthermore, the developing fetus is highly susceptible to changes in nutritional status and to environmental toxicants. Thus, we have exploited a mouse model of transplacental carcinogenesis to assess the impact of maternal dietary supplementation on cancer risk in offspring. In this study, transplacental and lactational exposure to a maternal dose of 15mg/Kg B.W. of dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBC) resulted in significant morbidity of offspring due to an aggressive T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. As in previous studies, indole-3-carbinol (I3C, feed to the dam at 100, 500 or 1000ppm), derived from cruciferous vegetables, dose-dependently reduced lung tumor multiplicity and also increased offspring survival. Brussels sprout and broccoli sprout powders, selected for their relative abundance of I3C and the bioactive component sulforaphane (SFN), respectively, surprisingly enhanced DBC-induced morbidity and tumorigenesis when incorporated into the maternal diet at 10% wt/wt. Purified SFN, incorporated in the maternal diet at 400ppm, also decreased the latency of DBC-dependent morbidity. Interestingly, I3C abrogated the effect of SFN when the two purified compounds were administered in equimolar combination (500ppm I3C and 600ppm SFN). SFN metabolites measured in the plasma of neonates positively correlated with exposure levels via the maternal diet but not with offspring mortality. These findings provide justification for further study of the safety and bioactivity of cruciferous vegetable phytochemicals at supplemental concentrations during the perinatal period.","['Shorey, Lyndsey E', 'Madeen, Erin P', 'Atwell, Lauren L', 'Ho, Emily', 'Lohr, Christiane V', 'Pereira, Clifford B', 'Dashwood, Roderick H', 'Williams, David E']","['Shorey LE', 'Madeen EP', 'Atwell LL', 'Ho E', 'Lohr CV', 'Pereira CB', 'Dashwood RH', 'Williams DE']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130406,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzopyrenes/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Diet/methods', 'Female', 'Indoles/*administration & dosage', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Lung Neoplasms/diet therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/drug effects/physiology', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diet therapy/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Sulfoxides', 'Thiocyanates/*administration & dosage']",PMC3999518,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(13)00124-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2013.02.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2013 Jul 1;270(1):60-9. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2013.02.016.

In 1891 William B. Coley injected bacteria into inoperable cancer (bone sarcoma) and observed tumor shrinkage. He is recognized as the ""'""Father of Immunotherapy""'"". Cancer immunotherapy is based on the ability of the immune system to recognize cancer cells and to affect their growth and expansion. Beside the fact that, tumor cells are genetically distinct from their normal counterparts, and should be recognized and eliminated by immune system, the tumor associated antigens (TAAs) are often poorly immunogenic due to immunoediting. This process allows tumor to evolve during continuous interactions with the host immune system, and eventually escape from immune surveillance. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment consists of immunosuppressive cells that release immunosuppressive factors including IL-6, IL-10, IDO, TGFbeta or VEGF. Interactions between cancer and stroma cells create network of immunosuppressive pathways, while activation of immune defense is inhibited. A key to successful immunotherapy is to overcome the local immunosuppression within tumor microenvironment and activate mechanisms that lead to tumor eradication. There are two clinical approaches of immunotherapy: active and passive. Active immunotherapy involves stimulation of immune response to tumor associated antigens (TAAs), either non-specifically via immunomodulating agents or specifically employing cancer vaccines. This review presents the progress and breakthroughs in design, development and clinical application of selected cell-based tumor vaccines achieved due to the generation and development of gene transfer technologies.","['Kozlowska, Anna', 'Mackiewicz, Jacek', 'Mackiewicz, Andrzej']","['Kozlowska A', 'Mackiewicz J', 'Mackiewicz A']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130406,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Cancer Vaccines/*genetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Active/methods', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Tissue Extracts/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/genetics/immunology']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(13)00310-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.056 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2013 Aug 10;525(2):200-7. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.056.

Although the DNA damage response within the whole genome has been extensively studied, the region-specific characteristics of nuclear sub-compartments such as the nucleolus or fragile sites have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that the heterochromatin protein HP1 and PML protein recognize spontaneously occurring 53BP1- or gamma-H2AX-positive DNA lesions throughout the genome. Moreover, 53BP1 nuclear bodies, which co-localize with PML bodies, also occur within the nucleoli compartments. Irradiation of the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS with gamma-rays increases the degree of co-localization between 53BP1 and PML bodies throughout the genome; however, the 53BP1 protein is less abundant in chromatin of ribosomal genes and fragile sites (FRA3B and FRA16D) in gamma-irradiated cells. Most epigenomic marks on ribosomal genes and fragile sites are relatively stable in both non-irradiated and gamma-irradiated cells. However, H3K4me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3K79me1 were significantly changed in promoter and coding regions of ribosomal genes after exposure of cells to gamma-rays. In fragile sites, gamma-irradiation induces a decrease in H3K4me3, changes the levels of HP1beta, and modifies the levels of H3K9 acetylation, while the level of H3K9me3 was relatively stable. In these studies, we confirm a specific DNA-damage response that differs between the ribosomal genes and fragile sites, which indicates the region-specificity of DNA repair.","['Foltankova, Veronika', 'Legartova, Sona', 'Kozubek, Stanislav', 'Hofer, Michal', 'Bartova, Eva']","['Foltankova V', 'Legartova S', 'Kozubek S', 'Hofer M', 'Bartova E']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., Kralovopolska 135, CZ-612 65, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130406,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Chromosome Fragile Sites/*genetics', 'DNA Damage/*radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/radiation effects', 'Fibroblasts/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genomic Instability', 'Histones/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Ribosomes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(13)00402-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2013 Jun 15;522(2):156-67. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.108.

The need for prompt assessment and early intervention for infection is widely recognized by ED staff as best practice; however, the average length of time to antibiotic administration varies widely in published studies. METHODS: An interdisciplinary quality improvement initiative including physician, nursing, and pharmacy leaders was created to streamline the identification and treatment for this high-risk population. Based on published evidence for best practice and national recognition of the need for rapid treatment, the goal was set for administration of antibiotic therapy to less than 60 minutes after ED arrival. This project was conducted at 2 emergency departments in a pediatric health care system with 520 beds and a level I and level II trauma designation. Approximately 154,000 patients are seen annually. In the emergency departments, 271 staff members, including registered nurses, paramedics, and patient care technicians, required education about using the newly designed process. Records from all patients with fever and a known history of pediatric cancer who presented to the emergency departments were included in the retrospective review, including patients with solid tumors, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Exclusion criteria included patients in known remission, those with prior antibiotic therapy at another facility, congenital neutropenia, or parental concern or objection to treatment. A retrospective medical record review of febrile oncology patients treated from September 2008 until May 2012 was conducted to evaluate the impact of this evidence-based practice change to streamline the ""door to drug"" process. The average length of time until antibiotic administration, nurses' compliance initiating the protocol, and ED length of stay were determined. RESULTS: The review included 2758 medical records. During the study period from 2008 to 2012, one emergency department's average time for drug administration dropped from 103 to 44 minutes, and the second dropped from 141 to 61 minutes. Both campuses also improved their protocol compliance, with ED 1 increasing from 24% to 78% and ED 2 improving from 30% to 84%. DISCUSSION: This quality initiative has direct application for all ED leaders who treat children with cancer. High-risk patients can benefit from a streamlined nurse-initiated process that decreases negative consequences of fever.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in lymphoid differentiation, and aberrant miRNA expression has been associated with treatment outcome in lymphoid malignancies. Here, we evaluated miRNA expression profiles in normal thymocytes, mature T-cells, and T-ALL samples with and without CD56 expression and correlated microRNA expression with treatment outcome. METHODS: The gene expression profile of 164 miRNAs were compared for T-ALL/CD56+ (n=12) and T-ALL/CD56- (n=36) patients by Real-Time Quantitative PCR. Based on this analysis, we decided to evaluate miR-221 and miR-374 expression in individual leukemic and normal samples. RESULTS: miR-221 and miR-374 were expressed at significantly higher levels in T-ALL/CD56+ than in T-ALL/CD56- cells and in leukemic blasts compared with normal thymocytes and peripheral blood (PB) T-cells. Age at diagnosis (15 or less vs grater than 15 years; HR: 2.19, 95% CI: 0.98-4.85; P=0.05), miR-221 expression level (median value as cut off in leukemic samples; HR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.45-6.92; P=0.004), and the expression of CD56 (CD56-vs CD56+; HR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.37-6.51; P=0.006) were predictive factors for shorter overall survival; whereas, only CD56 expression (HR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.03-7.18; P=0.041) was associated with a shorter disease-free survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: miR-221 is highly expressed in T-ALL and its expression level may be associated with a poorer prognosis.","['Gimenes-Teixeira, Hamilton L', 'Lucena-Araujo, Antonio R', 'Dos Santos, Guilherme A', 'Zanette, Dalila L', 'Scheucher, Priscila S', 'Oliveira, Luciana C', 'Dalmazzo, Leandro F', 'Silva-Junior, Wilson A', 'Falcao, Roberto P', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['Gimenes-Teixeira HL', 'Lucena-Araujo AR', 'Dos Santos GA', 'Zanette DL', 'Scheucher PS', 'Oliveira LC', 'Dalmazzo LF', 'Silva-Junior WA', 'Falcao RP', 'Rego EM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. emrego@hcrp.fmrp.usp.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130408,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,PMC3637292,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/04/10 06:01,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['2162-3619-2-10 [pii]', '10.1186/2162-3619-2-10 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2013 Apr 8;2(1):10. doi: 10.1186/2162-3619-2-10.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All PNA drugs have a chemical structure similar to adenosine or guanosine, and they have similar mechanisms of action. They have many intracellular targets: they act as antimetabolites, competing with natural nucleosides during DNA or RNA synthesis, and as inhibitors of key cell enzymes. In contrast to other antineoplastic drugs, PNAs act cytotoxically, both in the mitotic and quiescent cell cycle phases. In the last few years, three PNAs have been approved for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies and other hematological disorders: 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), fludarabine and pentostatin. 2-CdA and fludarabine are also active in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These drugs, in combination with cytarabine and other agents, are commonly used as salvage regimens in relapsed or refractory AML. Moreover, the addition of 2-CdA to the standard induction regimen is associated with an increased rate of complete remission and improved survival of adult patients with AML. More recently three novel PNAs have been synthesized and introduced into clinical trials: clofarabine, nelarabine and forodesine. Clofarabine is the most promising PNA in current clinical trials in pediatric and adult patients with acute leukemias. Nelarabine is more cytotoxic in T-lineage than in B-lineage leukemias. Clofarabine and nelarabine have been approved for the treatment of refractory patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Clofarabine is also an active drug in AML treatment when administered either alone or in combination regimens as front-line treatment and in relapsed or refractory patients. Unlike other PNA, forodesine is not incorporated into DNA but displays a highly selective purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitory action. Forodesine is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of T-cell malignancies, including T-cell ALL. This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties and clinical activity and toxicity of PNAs, as well as their emerging role in lymphoid and myeloid acute leukemias.","['Robak, Pawel', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Robak P', 'Robak T']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 93-510 Lodz, ul.

MDS is a group of heterogeneous oncohematological bone marrow disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, blood cytopenias, and progression of the disease toward acute myeloid leukemia. The aim of this study was to search for plasma proteome changes in MDS patients with refractory anemia and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts. RESULTS: A total of 26 patient and healthy donor plasma samples were depleted of fourteen high-abundant plasma proteins, separated with 2D electrophoresis, and statistically processed with Progenesis SameSpots software. 55 significantly differing spots were observed and corresponded to 39 different proteins identified by nanoLC-MS/MS. Changes in the fragments of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 protein were observed. Using mass spectrometry-based relative label-free quantification of tryptic peptides, there were differences in alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein peptides, while no differences were observed between the control and patient sample groups for retinol-binding protein 4 peptides. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes plasma proteome changes associated with MDS patients with refractory anemia and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts. Changes observed in the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 fragments were in agreement with our previous studies of other MDS subgroups: refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and refractory anemia with excess blasts subtype 1. Mass spectrometry-based relative quantification of retinol-binding protein 4 peptides has shown that there are differences in the modification of this protein between refractory anemia with excess blasts subtype 1 patients and MDS patients with refractory anemia and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein seems to be a new potential MDS biomarker candidate.","['Majek, Pavel', 'Riedelova-Reicheltova, Zuzana', 'Suttnar, Jiri', 'Pecankova, Klara', 'Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Dyr, Jan E']","['Majek P', 'Riedelova-Reicheltova Z', 'Suttnar J', 'Pecankova K', 'Cermak J', 'Dyr JE']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, Prague 2, 128 20, Czech Republic. pavel.majek@uhkt.cz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130408,England,Proteome Sci,Proteome science,101170539,,,PMC3635902,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/04/10 06:01,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['1477-5956-11-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-5956-11-14 [doi]']",epublish,Proteome Sci. 2013 Apr 8;11(1):14. doi: 10.1186/1477-5956-11-14.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison was made to leukemic cells treated in suspension, or grown on a hu-BM-MSC monolayer (2D conditions). We demonstrated that leukemic cells cultured in 3D were more resistant to drug-induced apoptosis compared to cells cultured in 2D or in suspension. We also demonstrated significant differences in leukemic cell response to chemotherapy using different leukemic cell lines cultured in 3D. We suggest that the differential responses to chemotherapy in 3D may be related to the expression of N-cadherin in the co-culture system.

However, evidence of the antimicrobial as well as the cytotoxic effects of many of them has not been investigated. In the present study, aqueous and methanol extracts from barks, seeds, leaves and roots of three Cameroonian edible plants namely Garcina lucida, Fagara heitzii and Hymenocardia lyrata were evaluated for their cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. METHODS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were assessed by the broth micro-dilution method meanwhile the cytotoxicity was performed using sulphorhodamine B assay (SRB) against the human leukemia THP-1, the alveolar epithelial A549, prostate cancer PC-3, breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 and cervical cancer HeLa cell lines. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the seven tested extracts ranged from 62.5 mug/ml to 1000 mug/ml. The methanol (MeOH) extract from the roots of H. lyrata showed the highest antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and S. epidermitis. The best antifungal activity was obtained with the MeOH extract from the leaves of G. lucida against C. tropicalis (MIC value of 62.5 mug/ml). The in vitro antiproliferative activity revealed that, extract from the bark of F. heitzii and extract from H. lyrata roots had significant cytotoxic activity on THP-1 (IC50 8.4 mug/ml) and PC-3 (IC50 9.5 mug/ml) respectively.

We systematically analysed the risks (standardized incidence ratio, SIR) and survival (hazard ratio, HR) in nine types of leukaemia among 402 462 patients hospitalized for any of 33 AI diseases and compared to persons not hospitalized for AI diseases. Risk for all leukaemia was increased after 13 AI diseases and survival was decreased after six AI diseases. SIRs were increased after all AI diseases for seven types of leukaemia, including SIR 1.69 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-2.19) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 1.85 (95% CI: 1.65-2.07) for acute myeloid leukaemia, 1.68 (95% CI: 1.37-2.04) for chronic myeloid leukaemia, 2.20 (95% CI: 1.69-2.81) for 'other myeloid leukaemia', 2.45 (95% 1.99-2.98) for 'other and unspecified leukaemia', 1.81 (95% CI: 1.11-2.81) for monocytic leukaemia, and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.08-1.69) for myelofibrosis.

Curiously, this phenotype was also observed by Warburg in embryonic tissues, and recent research demonstrated that normal stem cells may indeed rely on aerobic glycolysis - fermenting pyruvate to lactate in the presence of ample oxygen - rather than on the complete oxidation of pyruvate in the Krebs cycle - to generate cellular energy (Folmes et al., 2012). However, it remains to be determined whether this phenotype is causative for neoplastic development, or rather the result of malignant transformation. In addition, in light of mounting evidence demonstrating that cancer cells can carry out electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, although in some cases predominantly using electrons from non-glucose carbon sources (Bloch-Frankenthal et al., 1965), Warburg's hypothesis needs to be revisited. Lastly, recent evidence suggests that the leukemia bone marrow microenvironment promotes the Warburg phenotype adding another layer of complexity to the study of metabolism in hematological malignancies. In this review we will discuss some of the evidence for alterations in the intermediary metabolism of leukemia cells and present evidence for a concept put forth decades ago by lipid biochemist Feodor Lynen, and acknowledged by Warburg himself, that cancer cell mitochondria uncouple ATP synthesis from electron transport and therefore depend on glycolysis to meet their energy demands (Lynen, 1951; Warburg, 1956).","['Velez, Juliana', 'Hail, Numsen Jr', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Kojima, Kensuke', 'Samudio, Ismael', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Velez J', 'Hail N Jr', 'Konopleva M', 'Zeng Z', 'Kojima K', 'Samudio I', 'Andreeff M']","['Grupo de Terapia Celular y Molecular Laboratorio de Bioquimica, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Bogota, Colombia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130402,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,PMC3613776,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/04/09 06:01,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00067 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 Apr 2;3:67. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00067. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Krebs cycle', 'OXPHOS', 'anaplerosis', 'apoptosis', 'cataplerosis', 'electron transport', 'microenvironment', 'mitochondrial uncoupling']",,,,,,,

Deficiency in Stat5 causes impaired cytokine-mediated proliferation and survival of progenitors and their differentiated descendants along major hematopoietic lineages such as erythroid, lymphoid, and myeloid cells. Overexpression and persistent activation of Stat5 are sufficient for neoplastic transformation and development of multi-lineage leukemia in a transplant model. Little is known, however, whether a continuous activation of this signal transducer is essential for the maintenance of hematopoietic malignancies. To address this issue, we developed transgenic mice that express a hyperactive mutant of Stat5 in hematopoietic progenitors and derived lineages in a ligand-controlled manner. In contrast to the transplant model, expression of mutant Stat5 did not adversely affect normal hematopoiesis in the presence of endogenous wildtype Stat5 alleles. However, the gain-of-function of this signal transducer in mice that carry Stat5a/b hypomorphic alleles resulted in abnormally high numbers of circulating granulocytes that caused severe airway obstruction. Downregulation of hyperactive Stat5 in diseased animals restored normal granulopoiesis, which also resulted in a swift clearance of granulocytes from the lung. Moreover, we demonstrate that Stat5 promotes the initiation and maintenance of severe granulophilia in a cell autonomous manner. The results of this study show that the gain-of-function of Stat5 causes excessive granulopoiesis and prolonged survival of granulocytes in circulation. Collectively, our findings underline the critical importance of Stat5 in maintaining a normal balance between myeloid and lymphoid cells during hematopoiesis, and we provide direct evidence for a function of Stat5 in granulophilia-associated pulmonary dysfunction.","['Lin, Wan-chi', 'Schmidt, Jeffrey W', 'Creamer, Bradley A', 'Triplett, Aleata A', 'Wagner, Kay-uwe']","['Lin WC', 'Schmidt JW', 'Creamer BA', 'Triplett AA', 'Wagner KU']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130402,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Lung/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3614894,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060902 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-37645 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60902. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060902.

Elevated levels of Pim1 kinase were first discovered in human leukemia and lymphomas. However, more recently Pim1 was found to be increased in solid tumors, including pancreatic and prostate cancers, and has been proposed as a prognostic marker. Although the Pim kinases have been identified as oncogenes in transgenic models, they have weak transforming abilities on their own. However, they have been shown to greatly enhance the ability of other genes or chemical carcinogens to induce tumors. To explore the role of Pim1 in prostate cancer, we generated conditional Pim1 transgenic mice, expressed Pim1 in prostate epithelium, and analyzed the contribution of PIM1 to neoplastic initiation and progression. Accordingly, we explored the effect of PIM1 overexpression in 3 different settings: upon hormone treatment, during aging, and in combination with the absence of one Pten allele. We have found that Pim1 overexpression increased the severity of mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasias (mPIN) moderately in all three settings. Furthermore, Pim1 overexpression, in combination with the hormone treatment, increased inflammation surrounding target tissues leading to pyelonephritis in transgenic animals. Analysis of senescence induced in these prostatic lesions showed that the lesions induced in the presence of inflammation exhibited different behavior than those induced in the absence of inflammation. While high grade prostate preneoplastic lesions, mPIN grades III and IV, in the presence of inflammation did not show any senescence markers and demonstrated high levels of Ki67 staining, untreated animals without inflammation showed senescence markers and had low levels of Ki67 staining in similar high grade lesions. Our data suggest that Pim1 might contribute to progression rather than initiation in prostate neoplasia.","['Narlik-Grassow, Maja', 'Blanco-Aparicio, Carmen', 'Cecilia, Yolanda', 'Perez, Marco', 'Munoz-Galvan, Sandra', 'Canamero, Marta', 'Renner, Oliver', 'Carnero, Amancio']","['Narlik-Grassow M', 'Blanco-Aparicio C', 'Cecilia Y', 'Perez M', 'Munoz-Galvan S', 'Canamero M', 'Renner O', 'Carnero A']","['Experimental Therapeutics programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130402,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Hormones/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*genetics', 'Ki-67 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Prostate/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia/genetics/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transgenes']",PMC3614961,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060277 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-31306 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60277. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060277.

In this paper, we review four successive studies on the basis of acute myeloid leukemia-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (AML-BFM) protocol, in which a stepwise improvement of treatment outcome was observed. Treatment results of the last protocol AML-BFM 2004 Interim are presented in detail. METHODS: Three hundred and three patients with de novo AML were treated according to the AML-BFM 2004 Interim at 15 Polish centers from January 1, 2005 to June 30, 2011. A confrontation with previous treatment periods was based upon historical, already published data. RESULTS: In four consecutive periods, 723 children were eligible for evaluation (208, 83, 195, and 237, respectively). Complete remission rates in consecutive periods were: 71, 68, 81 and 87 %, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates, event-free survival rates, and relapse-free survival rates were 33, 32, and 45%, respectively for AML-PPLLSG 83 regimen; 38, 36, and 53 % respectively for AML-PPLLSG 94 regimen; 53, 46, and 65 % respectively for AML-PPLLSG 98 regimen, and 63, 52, and 64 % for AML-BFM Interim 2004, respectively. Incidence of early deaths and that due to complications (mainly infections) in the first remission decreased over time from 22 to 4.6 % and from 10 to 5.9 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite continuous improvement in the treatment outcome, the number of failures still remains too high. Further progress seemed to be possible due to continued cooperation of oncology centers within large international study groups.","['Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Pawinska-Wasikowska, Katarzyna', 'Klekawka, Tomasz', 'Czogala, Malgorzata', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Fic-Sikorska, Barbara', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska, Lucyna', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Potocka, Kinga', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Skalska-Sadowska, Jolanta', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Wojcik, Beata', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Koltan, Sylwia', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Stolarska, Malgorzata', 'Urasinski, Tomasz', 'Kamienska, Elzbieta', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Tomaszewska, Renata', 'Sobol, Grazyna', 'Mizia-Malarz, Agnieszka', 'Karolczyk, Grazyna', 'Podhorecka, Joanna', 'Wieczorek, Maria', 'Karpinska-Derda, Irena', 'Badowska, Wanda', 'Moryl-Bujakowska, Angelina']","['Balwierz W', 'Pawinska-Wasikowska K', 'Klekawka T', 'Czogala M', 'Matysiak M', 'Fic-Sikorska B', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska L', 'Chybicka A', 'Potocka K', 'Wachowiak J', 'Skalska-Sadowska J', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Wojcik B', 'Wysocki M', 'Koltan S', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Mlynarski W', 'Stolarska M', 'Urasinski T', 'Kamienska E', 'Szczepanski T', 'Tomaszewska R', 'Sobol G', 'Mizia-Malarz A', 'Karolczyk G', 'Podhorecka J', 'Wieczorek M', 'Karpinska-Derda I', 'Badowska W', 'Moryl-Bujakowska A']","['Pediatric, Oncology and Hematology Department, PA Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, ul.

CRM1 is involved in nuclear export of tumor suppressors such as p53. We investigated the prognostic significance of CRM1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and effects of a novel small-molecule selective inhibitor of CRM1. CRM1 protein expression was determined in 511 newly diagnosed AML patients and was correlated with mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) and p53 levels. High CRM1 expression was associated with short survival of patients and remained an adverse prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. CRM1 inhibitor KPT-185 induced mainly full-length p53 and apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner, whereas inhibition of proliferation was p53 independent. Patient samples with p53 mutations showed low sensitivity to KPT-185. Nuclear retention of p53 induced by CRM1 inhibition synergized with increased levels of p53 induced by MDM2 inhibition in apoptosis induction. KPT-185 and Nutlin-3a, alone and in combination, induced synergistic apoptosis in patient-derived CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML, but not in normal progenitor cells. Data suggest that CRM1 exerts an antiapoptotic function and is highly prognostic in AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The influence of phage preparation on migration of HL-60 leukemia cells was evaluated with BD Bioscience Migration Chambers. RESULTS: Bacteriophages have no influence on migration of HL-60 cells. The only phage preparation which stimulated migration of HL-60 cells was Staph.liz, specific to S. aureus, however, the molecular basis of these interactions cannot be currently explained.

To identify candidate cytokines that are involved in the activation of JAK2/STAT5 in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells, we compared the cytokine expression profiles of CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells and their CD34(+)/CD38(+) counterparts. Interestingly, freshly isolated CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells from patients (n = 17) expressed less interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) than their CD34(+)/CD38(+) counterparts and CD34(+) normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from healthy volunteers (n = 6), as measured by real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Methylation-specific PCR found that IL-1B gene expression was silenced by methylation of the promoter region. Importantly, exposure of CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells to IL-1beta (100 ng/ml) stimulated cell-cycle progression, induced apoptosis and sensitized these cells to growth inhibition by antileukemia agents. These changes occurred in conjunction with the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf1, antiapoptotic proteins and p-STAT5. Forced expression of IL-1beta in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells by lentiviral transduction significantly impaired the self-renewal capacity of the cells and induced apoptosis. Additionally, when these CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells with forced expression of IL-1beta were transplanted into severely immunocompromised mice, the engraftment of the cells and reconstitution of AML were significantly impaired. Taken together, our results indicate that the inhibition of STAT5 by IL-1beta may be a promising treatment strategy to eradicate leukemia stem cells in AML.","['Yang, Jing', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Nishioka, Chie', 'Nobumoto, Atsuya', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Yang J', 'Ikezoe T', 'Nishioka C', 'Nobumoto A', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130506,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28198 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Oct 15;133(8):1967-81. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28198.

To study the cooperating leukemogenesis by MLL/AF10 and KRAS mutation, we retrovirally transduced MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRASG12C into mouse bone marrow cells and generated two immortalized cell lines. The cells carrying cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRASG12C had immature myelomonocytic phenotypes. Compared to a previously established cell line carrying MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) alone, cooperation of MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with KRASG12C blocked the cells at a more immature myelomonocytic stage with reduced expression of monocyte/macrophage markers.

Cooperation of MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with KRASG12C increased cell adhesion via upregulation of an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr125. Knockdown of Gpr125 in the cells by short hairpin RNA reduced cell aggregation and diminished MS formation in the transplanted mice. Our results indicated that upregulation of Gpr125 by cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRASG12C promoted cell adhesion and contributed to the MS formation.","['Fu, Jen-Fen', 'Yen, Tzung-Hai', 'Chen, Yu', 'Huang, Ying-Jung', 'Hsu, Cheng-Lung', 'Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Shih, Lee-Yung']","['Fu JF', 'Yen TH', 'Chen Y', 'Huang YJ', 'Hsu CL', 'Liang DC', 'Shih LY']","['Department of Medical Research, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130507,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Adipose Tissue', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28195 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Oct 15;133(8):1792-802. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28195.

All patients subsequently received combined maintenance treatment. The trial had been prematurely terminated due to significantly more relapses in the no AraC group (J Clin Oncol, (24) 2006, 5703-10), but follow-up was still relatively short.

Thus, in the present study, the correlation between the expression levels of AQP9 and sensitivity to ATO was investigated using two acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell lines, NB4 and HT93A, as well as primary APL cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed APL patients. A substantially higher sensitivity to ATO-mediated induction of apoptosis was observed in the NB4 cells when compared to that in the HT93A cells. In addition, markedly higher expression levels of AQP9, as assessed using flow cytometry, along with more intracellular arsenic accumulation, were observed in the NB4 cells. More importantly, similar to APL cell lines, the trend of expression levels of AQP9 correlated closely with the differential sensitivity to ATO-mediated induction of apoptosis in primary APL cells. In contrast, no correlation was observed between ATO sensitivity associated with AQP9 expression levels and the expression profiles of cell surface markers as well as chromosomal alterations. These results provide direct evidence that the expression levels of AQP9, rather than other biomarkers such as cell surface markers and chromosomal alterations, correlate closely with the sensitivity to ATO in both APL cell lines and primary blasts. These findings suggest that the AQP9 expression status of APL patients is a predictive marker for the successful outcome of ATO treatment, since AQP9 plays a pivotal role in various arsenite-mediated biological effects on normal and cancer cells. Moreover, flow cytometry may be a new convenient and valuable tool for analyzing the AQP9 status of APL patients compared to current methods such as western blotting.","['Iriyama, Noriyoshi', 'Yuan, Bo', 'Yoshino, Yuta', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Horikoshi, Akira', 'Aizawa, Shin', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Toyoda, Hiroo']","['Iriyama N', 'Yuan B', 'Yoshino Y', 'Hatta Y', 'Horikoshi A', 'Aizawa S', 'Takeuchi J', 'Toyoda H']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi Hospital, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130405,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aquaporins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Oxides/*pharmacology']",,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2012/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2388 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Jun;29(6):2362-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2388.

Furthermore, late effects of therapy cause significant morbidity for many survivors. Novel therapies are therefore desperately needed. Early-phase paediatric trials of several new agents such as clofarabine, sorafenib and gemtuzumab ozogamicin have shown encouraging results in recent years. Due to the relatively low incidence of AML in childhood, the success of paediatric early-phase clinical trials is largely dependent upon collaborative clinical trial design by international cooperative study groups.

Coculture of mesenchymal stem (MSC)/progenitor cells and wild-type bone marrow (BM) cells reveals that p190-B(-/-) MSCs are dysfunctional in supporting hematopoiesis owing to impaired Wnt signaling. Furthermore, p190-B loss causes alteration in BM niche composition, including abnormal colony-forming unit (CFU)-fibroblast, CFU-adipocyte and CFU-osteoblast numbers. This is due to altered MSC lineage fate specification to osteoblast and adipocyte lineages.

Therefore, they are important targets for novel therapeutics, particularly Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 mimetics. Bcl-B (BCL-2-like protein-10) is a relatively understudied member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Its physiological function is unknown, but it has been proven to have an anti-apoptotic activity and to act as a tumor promoter in mice. In human, high Bcl-B protein expression levels correlate with poor prognosis in various carcinomas and predict treatment resistance in acute myeloid leukemia. We here report that protein expression level and anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-B are dictated by its ubiquitination. We demonstrate that Bcl-B is polyubiquitinated at steady state, in a unique loop between the BH1 and BH2 domains. Mutagenesis identified lysine (K)128 as an acceptor site for polyubiquitin chains, and K119 and K120, but not K181, as potential ubiquitination sites. Mass spectrometry confirmed K128 as a ubiquitination site and defined the polyubiquitin chains as K48-linked, which was confirmed by linkage-specific antibodies. Accordingly, Bcl-B proved to be an instable protein that is subject to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation at steady state. At equal mRNA expression, protein expression of a lysineless, nonubiquitinated Bcl-B mutant was fivefold higher than that of wild-type Bcl-B, demonstrating that ubiquitination is a key determinant for Bcl-B protein expression levels. Ubiquitination controlled the anti-apoptotic capacity of Bcl-B, in response to a variety of conventional and novel anti-cancer drugs. Certain anti-cancer drugs, known to reduce Mcl-1 protein levels, likewise downregulated Bcl-B. Together, these data demonstrate that polyubiquitination and proteasomal turnover dictate the expression level and anti-apoptotic capacity of Bcl-B.","['van de Kooij, B', 'Rooswinkel, R W', 'Kok, F', 'Herrebout, M', 'de Vries, E', 'Paauwe, M', 'Janssen, G M C', 'van Veelen, P A', 'Borst, J']","['van de Kooij B', 'Rooswinkel RW', 'Kok F', 'Herrebout M', 'de Vries E', 'Paauwe M', 'Janssen GM', 'van Veelen PA', 'Borst J']","['Division of Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130408,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Polyubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitination/drug effects']",PMC3898306,2013/04/09 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2012/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201399 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.99 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Nov 28;32(48):5439-48. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.99.

Multiple cellular activities, including DNA repair, alternative lengthening of telomeres, transcriptional control, apoptosis and senescence, are regulated by PML and its featured subcellular structure, the PML nuclear body. In correspondence with its role in many important life processes, PML mediates several complex downstream signaling pathways. The determinant function of PML in tumorigenesis and cancer progression raises the interest in its involvement in cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of cancer cells that share properties with stem cells and are critical for tumor propagation. Recently, there are exciting discoveries concerning the requirement of PML in CSC maintenance. Growing evidences strongly suggest a positive role of PML in regulating CSCs in both hematopoietic cancers and solid tumors, whereas the underlying mechanisms may be different and remain elusive.

It is frequently overexpressed and/or constitutively activated in non-small cell lung cancer and thus is considered as a major cause of this disease. Recently, EGFR has been found in the nucleus where the nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) can function as a transcription factor activating the transcription of genes such as cyclin D1 gene (CCND1), which is essential for cell proliferation. Nevertheless, how nEGFR's transcriptional activity is regulated remains unclear. Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a tumor suppressor, which is lost in various cancers including lung cancer. However, the role of PML in the suppression of lung cancer growth is still unclear. When we investigated the role of PML in the regulation of lung cancer cell growth, we found that PML isoform IV (PMLIV) preferentially represses the growth of lung cancer cells bearing constitutively active EGFR. Besides, when growing in the EGFR activating conditions, the growth of EGFR wild-type bearing A549 cells has been repressed by PMLIV overexpression. We also found that PMLIV can interact physically with nEGFR and represses the transcription of nEGFR target genes. We showed that PMLIV is recruited by nEGFR to the target promoters and reduces the promoter histone acetylation level via HDAC1. Together, our results suggest that PMLIV interacts with nEGFR upon EGFR activation and represses the transcription of nEGFR target genes such as CCND1 and thus leading to inhibition of the lung cancer cell growth.","['Kuo, Hong-Yi', 'Chen, Yi-Chen', 'Chang, Hsiang-Yi', 'Jeng, Jen-Chong', 'Lin, Erh-Hsuan', 'Pan, Chih-Ming', 'Chang, Yu-Wei', 'Wang, Mong-Lien', 'Chou, Yu-Ting', 'Shih, Hsiu-Ming', 'Wu, Cheng-Wen']","['Kuo HY', 'Chen YC', 'Chang HY', 'Jeng JC', 'Lin EH', 'Pan CM', 'Chang YW', 'Wang ML', 'Chou YT', 'Shih HM', 'Wu CW']","['Institute of Biomedical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130404,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/04/09 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['bgt109 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgt109 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Aug;34(8):1708-16. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgt109.

A total of 3308 patients with acute leukemia in non-remission were analyzed. The risk of NRM decreased over the three periods, and the hazard ratios (HRs) in 2001-2004 and 2005-2008 compared with 1997-2000 were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.70-1.06; P=0.16) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.53-0.80; P<0.01), respectively.

We found that a decrease in the incidences of death due to GVHD and infection contributed to the reduction in NRM, to which high-resolution donor-recipient HLA matching and other improvements may have contributed.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest a favorable 'virus-versus-leukemia' effect from reactivating CMV, reducing relapse of AML after SCT. We studied the relationship of CMV reactivation with leukemic relapse in 110 patients with CML receiving HLA-identical sibling SCT between 1993 and 2008. Of these, 79 (72%) were in chronic phase, 5 in second chronic phase, 17 in accelerated phase and 9 in blast phase. A total of 97 patients (88%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen, 97 received 4-log ex vivo T cell-depleted grafts and 13 received T-replete grafts. CMV reactivation before day 100 was observed in 72 patients (65.5%). At a median follow-up of 6.2 years, CMV reactivation < day 100 as a time-dependent covariate was an independent factor associated with decreased relapse.

Dose intensity across RIC regimens vary and may affect treatment outcomes. In this retrospective analysis, we investigated the effect of i.v. busulfan dosing (total dose 3.2 mg/kg versus 6.4 mg/kg) in RIC regimens that combined fludarabine and busulfan on outcomes in patients who were undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A total of 217 consecutive patients with MDS or AML underwent first busulfan and fludarabine RIC peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from well-matched related or unrelated donors at our institutions between 2004 and 2009. Of the 217 patients, 135 patients received Bu1 (3.2 mg/kg of busulfan) and 82 patients received Bu2 (6.4 mg/kg of busulfan), both with daily fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day for 4 days). The choice of RIC regimen was based on temporal institutional standard, enrollment on protocols, and physician choice. Patients had similar characteristics with a few notable differences: Patients who received Bu1 were younger (median age 61 versus 64 years, P < . 001), received more single-antigen mismatched unrelated grafts (14.1% versus 1.2%, P < . 001), received more sirolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens (63% versus 45%, P < .0001), received less antithymocyte globulin for GVHD prophylaxis (0% versus 22%, P < .001), and had less enrollment on a clinical trial that used prophylactic rituximab for the prevention of chronic GVHD (2.2% versus 11.0%, P = .011). Clinical disease status was similar between the groups. Median follow-up for survivors was 4.4 years for Bu1 and 3.2 years for Bu2. Because of the differences in characteristics, the 2 groups were compared with the adjustment of a propensity score that predicted Bu2 to account for measured differences. The day +200 cumulative incidence rates of grades II to IV acute GVHD (Bu1, 17%, versus Bu2, 8.5%; hazard ratio [HR], .56; 95% confidence interval [CI], .22 to 1.41; P = .22) or grades III to IV acute GVHD (Bu1, 6.7%, versus Bu2, 4.9%) were not different. The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was not significantly different between Bu1 and Bu2 (41.5% versus 28%, respectively; HR, .70; CI, .42 to 1.17; P = .09). Two-year nonrelapse mortality rates were similar for Bu1 and Bu2 (8.9% versus 9.8%, respectively; HR, .80; CI, .29 to 2.21; P = .67). Two-year progression-free survival and overall survival were also similar between Bu1 and Bu2 (progression-free survival: 40.6% versus 39.3%, respectively; HR, .82; CI, .57 to 1.30; P = .33; and overall survival: 47.4% versus 48.8%, respectively; HR, .96; CI, .64 to 1.44; P = .85). Subset analysis defined by clinical disease and cytogenetic risk with the propensity risk score applied suggest that in patients with high clinical disease risk and nonadverse cytogenetics, the higher dose busulfan RIC regimen may be of marginal benefit (2-year progression-free survival: HR, .54; CI, .29 to 1.03; P = .062). For the majority of patients with MDS or AML undergoing busulfan and fludarabine RIC peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, however, the dose of busulfan (3.2 mg/kg versus 6.4 mg/kg) is not associated with significant differences in overall outcomes.","['Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Coughlin, Erin', 'Kennedy, Kevin F', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Armand, Philippe', 'Attar, Eyal C', 'Ballen, Karen K', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Dey, Bimalangshu R', 'Koreth, John', 'McAfee, Steven L', 'Spitzer, Thomas R', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Ho, Vincent T']","['Chen YB', 'Coughlin E', 'Kennedy KF', 'Alyea EP', 'Armand P', 'Attar EC', 'Ballen KK', 'Cutler C', 'Dey BR', 'Koreth J', 'McAfee SL', 'Spitzer TR', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ho VT']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. ychen6@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130402,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Aged', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(13)00142-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.03.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jun;19(6):981-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.03.016.

Enforced expression of ectopic Mcl-1 significantly attenuated the effects of BKM120 alone or in combination with TRAIL on induction of apoptosis. Thus Mcl-1 downregulation contributes to BKM120-induced apoptosis or enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we have demonstrated that BMK120 decreases Mcl-1 levels through facilitating its degradation involving a GSK3/FBXW7-dependent mechanism.","['Ren, Hui', 'Zhao, Liqun', 'Li, Yikun', 'Yue, Ping', 'Deng, Xingming', 'Owonikoko, Taofeek K', 'Chen, Mingwei', 'Khuri, Fadlo R', 'Sun, Shi-Yong']","['Ren H', 'Zhao L', 'Li Y', 'Yue P', 'Deng X', 'Owonikoko TK', 'Chen M', 'Khuri FR', 'Sun SY']","[""Department of Respiration, First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130402,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3750077,2013/04/09 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(13)00274-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2013.03.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2013 Sep 28;338(2):229-38. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2013.03.032.

Like hMSCs, hMAPCs inhibit T-cell proliferation induced by alloantigens. In this study, we tested the interaction between hMAPCs and natural killer (NK) cells. We assessed the susceptibility of hMAPCs to NK cell-mediated lysis and the immunomodulation of hMAPCs on NK cell function during IL-2-driven stimulation and the cytolytic effector phase. Human MAPCs express the ligands PVR and ULBP-2/5/6, which are recognized by activating NK cell receptors. However, they also express MHC class I molecules, which induce inhibitory signals in NK cells. Freshly isolated NK cells at different effector:target ratios did not kill hMAPCs as assessed by an MTT and (51)Cr-release assay, while hMAPCs impaired the cytotoxic activity of resting NK cells against the NK-sensitive K562 leukemia cell line. By contrast, IL-2-stimulated NK cells were capable of killing hMAPCs, and preactivated NK cells were not influenced during their cytotoxic effector function against K562 cells by hMAPCs. When added during the 6-day preactivation phase with IL-2, hMAPCs dose-dependently reduced NK cell proliferation in an IDO-dependent manner, but they did not influence the induction of cytotoxic capacity by IL-2. This study indicates that human MAPCs mutually interact with NK cells.","['Jacobs, Sandra A', 'Plessers, Jeroen', 'Pinxteren, Jef', 'Roobrouck, Valerie D', 'Verfaillie, Catherine M', 'Van Gool, Stefaan W']","['Jacobs SA', 'Plessers J', 'Pinxteren J', 'Roobrouck VD', 'Verfaillie CM', 'Van Gool SW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Laboratory of Pediatric Immunology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology']",,2013/04/09 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3727/096368913X665585 [doi]', 'content-cog_09636897_ct0955jacobs [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2014;23(9):1099-110. doi: 10.3727/096368913X665585.,9,,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are 4 possible causes for this complication. First, antibodies present in the recipient destroy donor cells. Second, donor red cell antibodies at the time of stem cell infusion are transferred to the recipient. Third, sometimes, engrafted donor lymphocytes cause active production of red cell antibodies. Fourth, another cause of hemolysis after allogeneic HSCT is autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). It is thought to be due to antibodies produced by the donor's immune system against antigens on red cells of donor origin. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia after allogeneic HSCT is rare, it is still not well characterized, and it represents a life-threatening situation. We describe 2 patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with intensive chemotherapy and umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation (UCBT). One patient developed AIHA at day +182 and the other at day +212 after receiving UCBT. Patients received 5 and 7 line treatment options, respectively, including continuous corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, splenectomy, cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange, rituximab, bortezomib, and eculizumab. However, both patients died because of massive hemolysis after 85 and 106 days of intensive treatment, respectively. These cases reflect the extreme difficulty in the therapeutic management of patients with AIHA following UCBT. After an extensive review of the literature, the exact physiopathologic mechanisms of AIHA after allogeneic HSCT in general, and after UCBT in particular, and therefore an effective treatment remain unknown.","['Rovira, Jordina', 'Cid, Joan', 'Gutierrez-Garcia, Gonzalo', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Fernandez-Aviles, Francesc', 'Rosinol, Laura', 'Martinez, Carmen', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Urbano, Alvaro', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Lozano, Miguel']","['Rovira J', 'Cid J', 'Gutierrez-Garcia G', 'Pereira A', 'Fernandez-Aviles F', 'Rosinol L', 'Martinez C', 'Carreras E', 'Urbano A', 'Rovira M', 'Lozano M']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20130404,United States,Transfus Med Rev,Transfusion medicine reviews,8709027,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*etiology/*mortality', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2013/04/09 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-7963(13)00008-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tmrv.2013.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Med Rev. 2013 Jul;27(3):166-70. doi: 10.1016/j.tmrv.2013.02.004.

In coding sequences, MSI leads to frameshift mutations (FSMs) and the production of C-terminally altered proteins which are foreign to the immune system. Here, we wondered whether these frame-shifted peptide (FSP) sequences represent tumour-specific antigens also for MSI(+) leukaemia and lymphomas (L/L). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 coding region microsatellites were examined in MSI(+) L/L cell lines for the presence of FSMs. Thereafter, recognition of MSI(+) cells by established FSP-specific CD8(+) T cell lines was quantified using interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. In each experiment, MSI(+) L/L cell lines and T2 targets exogenously loaded with the cognate peptide (=internal control) were employed. Supplementary, lytic activity towards tumour cells was analysed by standard chromium release assay ((51)Cr). RESULTS: Mutational profiling of 33 coding microsatellite loci in nine MSI(+) L/L cell lines revealed instability in at least nine microsatellites. In each cell line, a distinct mutational profile was observed. Only three of the 33 loci were stable. FSP-specific and human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2)-restricted T cells specifically recognised MSI(+) L/L cells endogenously expressing TGFbetaRII(-1), Caspase 5 (-1) and MSH3 (-1) in ELISpot assays. Moreover, specific killing of Caspase 5 (-1) and MSH3 (-1) expressing L/L cell lines was achieved in functional cytotoxicity assays. CONCLUSION: Data presented here expand the importance of FSPs as shared and general tumour-specific antigens. Consequently, they open new avenues for specific immunotherapies not only for solid but also for MSI(+) haematological malignancies.","['Maletzki, Claudia', 'Schmidt, Fabian', 'Dirks, Wilhelm G', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Linnebacher, Michael']","['Maletzki C', 'Schmidt F', 'Dirks WG', 'Schmitt M', 'Linnebacher M']","['Division of Molecular Oncology and Immunotherapy, Department of General Surgery, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology and Immunotherapy, Department of General Surgery, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', 'German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy, Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology and Immunotherapy, Department of General Surgery, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.

Among the various inhibitors developed so far, flavopiridol proved to be a potential antitumor drug in the phase-III clinical trial for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we described a theoretical assessment for the discovery of new drugs or drug targets in CDK7 protein owing to the changes caused by deleterious nsSNPs. METHODS: Three nsSNPs (I63R, H135R, and T285M) were predicted to have functional impact on protein function by SIFT, PolyPhen2, I-Mutant3, PANTHER, SNPs&GO, PhD-SNP, and screening for non-acceptable polymorphisms (SNAP). Furthermore, we analyzed the native and proposed mutant models in atomic level 10 ns simulation using the molecular dynamics (MD) approach. Finally, with the aid of Autodock 4.0 and PatchDock, we analyzed the binding efficacy of flavopiridol with CDK7 protein with respect to the deleterious mutations. RESULTS: By comparing the results of all seven prediction tools, three nsSNPs (I63R, H135R, and T285M) were predicted to have functional impact on the protein function. The results of protein stability analysis inferred that I63R and H135R exhibited less deviation in root mean square deviation in comparison with the native and T285M protein. The flexibility of all the three mutant models of CDK7 protein is diverse in comparison with the native protein. Following to that, docking study revealed the change in the active site residues and decrease in the binding affinity of flavopiridol with mutant proteins. CONCLUSION: This theoretical approach is entirely based on computational methods, which has the ability to identify the disease-related SNPs in complex disorders by contrasting their costs and capabilities with those of the experimental methods. The identification of disease related SNPs by computational methods has the potential to create personalized tools for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases. LAY ABSTRACT: Cell cycle regulatory protein, CDK7, is linked with DNA repair mechanism which can contribute to cancer risk. The main aim of this study is to extrapolate the relationship between the nsSNPs and their effects in drug-binding capability. In this work, we propose a new methodology which (1) efficiently identified the deleterious nsSNPs that tend to have functional effect on protein function upon mutation by computational tools, (2) analyze d the native protein and proposed mutant models in atomic level using MD approach, and (3) investigated the protein-ligand interactions to analyze the binding ability by docking analysis. This theoretical approach is entirely based on computational methods, which has the ability to identify the disease-related SNPs in complex disorders by contrasting their costs and capabilities with those of the experimental methods. Overall, this approach has the potential to create personalized tools for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases.","['George Priya Doss, C', 'Nagasundaram, N', 'Chakraborty, Chiranjib', 'Chen, Luonan', 'Zhu, Hailong']","['George Priya Doss C', 'Nagasundaram N', 'Chakraborty C', 'Chen L', 'Zhu H']","['Medical Biotechnology Division, Centre for Nanobiotechnology, School of Biosciences and Technology, VIT University, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu 632014, India. georgecp77@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130405,England,Hum Genomics,Human genomics,101202210,IM,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Piperidines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Software', 'Static Electricity', 'Thermodynamics']",PMC3726351,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-7364-7-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-7364-7-10 [doi]']",epublish,Hum Genomics. 2013 Apr 5;7:10. doi: 10.1186/1479-7364-7-10.,,,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article discusses the role of the microenvironment in the context of efforts to develop novel therapeutics that target the biology of CLL.","['Herishanu, Yair', 'Katz, Ben-Zion', 'Lipsky, Andrew', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Herishanu Y', 'Katz BZ', 'Lipsky A', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Institute, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv 64239, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",,United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/immunology']",PMC3660068,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0889-8588(13)00003-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.hoc.2013.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2013 Apr;27(2):173-206. doi: 10.1016/j.hoc.2013.01.002.,2,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,['ZIA HL002346-08/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS458497'],['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,

We found that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with critically short telomeres (Tert(-/-) ESCs) initiated normal differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal but, unlike control ESCs, failed to maintain stable differentiation when LIF was reintroduced to the growth medium. Tert(-/-) ESCs expressed higher levels of Nanog and, overall, had decreased genomic CpG methylation levels, which included the promoters of Oct4 and Nanog. This unstable differentiation phenotype could be rescued by telomere elongation via reintroduction of Tert, via suppression of Nanog by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown, or via enforced expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3b.

Although strategies are being devised to inhibit DUX4 activity in FSHD, there is little known about the normal function of this protein. Expression of DUX4 has been reported in pluripotent cells and testis. To test the idea that DUX4 may be involved in initiating a germ lineage program in pluripotent cells, we interrogated the effect of expressing the human DUX4 gene at different stages during in vitro differentiation of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. We find that expression of even low levels of DUX4 is incompatible with pluripotency: DUX4-expressing ES cells downregulate pluripotency markers and rapidly differentiate even in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Transcriptional profiling revealed unexpectedly that DUX4 induced a neurectodermal program. Embryoid bodies exposed to a pulse of DUX4 expression displayed severely inhibited mesodermal differentiation, but acquired neurogenic potential. In a serum-containing medium in which neurogenic differentiation is minimal, DUX4 expression served as a neural-inducing factor, enabling the differentiation of Tuj1+ neurites. These data suggest that besides effects in muscle and germ cells, the involvement of DUX4 in neurogenesis should be considered as anti-DUX4 therapies are developed.","['Dandapat, Abhijit', 'Hartweck, Lynn M', 'Bosnakovski, Darko', 'Kyba, Michael']","['Dandapat A', 'Hartweck LM', 'Bosnakovski D', 'Kyba M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Lillehei Heart Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Embryoid Bodies/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral/genetics/metabolism', 'Neurogenesis/*genetics']",PMC3749711,2013/04/09 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2012.0643 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Sep 1;22(17):2440-8. doi: 10.1089/scd.2012.0643.

It is the first targeted therapy to be developed for the treatment of lymphoma which has been widely adopted. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the use of rituximab in NHL, mainly concentrating on diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), with a brief discussion about use in other types of NHL including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The use of rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been recently published in this journal by Robak (Robak T. Rituximab for chronic lymphocytic Leukemia. Expert Opin Biol. Ther. 2012;12(4):503-15). Non hematological indications for rituximab are also not discussed. A Pubmed search was conducted using key words of rituximab, DLBCL, FL, MCL, Burkitt's lymphoma and MALToma. Papers shortlisted for review included randomized control trials and scientific papers discussing CD20. EXPERT OPINION: In conclusion this paper has critically evaluated the use of rituximab in the treatment mainly of DLBCL, FL and MCL both at diagnosis and relapsed disease, and briefly discuses its use in other subtypes of lymphoma. Rituximab has significantly improved the outcome of patients with B cell NHL, in particular those with DLBCL and FL. Patients usually tolerate the treatment well, and studies have shown it to be a cost effective treatment.","['Griffin, Morag Meriel', 'Morley, Nick']","['Griffin MM', 'Morley N']","['Royal Hallamshire Hosptial, Department of Haematology, H floor, Glossop road, S10 2JF, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Papillary, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab']",,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2013.786698 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2013 May;13(5):803-11. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2013.786698.,5,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, recently we have examined the potential role of Glutaminyl Cyclases (QC and isoQC), and their inhibitors, in the maturation of chemokines, for example, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1, CCL2), to generate their bioactive conformation. Catalysis by isoQC leads to the formation of an N-terminal pyroglutamate residue protecting CCL2 against degradation by aminopeptidases. This is of importance because truncated forms possess a reduced potential to attract immune cells. Since liver inflammation is characterized by the up-regulation of different chemokine pathways, and within this CCL2 is known to be a prominent example, we hypothesised that application of QC/isoQC inhibitors may alleviate liver inflammation by destabilizing CCL2. Therefore, we investigated the role of QC/isoQC inhibition, in comparison with the angiotensin receptor blocker Telmisartan, during development of pathology in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Application of a QC/isoQC inhibitor led to a significant reduction in circulating alanine aminotransferase and NAFLD activity score accompanied by an inhibitory effect on hepatocyte ballooning. Further analysis revealed a specific reduction of inflammation by decreasing the number of F4/80-positive macrophages, which is in agreement with the proposed CCL2-related mechanism of action of QC/isoQC inhibitors. Finally, QC/isoQC inhibitor application attenuated liver fibrosis as characterized by reduced collagen deposition in the liver parenchyma. Thus in conclusion, QC/isoQC inhibitors are a promising novel class of anti-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis drugs which have a comparable disease-modifying effect to that of Telmisartan, which is probably mediated via specific interference with a comparable monocyte/macrophage infiltration that occurs under inflammatory conditions.","['Cynis, Holger', 'Kehlen, Astrid', 'Haegele, Monique', 'Hoffmann, Torsten', 'Heiser, Ulrich', 'Fujii, Masato', 'Shibazaki, Yuichiro', 'Yoneyama, Hiroyuki', 'Schilling, Stephan', 'Demuth, Hans-Ulrich']","['Cynis H', 'Kehlen A', 'Haegele M', 'Hoffmann T', 'Heiser U', 'Fujii M', 'Shibazaki Y', 'Yoneyama H', 'Schilling S', 'Demuth HU']","['Probiodrug AG, Halle, Germany. holger.cynis@me.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130408,England,Int J Exp Pathol,International journal of experimental pathology,9014042,IM,"['Aminoacyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL2/immunology/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Fatty Liver/drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', '*Hepatitis/drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease', 'Telmisartan']",PMC3664967,2013/04/09 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2013/04/09 06:00'],"['2012/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/iep.12020 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Exp Pathol. 2013 Jun;94(3):217-25. doi: 10.1111/iep.12020.

Few data have been reported regarding other bands on 6q involved by cytogenetic alterations in CLL. The cytogenetic study was performed in nuclei and metaphases obtained after stimulation with a combination of CpG-oligonucleotide DSP30 and interleukin-2. Four bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones mapping regions in bands 6q16, 6q23, 6q25, 6q27 were used as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization in 107 CLL cases in order to analyze the occurrence and localization of 6q aberrations. We identified 11 cases (10.2%) with 6q deletion of 107 patients studied with CLL. The trends of survival curves and the treatment-free intervals (TFI) of patients with deletion suggest a better outcome than the other cytogenetic risk groups. We observed two subgroups with 6q deletion as the sole anomaly: two cases with 6q16 deletion, and three cases with 6q25.2-27 deletion. There were differences of age, stage, and TFI between both subgroups. By using BAC probes, we observed that 6q deletion has a higher frequency in CLL and is linked with a good prognosis. In addition, it was observed that the deletion in 6q16 appears to be the most frequent and, if present as the only abnormality, it could be associated with a most widespread disease.","['Dalsass, Alessia', 'Mestichelli, Francesca', 'Ruggieri, Miriana', 'Gaspari, Paola', 'Pezzoni, Valerio', 'Vagnoni, Davide', 'Angelini, Mario', 'Angelini, Stefano', 'Bigazzi, Catia', 'Falcioni, Sadia', 'Troiani, Emanuela', 'Alesiani, Francesco', 'Catarini, Massimo', 'Attolico, Immacolata', 'Scortechini, Ilaria', 'Discepoli, Giancarlo', 'Galieni, Piero']","['Dalsass A', 'Mestichelli F', 'Ruggieri M', 'Gaspari P', 'Pezzoni V', 'Vagnoni D', 'Angelini M', 'Angelini S', 'Bigazzi C', 'Falcioni S', 'Troiani E', 'Alesiani F', 'Catarini M', 'Attolico I', 'Scortechini I', 'Discepoli G', 'Galieni P']","['SC Ematologia Ospedale C.

Studies have demonstrated a supportive role of endothelial cells (ECs) in normal hematopoiesis. Here we show that similar intercellular relationships exist in leukemia. We demonstrate that leukemia cells themselves initiate these interactions by directly modulating the behavior of resting ECs through the induction of EC activation. In this inflammatory state, activated ECs induce the adhesion of a sub-set of leukemia cells through the cell adhesion molecule E-selectin. These adherent leukemia cells are sequestered in a quiescent state and are unaffected by chemotherapy. The ability of adherent cells to later detach and again become proliferative following exposure to chemotherapy suggests a role of this process in relapse. Interestingly, differing leukemia subtypes modulate this process to varying degrees, which may explain the varied response of AML patients to chemotherapy and relapse rates. Finally, because leukemia cells themselves induce EC activation, we postulate a positive-feedback loop in leukemia that exists to support the growth and relapse of the disease. Together, the data defines a new mechanism describing how ECs and leukemia cells interact during leukemogenesis, which could be used to develop novel treatments for those with AML.","['Pezeshkian, Bahareh', 'Donnelly, Christopher', 'Tamburo, Kelley', 'Geddes, Timothy', 'Madlambayan, Gerard J']","['Pezeshkian B', 'Donnelly C', 'Tamburo K', 'Geddes T', 'Madlambayan GJ']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130401,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'E-Selectin/metabolism', 'Feedback, Physiological/drug effects', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Recurrence', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC3613371,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060823 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-35297 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60823. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060823.

Several prognostic factors such as the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes (IGHV) mutation status are linked to the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, supporting a role for triggering the BCR in vivo in the pathogenesis. The miRNA profile upon stimulation and correlation with IGHV mutation status is however unknown. To evaluate the transcriptional response of peripheral blood CLL cells upon BCR stimulation in vitro, miRNA and mRNA expression was measured using hybridization arrays and qPCR. We found both IGHV mutated and unmutated CLL cells to respond with increased expression of MYC and other genes associated with BCR activation, and a phenotype of cell cycle progression. Genome-wide expression studies showed hsa-miR-132-3p/hsa-miR-212 miRNA cluster induction associated with a set of downregulated genes, enriched for genes modulated by BCR activation and amplified by Myc. We conclude that BCR triggering of CLL cells induces a transcriptional response of genes associated with BCR activation, enhanced cell cycle entry and progression and suggest that part of the transcriptional profiles linked to IGHV mutation status observed in isolated peripheral blood are not cell intrinsic but rather secondary to in vivo BCR stimulation.","['Pede, Valerie', 'Rombout, Ans', 'Vermeire, Jolien', 'Naessens, Evelien', 'Mestdagh, Pieter', 'Robberecht, Nore', 'Vanderstraeten, Hanne', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Vandesompele, Jo', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Verhasselt, Bruno']","['Pede V', 'Rombout A', 'Vermeire J', 'Naessens E', 'Mestdagh P', 'Robberecht N', 'Vanderstraeten H', 'Van Roy N', 'Vandesompele J', 'Speleman F', 'Philippe J', 'Verhasselt B']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130401,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/immunology', 'Multigene Family', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*agonists/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC3613353,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060275 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-35711 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60275. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060275.

Recent studies have shown that anthracyclines may induce toxicity in the vascular endothelium. This study was performed using brachial artery reactivity (BAR) to evaluate vascular endothelial function in ALL patients who were treated with anthracycline chemotherapy. METHODS: We included 21 children with ALL who received anthracycline chemotherapy and 20 healthy children. The cumulative dose of anthracyclines in the ALL patients was 142.5+/-18.2/m(2). The last anthracycline dose was administered to the patients 2 to 85 months prior to their examination using BAR. The diameter of the brachial artery was measured in both groups using echocardiography, and BAR was calculated as the percentage change in the arterial diameter after release of the cuff relative to the baseline vessel diameter. RESULTS: In the anthracycline-treated group, BAR was observed to be 3.4%+/-3.9%, which was significantly lower than that observed in the control group (12.1%+/-8.0%, P<0.05). The time elapsed after the last anthracycline treatment and the age at the time of treatment did not affect the change in BAR (P=0.06 and P=0.13, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results provided evidence that treatment of ALL patients with anthracycline results in endothelial dysfunction. A larger cohort study and a longer follow-up period will be required to clarify the relationship between endothelial dysfunction resulting from anthracycline treatment for childhood ALL and occurrence of cardiovascular diseases later in life.","['Jang, Woo Jung', 'Choi, Duk Yong', 'Jeon, In-Sang']","['Jang WJ', 'Choi DY', 'Jeon IS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130318,Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,PMC3611047,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/04/06 06:01,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2012/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2013.56.3.130 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2013 Mar;56(3):130-4. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2013.56.3.130.

It can be sexually transmitted and is highly prevalent in Central and South America. AIM: To study HTLV-I/IIprevalence in serum samples obtained from two Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) clinics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred serum samples were randomly chosen from two reference STD centers of Santiago. The presence of specific HTLV I/II antibodies was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The analyzed samples came from participants aged 14 to 70 years. Forty nine percent were women and 76% were heterosexual.

However, it has been suggested that outcomes (event-free and overall survival) for these patients are better when they are treated with pediatric-inspired therapeutic regimens. This has been attributed to increased dose and frequency of non-myelosuppressive therapy, earlier and more frequent central nervous system prophylaxis, and longer maintenance therapy. However, management by the treating oncologist and adherence by the patients are equally vital. Ultimately, the combination of improved treatment regimens and organizational management are required to improve outcomes of ALL in the AYA population.","['Lukenbill, Joshua', 'Advani, Anjali S']","['Lukenbill J', 'Advani AS']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-013-0159-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2013 Jun;8(2):91-7. doi: 10.1007/s11899-013-0159-0.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here a proapoptotic role for PTPL1 in PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, as its absence induces apoptosis resistance upon treatment with different drugs. In PC3 cells, PTPL1 silencing by small interfering RNA influences the expression levels of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1(S) proteins as well as final events in the apoptotic process such as activation of caspases and caspase-mediated cleavage of proteins like Mcl-1 or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. We have identified PKCdelta as an intermediary of PTPL1-mediated apoptotic signalling and that phosphorylation status of NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha is influenced by PTPL1 and PKCdelta. Furthermore, the loss of PTPL1 and PKCdelta expression in poorly differentiated, more aggressive human prostate cancers also indicate that their absence could be related to apoptosis resistance and tumour progression.","['Castilla, C', 'Chinchon, D', 'Medina, R', 'Torrubia, F J', 'Japon, M A', 'Saez, C']","['Castilla C', 'Chinchon D', 'Medina R', 'Torrubia FJ', 'Japon MA', 'Saez C']","['Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBiS), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Seville 41013, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130404,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3668626,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201390 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.90 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Apr 4;4:e576. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.90.,,,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TTC5 is a stress-inducible transcription cofactor known to interact directly with the histone acetyltransferase EP300 to augment the TP53 response. Knockdown (KD) of TTC5 induced apoptosis of both murine and human AML cells, with concomitant loss of clonogenic and leukemia-initiating potential; KD of EP300 elicited a similar phenotype. Consistent with the physical interaction of TTC5 and EP300, the onset of apoptosis following KD of either gene was preceded by reduced expression of BCL2 and increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes. Forced expression of BCL2 blocked apoptosis and partially rescued the clonogenic potential of AML cells following TTC5 KD. KD of both genes also led to the accumulation of MYC, an acetylation target of EP300, and the form of MYC that accumulated exhibited relative hypoacetylation at K148 and K157, residues targeted by EP300. In view of the ability of excess cellular MYC to sensitize cells to apoptosis, our data suggest a model whereby TTC5 and EP300 cooperate to prevent excessive accumulation of MYC in AML cells and their sensitization to cell death. They further reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for TTC5 in leukemic hematopoiesis.","['Lynch, J T', 'Somerville, T D D', 'Spencer, G J', 'Huang, X', 'Somervaille, T C P']","['Lynch JT', 'Somerville TD', 'Spencer GJ', 'Huang X', 'Somervaille TC']","['Cancer Research UK Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130404,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3641330,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013107 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.107 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Apr 4;4:e573. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.107.,,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (TTC5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",,,['C5759/A12328/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-apoptotic molecules physically interact and restrain pro-apoptotic family members preventing the induction of cell death. However, the specificity of the functional interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members remains unclear. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-2 interacting mediator of death (Bim) has a critical role in promoting the death of activated, effector T cells following viral infections. Although Bcl-2 is an important Bim antagonist in effector T cells, and Bcl-xL is not required for effector T-cell survival, the roles of other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) in regulating effector T-cell responses in vivo. We found, at the peak of the response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, that Mcl-1 expression was increased in activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Retroviral overexpression of Mcl-1-protected activated T cells from death, whereas deletion of Mcl-1 during the course of infection led to a massive loss of LCMV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, the co-deletion of Bim failed to prevent the loss of Mcl-1-deficient T cells. Furthermore, lck-driven overexpression of a Bcl-xL transgene only partially rescued Mcl-1-deficient effector T cells suggesting a lack of redundancy between the family members. In contrast, additional loss of Bax and Bak completely rescued Mcl-1-deficient effector T-cell number and function, without enhancing T-cell proliferation. These data suggest that Mcl-1 is critical for promoting effector T-cell responses, but does so by combating pro-apoptotic molecules beyond Bim.","['Tripathi, P', 'Koss, B', 'Opferman, J T', 'Hildeman, D A']","['Tripathi P', 'Koss B', 'Opferman JT', 'Hildeman DA']","[""Division of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130405,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/deficiency/physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/virology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/deficiency/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/deficiency/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/physiology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",PMC3705594,2013/04/06 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201325 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.25 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2013 Aug;20(8):998-1007. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.25.

In 131 AML patients receiving induction therapy, the presence of the three most frequent polymorphisms of NOD2 (Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg, Leu1007fsinsC) was analysed. SNP analyses by means of genomic PCR incorporating fluorescence-labelled probes with characteristic melting curves were performed using the LightCycler platform.

Furthermore, bloodstream cultures of AML patients carrying either a missense or a frameshift mutation of NOD2 were significantly more frequently tested positive concerning Streptococcus spp. In contrast, the presence of NOD2 polymorphisms had no impact on such important infectious complications as systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis, the rate of central venous catheter infections or the incidence of pneumonia including fungal infections. Our data represent one of the first reports investigating the impact of polymorphisms of the innate immune system on infectious complications in patients with neutropenia following chemotherapy.

The aim of this study was to determine the survival or toxicity of escalated doses of DNR in induction treatment of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are at least 15 years of age. For induction chemotherapy, all patients were given 90 mg/m(2)/day of DNR by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 24 h daily on days 1-3, 2 mg of vincristine IV push on days 1 and 8, and 60 mg/m(2)/day of prednisolone per oral (PO) on days 1-14 in conjunction with 4,000 units/m(2)/day of L-asparaginase intramuscular or subcutaneous on days 17-28. The median patient age was 32 years (range, 15-69). Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 169 (88.5 %) patients, while 4 died before CR was reached. Additionally, 11 patients died from leukemia progression, 4 had refractory disease, and 3 had follow-up loss. The median follow-up time was 697 days (range, 12-2,270). The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 49.3 %. The probabilities of disease-free survival and overall survival at 3 years were 46.1 and 43.1 %, respectively. The dose of DNR was 100 % of the target dose, and there were no additional specific toxicities. The results show that escalated doses of DNR in induction chemotherapy are similar with the standard dose in response and toxicities.

The small-molecule S1 is a BH3 mimetic and a triple inhibitor of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL. METHODS: The lethal dose 50 (LD(50)) values of S1 in five leukaemic cell lines and 41 newly diagnosed leukaemia samples were tested. The levels of Bcl-2 family members and phosphorylated Bcl-2 were semiquantitatively measured by western blotting. The interactions between Bcl-2 family members were tested by co-immunoprecipitation. The correlation between the LD(50) and expression levels of Bcl-2 family members, alone or in combination, was analysed. RESULTS: S1 exhibited variable sensitivity with LD(50) values ranging >2 logs in both established and primary leukaemic cells. The ratio of pBcl-2/(Bcl-2+Mcl-1) could predict the S1 response. Furthermore, we demonstrated that pBcl-2 antagonised S1 by sequestering the Bak and Bim proteins that were released from Mcl-1, andpBcl-2/Bak, pBcl-2/Bax and pBcl-2/Bim complexes cannot be disrupted by S1. CONCLUSION: A predictive index was obtained for the novel BH3 mimetic S1. The shift of proapoptotic proteins from being complexed with Mcl-1 to being complexed with pBcl-2 was revealed for the first time, which is the mechanism underlying the index value described herein.","['Zhang, Z', 'Liu, Y', 'Song, T', 'Xue, Z', 'Shen, X', 'Liang, F', 'Zhao, Y', 'Li, Z', 'Sheng, H']","['Zhang Z', 'Liu Y', 'Song T', 'Xue Z', 'Shen X', 'Liang F', 'Zhao Y', 'Li Z', 'Sheng H']","['State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China. zczhang@dlut.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130404,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Acenaphthenes/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3658527,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013152 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.152 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 May 14;108(9):1870-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.152.

The study was carried out to test the hypothesis of an increased AL incidence in children living close to HVOL of 225-400 kV (VHV-HVOL) and 63-150 kV (HV-HVOL). METHODS: The nationwide Geocap study included all the 2779 cases of childhood AL diagnosed in France over 2002-2007 and 30 000 contemporaneous population controls. The addresses at the time of inclusion were geocoded and precisely located around the whole HVOL network. RESULTS: Increased odds ratios (ORs) were observed for AL occurrence and living within 50 m of a VHV-HVOL (OR=1.7 (0.9-3.6)). In contrast, there was no association with living beyond that distance from a VHV-HVOL or within 50 m of a HV-HVOL. CONCLUSION: The present study, free from any participation bias, supports the previous international findings of an increase in AL incidence close to VHV-HVOL. In order to investigate for a potential role of ELF-MF in the results, ELF-MF at the residences close to HVOL are to be estimated, using models based on the annual current loads and local characteristics of the lines.","['Sermage-Faure, C', 'Demoury, C', 'Rudant, J', 'Goujon-Bellec, S', 'Guyot-Goubin, A', 'Deschamps, F', 'Hemon, D', 'Clavel, J']","['Sermage-Faure C', 'Demoury C', 'Rudant J', 'Goujon-Bellec S', 'Guyot-Goubin A', 'Deschamps F', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['Inserm, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), U1018, Environmental Epidemiology of Cancer Team, Villejuif F-94807, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130404,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Electric Power Supplies/adverse effects', 'Electricity/*adverse effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Geographic Mapping', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors']",PMC3658518,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013128 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.128 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 May 14;108(9):1899-906. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.128.

One of the consequences of JAK2(V617F) is genetic instability that could explain JAK2(V617F)-mediated MPN progression and heterogeneity. Here, we show that JAK2(V617F) induces the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment of a knock-in (KI) mouse model and in patients with JAK2(V617F) MPNs. JAK2(V617F)-dependent ROS elevation was partly mediated by an AKT-induced decrease in catalase expression and was accompanied by an increased number of 8-oxo-guanines and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, there was evidence for a mitotic recombination event in mice resulting in loss of heterozygosity of Jak2(V617F). Mice engrafted with 30% of Jak2(V617F) KI bone marrow (BM) cells developed a polycythemia vera-like disorder. Treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) substantially restored blood parameters and reduced damages to DNA. Furthermore, NAC induced a marked decrease in splenomegaly with reduction in the frequency of the Jak2(V617F)-positive hematopoietic progenitors in BM and spleen. Altogether, overproduction of ROS is a mediator of JAK2(V617F)-induced DNA damages that promote disease progression. Targeting ROS accumulation might prevent the development of JAK2(V617F) MPNs.","['Marty, C', 'Lacout, C', 'Droin, N', 'Le Couedic, J-P', 'Ribrag, V', 'Solary, E', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Villeval, J-L', 'Plo, I']","['Marty C', 'Lacout C', 'Droin N', 'Le Couedic JP', 'Ribrag V', 'Solary E', 'Vainchenker W', 'Villeval JL', 'Plo I']","['1] Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR1009, Laboratory of Excellence GR-Ex, Villejuif, France [2] INSERM U1009, PR1, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France [3] University Paris-Sud 11, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130405,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Janus Kinase 2/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2013/04/06 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013102 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.102 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Nov;27(11):2187-95. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.102.

Nevertheless, it is currently unknown whether their presence may differ in subsets of patients carrying stereotyped B-cell receptors and also exhibiting distinct prognoses. Here, we analyzed the mutation status of NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 in three subsets with particularly poor prognosis, that is, subset #1, #2 and #8, aiming to explore links between genetic aberrations and immune signaling. A remarkably higher frequency of SF3B1 mutations was revealed in subset #2 (44%) versus subset #1 and #8 (4.6% and 0%, respectively; P<0.001). In contrast, the frequency of NOTCH1 mutations in subset #2 was only 8%, lower than the frequency observed in either subset #1 or #8 (19% and 14%, respectively; P=0.04 for subset #1 versus #2). No associations were found for BIRC3 mutations that overall were rare. The apparent non-random association of certain mutations with stereotyped CLL subsets alludes to subset-biased acquisition of genomic aberrations, perhaps consistent with particular antigen/antibody interactions. These novel findings assist in unraveling specific mechanisms underlying clinical aggressiveness in poor-prognostic stereotyped subsets, with far-reaching implications for understanding their clonal evolution and implementing biologically oriented therapy.","['Strefford, J C', 'Sutton, L-A', 'Baliakas, P', 'Agathangelidis, A', 'Malcikova, J', 'Plevova, K', 'Scarfo, L', 'Davis, Z', 'Stalika, E', 'Cortese, D', 'Cahill, N', 'Pedersen, L B', 'di Celle, P F', 'Tzenou, T', 'Geisler, C', 'Panagiotidis, P', 'Langerak, A W', 'Chiorazzi, N', 'Pospisilova, S', 'Oscier, D', 'Davi, F', 'Belessi, C', 'Mansouri, L', 'Ghia, P', 'Stamatopoulos, K', 'Rosenquist, R']","['Strefford JC', 'Sutton LA', 'Baliakas P', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Malcikova J', 'Plevova K', 'Scarfo L', 'Davis Z', 'Stalika E', 'Cortese D', 'Cahill N', 'Pedersen LB', 'di Celle PF', 'Tzenou T', 'Geisler C', 'Panagiotidis P', 'Langerak AW', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Pospisilova S', 'Oscier D', 'Davi F', 'Belessi C', 'Mansouri L', 'Ghia P', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rosenquist R']","['Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130405,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/*genetics/mortality', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,2013/04/06 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201398 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.98 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Nov;27(11):2196-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.98.

These mutations can now be integrated within the framework of evolution theory to address the mechanisms of the disease. Several evidences indicate that the disease emerges in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) through the age-dependent accumulation of DNA damage, leading stochastically to a driver mutation that confers a competitive advantage to the cell. A mutation in TET2 gene could be one of these driver mutations provoking the emergence of clonality. After a long latency, secondary lesions, such as mutations in the SRSF2 gene, contribute to progression to full-blown malignancy, with abnormal differentiation. Additional mutations accumulate and branching arising mostly through mitotic recombination generates clonal heterogeneity. Modifications in the microenvironment probably affect this clonal dynamics, whereas epigenetic alterations, such as hypermethylation of the TIF1gamma gene promoter, may generate phenotypic diversification of otherwise clonal populations. The preserved although deregulated myeloid differentiation that characterizes CMML, with granulomonocyte expansion and various cytopenias, may depend on early clonal dominance in the hematopietic cell hierarchy. Progression to acute myeloid leukemia observed in 25-30% of the patients may arise from the massive expansion of a clone with novel genetic lesions, providing a high fitness to previously minor subclones when in chronic phase of the disease. This review discusses the various models of disease emergence and progression and how this recent knowledge could drive rational therapeutic strategies.","['Itzykson, R', 'Solary, E']","['Itzykson R', 'Solary E']","['Department of Hematology, Inserm UMR1009, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130405,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Clonal Evolution/*physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Mutation/physiology']",,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013100 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.100 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jul;27(7):1441-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.100.

The International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) examined the clinical relevance of this process in 1104 cases of locally diagnosed 'ET' and showed worse overall, leukemia-free and fibrosis-free survival, and a higher risk of bleeding in early/prefibrotic MF (n=180) vs WHO-defined ET (n=891). The risk of thrombosis was similar between the two entities and, in WHO-defined ET, was predicted by thrombosis history, older age, cardiovascular risk factors and JAK2V617F. A prognostic model based on these risk factors identified patient groups in ET with residual risk of thrombosis, despite treatment with conventional therapy. The main objectives of the current perspective are to underscore the prognostic importance of morphological confirmation in the diagnosis of ET and provide management recommendations, in both WHO-defined ET and early/prefibrotic MF, based on observations from the aforementioned IWG-MRT and other studies.

By birth, a vascular annulus stereotypically surrounded the keratin 15 negative (K15-) stem cells in the upper bulge and remained associated with the K15- upper bulge throughout the hair cycle. The angiogenic factor Egfl6 was expressed by the K15- bulge and was localized adjacent to the vascular annulus, which comprised post-capillary venules. Although denervation altered the phenotype of upper bulge stem cells, the vascular annulus persisted in surgically denervated mouse skin. The importance of the perivascular niche was further suggested by the fact that vascular annuli formed around the upper bulge of de novo-reconstituted hair follicles before their innervation. Together, these findings demonstrate that the upper bulge is associated with a perivascular niche during the establishment and maintenance of this specialized region of hair follicle stem cells.","['Xiao, Ying', 'Woo, Wei-Meng', 'Nagao, Keisuke', 'Li, Wenling', 'Terunuma, Atsushi', 'Mukouyama, Yoh-Suke', 'Oro, Anthony E', 'Vogel, Jonathan C', 'Brownell, Isaac']","['Xiao Y', 'Woo WM', 'Nagao K', 'Li W', 'Terunuma A', 'Mukouyama YS', 'Oro AE', 'Vogel JC', 'Brownell I']","['Dermatology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Program in Epithelial Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Center for Integrated Medical Research, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Neuro-Vascular Biology, Genetics and Developmental Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Dermatology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Neuro-Vascular Biology, Genetics and Developmental Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Program in Epithelial Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Dermatology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Dermatology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

A crystal structure of AGI-6780 complexed with IDH2/R140Q revealed that the inhibitor binds in an allosteric manner at the dimer interface. The results of steady-state enzymology analysis were consistent with allostery and slow-tight binding by AGI-6780. Treatment with AGI-6780 induced differentiation of TF-1 erythroleukemia and primary human acute myelogenous leukemia cells in vitro.

In turn, cytoplasmic actin polymerization can promote release of actin from megakaryocytic acute leukemia (MAL) protein for serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional activity. We found that formins polymerized actin inside the mammalian nucleus to drive serum-dependent MAL-SRF activity. Serum stimulated rapid assembly of actin filaments within the nucleus in a formin-dependent manner. The endogenous formin mDia was regulated with an optogenetic tool, which allowed for photoreactive release of nuclear formin autoinhibition. Activated mDia promoted rapid and reversible nuclear actin network assembly, subsequent MAL nuclear accumulation, and SRF activity.

This association is well recognized but available evidence does not answer clinically relevant issues in subjects without diabetes. METHODS: Thirty-five individuals without diabetes with a recent diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on high-dose glucocorticoid therapy were studied. Close systematic monitoring of fasting and postprandial glycemia and fasting insulin determinations, HOMA-insulin resistance and HOMA beta-cell function were performed. The primary objective was to define the incidence of secondary diabetes in patients treated with high-dose glucocorticoids. Secondary objectives were to specify the intensity, the moment it appears and the evolution of hyperglycemia, in addition to the risk factors, mechanisms and impact of continuous and cyclical glucocorticoids on the development of hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 38.4 +/- 18.7 years. The incidence of diabetes was 40.6% and was found after the first week; half the time it occurred between the second and fourth. Two-thirds spontaneously normalized by eight weeks. Continuous glucocorticoid administration had a higher incidence of fasting hyperglycemia (P = 0.003). Mean peak insulin levels were significantly higher in cases of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose prednisone for 2 to 3 months produced an elevated incidence of diabetes, usually with mild hyperglycemia occurring between the second and fourth week, normalizing spontaneously in all cases. Hyperglycemia was more frequent with continuous doses and occurred in cases with increased insulin resistance. The clinical and therapeutic characteristics of our participants, who were otherwise healthy, could represent the clinical setting of many patients with illness from other medical areas that might require high doses of GC for six to twelve weeks.","['Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Jose Gerardo', 'Mireles-Zavala, Leonor Guadalupe', 'Rodriguez-Gutierrez, Rene', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David', 'Lavalle-Gonzalez, Fernando Javier', 'Tamez-Perez, Hector Eloy', 'Gonzalez-Saldivar, Gerardo', 'Villarreal-Perez, Jesus Zacarias']","['Gonzalez-Gonzalez JG', 'Mireles-Zavala LG', 'Rodriguez-Gutierrez R', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Lavalle-Gonzalez FJ', 'Tamez-Perez HE', 'Gonzalez-Saldivar G', 'Villarreal-Perez JZ']","['Endocrinology Sevice, ""Dr. Jose E.

We used CD68 (a pan-macrophage marker) and CD163 (an M2 marker) to immunostain 58 ATLL samples. Statistical analyses showed that a high number of CD68(+) TAMs and an increased percentage of CD163(+) cells among the TAMs were associated with a worse clinical prognosis; multivariate analysis indicated that the percentage of CD163(+) cells was an independent prognostic factor. We also carried out in vitro coculture experiments with ATLL cell lines (ATN-1 and TL-Mor) and monocyte-derived macrophages and found that direct coculture with M2 macrophages significantly increased BrdU incorporation into ATLL cell lines. A cytokine array analysis showed that macrophage-derived soluble factors including C5a, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, growth-related oncogene-alpha, CCL1/I-309, and interleukin-6 stimulated ATLL cell lines. CD163 expression in macrophages was strongly induced by direct contact with ATN-1 cells, and downregulation of CD163 in macrophages significantly suppressed growth of cocultured ATN-1 cells. These results suggest that interaction between M2 macrophages and lymphoma cells may be an appropriate target in treatment of patients with ATLL.","['Komohara, Yoshihiro', 'Niino, Daisuke', 'Saito, Yoichi', 'Ohnishi, Koji', 'Horlad, Hasita', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Takeya, Motohiro']","['Komohara Y', 'Niino D', 'Saito Y', 'Ohnishi K', 'Horlad H', 'Ohshima K', 'Takeya M']","['Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. ycomo@kumamoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL1/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL1/metabolism', 'Complement C5a/immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",PMC7657152,2013/04/06 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12167 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Jul;104(7):945-51. doi: 10.1111/cas.12167.

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the combination of barasertib and cytarabine (ara-C), a key agent for leukemia chemotherapy, on leukemic cells in vitro. Human leukemia HL-60 cells and HL-60/ara-C20 cells, a 20-fold ara-C-resistant variant, were used. The 50% growth inhibitory concentrations of an active metabolite of barasertib, barasertib-hydroxyquinazoline-pyrazol-aniline (Barasertib-HQPA), and ara-C were 51 nM and 300 nM for HL-60 cells and 70 nM and 5300 nM for HL-60/ara-C20 cells, respectively. Barasertib-HQPA induced polyploidy with a subsequent induction of sub-G1 phase apoptosis, indicating the M-phase specific cytotoxicity. Cells treated with the S-phase specific ara-C accumulated in S phase and subsequently died through apoptosis. When HL-60 cells were treated with barasertib-HQPA and ara-C in combination, a greater-than-additive apoptosis was induced. This enhancement was obtained when the cells were treated with barasertib-HQPA prior to ara-C (37.9% sub-G1) or with both concurrently (31.2% sub-G1), but not with ara-C prior to barasertib-HQPA (17.8% sub-G1). The combination effects were similarly obtained in HL-60/ara-C20 cells with 19.7% sub-G1 for barasertib-HQPA-->ara-C, 18.4% sub-G1 for both concurrently, and 13.8% sub-G1 for ara-C-->barasertib-HQPA, and another leukemic U937 cells with 25.4% sub-G1 for barasertib-HQPA-->ara-C, 28.2% sub-G1 for both concurrently, and 16.0% sub-G1 for ara-C-->barasertib-HQPA. Barasertib-HQPA inhibited aurora B autophosphorylation and histone H3 phosphorylation in all the cell lines. Barasertib-HQPA did not inhibit DNA synthesis, allowing ara-C incorporation into DNA for its cytotoxicity. Thus, barasertib-HQPA and ara-C provided a greater-than-additive cytotoxicity in leukemic cells in vitro.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Uzui, Kanako', 'Shigemi, Hiroko', 'Negoro, Eiju', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Uzui K', 'Shigemi H', 'Negoro E', 'Yoshida A', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan. tyamauch@u-fukui.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130512,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Organophosphates/administration & dosage', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage', 'U937 Cells']",PMC7657165,2013/04/06 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2013/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12164 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Jul;104(7):926-33. doi: 10.1111/cas.12164.

However, resistance to imatinib mediated by mutations in the BCR-ABL domain has become a major problem in the treatment of these patients. METHODS: In the present study, we examined the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in combination with an Aurora kinase inhibitor in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. RESULTS: We found the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat and/or pracinostat (SB939) induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Additionally, HDAC inhibitors reduced levels of Aurora A and B protein. An Aurora kinase inhibitor, tozasertib (VX-680), inhibited growth, promoted pro-apoptotic activity, reduced the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and Crk-L, and activated caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in BCR-ABL-positive cells. Moreover, after treatment with tozasertib, HDAC protein expression was decreased. Combination of vorinostat or pracinostat with tozasertib had a synergistic inhibitory effect on the proliferation of T315I cells. Phosphorylation of Crk-L decreased, and PARP activation increased after treatment with vorinostat or pracinostat and tozasertib. Moreover, combination of vorinostat or pracinostat and tozasertib significantly increased the extent of apoptosis in primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that combination of HDAC and Aurora inhibitors was highly effective against BCR-ABL-expressing cells.","['Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Tanaka, Yuko', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Maekawa, Taira', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Okabe S', 'Tauchi T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Kimura S', 'Maekawa T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. okabe@tokyho-med.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130404,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,PMC3635933,2013/04/06 06:00,2013/04/06 06:01,['2013/04/06 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-13-32 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-13-32 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2013 Apr 4;13(1):32. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-13-32.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic analysis of IL-10 SNPs at -819 and -592 was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Results revealed that the -819AA genotype frequencies and the -819A allele frequencies of AML group were higher than the controls (59.1% vs 40.9%; 75.6% vs 63.9%, respectively); there were remarkable differences in -819T/C and -592A/C gene distribution (P<0.05) and the TA haploid frequencies were higher in AML group (75.6% vs 63.9%, P<0.05). The IL-10 mRNA expression of AML patients and controls with different genotype was detected by Real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). IL-10 mRNA expression in incipient AML patients increased obviously compared with the non-tumor group and remission group (P<0.05). Further analysis suggested that the IL-10 mRNA expression of TA/TA genotype was the lowest and CC/CC genotype was the highest; the haploid TA and genotype TA/TA may be associated with AML.

This regimen has been employed across the globe in various iterations for many years with modest improvements in results yet this remains the first choice for the treatment of younger adults with AML.

Because relatively high rates of relapse are an important contributor to these poor outcomes, efforts have explored approaches to increase the cytotoxic effects of treatment. Relapse rates have been shown to improve with the addition of increased doses of total body irradiation (TBI) and/or the introduction of additional chemotherapy to a HCT conditioning regimen. However, the increase in TBI dose and/or additional chemotherapy has also been associated with a significant increase in life-threatening toxicities, resulting in no change in overall survival. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been employed as an adjunct to HCT where targeted delivery of radiation may allow for further escalation of therapy to reduce relapse with minimal toxicity. In this review we describe these efforts, including the benefits of escalating the dose of radiation to sites of hematologic disease prior to HCT, the various cellular targets for antibody-mediated delivery of radiation, as well as the rationale for incorporation of various radionuclides such as alpha emitters and beta emitters into the preparative regimen prior to HCT. Lastly, newer novel approaches such as pretargeted RIT (PRIT) are described as a method to further increase delivery of targeted radiation to hematological tissues while sparing noninvolved organs.","['Orozco, Johnnie J', 'Zeller, Jill', 'Pagel, John M']","['Orozco JJ', 'Zeller J', 'Pagel JM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3573428,2012/02/01 00:00,2012/02/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620711422265 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620711422265 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2012 Feb;3(1):5-16. doi: 10.1177/2040620711422265.,1,,,,,"['K08 CA095448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA044991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109663/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD45', 'antibodies', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'radioimmunotherapy']",,,,,,,

Induction of a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL), or graft-versus-tumor, effect through the use of donor leukocyte infusion (DLI), or donor lymphocyte infusion, has been remarkably successful for relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia. Unfortunately, response to DLI in other hematologic malignancies is much less common and depends on many factors including histology, pace and extent of relapse, and time from HSCT to relapse.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is thought to arise from, and be maintained by, leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which exhibit similar features to HSCs, including the abilities to self-renew and differentiate into non-self-renewing cells. Acquisition of stem-cell-like characteristics by the LSCs is likely mediated in part by molecular mechanisms that normally regulate HSC function. Thus, understanding the shared and unique aspects of the molecular regulation of these cell populations will be important to understanding the relationship between normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that act at the posttranscriptional level to regulate protein expression. Unfortunately, most investigations of the role of miRNAs in normal hematopoiesis have been restricted to studies of their effects on lineage commitment in progenitors and mature effector cell function, but not on HSCs. Recent studies have identified miRNAs that enhance HSC function, and an abundance of profiling studies using primary AML samples have identified dysregulated miRNAs that may target genes implicated in self-renewal (HOX genes, P53, and PTEN), thus providing a potential link between normal and malignant stem cells. While these studies as well as recent in vivo models of miRNA-induced leukemogenesis (e.g. miR-29a, miR-125b) suggest a role for miRNAs in the development of AML, future studies using serial transplantation of primary AML blasts, from both mouse models and primary human AML specimens, will be necessary to assess the roles of miRNAs in LSC biology.","['Chung, Stephen S', 'Hu, Wenhuo', 'Park, Christopher Y']","['Chung SS', 'Hu W', 'Park CY']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3573414,2011/10/01 00:00,2011/10/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620711410772 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620711410772 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2011 Oct;2(5):317-34. doi: 10.1177/2040620711410772.,5,,,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'experimental models of leukemia', 'hematopoiesis', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemia stem cell', 'microRNAs']",,,,,,,

Therefore, new treatment options are highly desirable. Chemically modified nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as nitric-oxide-donating acetylsalicylic acid (NO-ASA), have been described to possess antineoplastic capacity. Recently, we could demonstrate a potent apoptosis induction in primary CLL cells in vitro and tumor growth inhibition by para-NO-ASA in a xenograft mouse model. However, little is known about the impact of positional isomerism of NO-ASA on its antineoplastic capacity in CLL. METHODS: Primary CLL cells were treated with the meta-or para-isomer of NO-ASA at varying concentrations and durations. Viability was assessed flow cytometrically by annexin V-FITC/PI staining and by CellTiter-Glo luminescence cell viability assay. Caspase and PARP cleavage as well as involvement of beta-catenin/Lef-1 signaling was determined by immunoblotting. For caspase inhibition, BD ApoBlock was used. Nude mice were xenografted with JVM3 cells and treated with meta-NO-ASA, para-NO-ASA or vehicle control. RESULTS: The meta-isomer was entirely ineffective in inducing CLL cell apoptosis in concentrations up to 100 muM, while para-NO-ASA acted in the low micromolar range. meta-NO-ASA, in contrast to para-NO-ASA, did not alter caspase activity. While para-NO-ASA action involved inhibition of beta-catenin/Lef-1 signaling, meta-NO-ASA did not show any impact on this signaling pathway. Further, meta-NO-ASA did not significantly reduce tumor growth in a CLL xenograft mouse model, while para-NO-ASA was highly potent. CONCLUSION: We conclude that positional isomerism is crucial for the antineoplastic effect of NO-ASA in CLL. It can be suggested that the para-isomer, but not the meta-isomer, generates a chemical structure which is essential for the neoplastic effect of NO-ASA.","['Gehrke, Iris', 'Razavi, Regina', 'Poll-Wolbeck, Simon Jonas', 'Berkessel, Albrecht', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Gehrke I', 'Razavi R', 'Poll-Wolbeck SJ', 'Berkessel A', 'Hallek M', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3573417,2011/10/01 00:00,2011/10/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620711416272 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620711416272 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2011 Oct;2(5):279-89. doi: 10.1177/2040620711416272.,5,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'isomerism', 'nitric-oxide-donating acetylsalicylic acid (NO-ASA)', 'nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)', 'xenograft']",,,,,,,

In the past few decades, the incidence of IFI has increased dramatically. The certainty of diagnosis of IFI is based on host factors, clinical evidence, and microbiological examination. Advancement in molecular diagnostic modalities (e.g. non-culture-based serum biomarkers such as beta-glucan or galactomannan assays) and high-resolution radiological imaging has improved our diagnostic approach. The early use of these diagnostic tests assists in the early initiation of preemptive therapy. Nonetheless, the complexity of IFI in patients with leukemia and the limitations of these diagnostic tools still mandate astute clinical acumen. Its management has been further complicated by the increasing frequency of infection by non-Aspergillus molds (e.g. zygomycosis) and the emergence of drug-resistant fungal pathogens. In addition, even though the antifungal armamentarium has expanded rapidly in the past few decades, the associated mortality remains high. The decision to initiate antifungal treatment and the choice of anti-fungal therapy requires careful consideration of several factors (e.g. risk stratification, local fungal epidemiologic patterns, concomitant comorbidities, drug-drug interactions, prior history of antifungal use, overall cost, and the pharmacologic profile of the antifungal agents). In order to optimize our diagnostic and therapeutic management of IFI in patients with acute leukemia, further basic research and clinical trials are desperately needed.","['Bhatt, Vijaya R', 'Viola, George M', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra']","['Bhatt VR', 'Viola GM', 'Ferrajoli A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3573411,2011/08/01 00:00,2011/08/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620711410098 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620711410098 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2011 Aug;2(4):231-47. doi: 10.1177/2040620711410098.,4,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['fungus', 'infection', 'leukemia', 'mold', 'yeast']",,,,,,,

The natural history of CLL is extremely variable with a survival time from initial diagnosis that ranges from 2 to more than 20 years. Understanding the clinical diversity and allowing the subclassification of CLL into various prognostic groups not only assists in predicting future outcome for patients, but also helps to direct treatment decisions. Chlorambucil and fludarabine were the standard therapy for CLL for decades. Randomized studies have reported superior overall response and progression-free survival (PFS) for fludarabine compared with alkylator-based therapy and for the fludarabine-cyclophospamide (FC) combination over fludarabine alone. More recently the addition of rituximab to the FC regimen (R-FC) has shown significant improvement in overall response, PFS and overall survival compared with FC alone. However, there are patients for whom this regimen still provides less satisfactory results. Within the above studies CLL patients who have some of the poorer prognostic markers, such as unmutated IgVH genes and/or high beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and those who fail to achieve a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative remission are likely to have a shorter PFS compared with those without these features. Various strategies have been explored to improve the outcome for such patients. These include the addition of agents to a frontline R-FC regimen, use of consolidation and consideration of maintenance. The only group that can be clearly identified pretreatment for whom conventional fludarabine-based therapies produce significantly inferior response rates, PFS and overall survival are the patients who harbour a genetic fault; deletion or mutation or a combination of deletion and mutation of tumour protein p53 (TP53). TP53 inactivation is a less common finding at first treatment but becomes much more common in fludarabine-refractory patients. Alemtuzumab and high-dose corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in this group of CLL patients. Trials combining these two agents have shown improved responses, particularly for those patients with bulky nodal disease for whom alemtuzumab alone may be insufficient. Since the duration of responses remains relatively short, suitable patients should be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation according to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) guidelines. Furthermore, there are a number of other new treatments on the horizon, including humanized antibodies directed against novel targets and small-molecule inhibitors.","['Hewamana, Saman', 'Dearden, Claire']","['Hewamana S', 'Dearden C']","['Department of Haemato-Oncology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3573406,2011/06/01 00:00,2011/06/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620711404469 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620711404469 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2011 Jun;2(3):147-59. doi: 10.1177/2040620711404469.,3,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'high risk', 'prognosis', 'treatment']",,,,,,,

Molecular diagnostics constitute an integral part of the routine monitoring. Results of cytogenetic analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) indicate suboptimal response or treatment failure and guide treatment. New Abl kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib or dasatinib are options after the failure of or intolerance to imatinib, and both are available for first-line treatment of newly diagnosed CML.

The hallmark example of this strategy is use of the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib for treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This remarkable clinical success has also stimulated an expansive search for personalized gene targets in all patients to facilitate broad application of targeted therapy for cancer. However, achievement of this objective will require simultaneous work towards several complementary goals. The first step towards broad application of gene-targeted therapy must entail a rapid means to identify target oncogenes in individual patients. Next, we must identify well-tolerated, gene-specific drugs that are collectively effective against a wide diversity of gene targets. Finally, we must develop protocols by which individual patients are matched with appropriate, gene-targeted drugs in a clinically relevant time frame. While these may seem like difficult tasks, we are fortunate to have a wide variety of new and rapidly evolving research tools at our disposal. These include next-generation sequencing of the genome and transcriptome, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/copy number variations (CNV) and gene expression microarrays, and RNAi libraries for the application of functional screens. In this review we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques with the goal of demonstrating that no single technique will be sufficient as a standalone technology, but rather it will be the integration of all techniques that will enable broad application of gene-targeted cancer therapies.","['Tyner, Jeffrey W']",['Tyner JW'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3573394,2011/04/01 00:00,2011/04/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620711403028 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620711403028 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2011 Apr;2(2):83-93. doi: 10.1177/2040620711403028.,2,,,,,"['K99 CA151457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024140/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['deep sequencing', 'gene chip', 'neoplasia', 'personalized medicine', 'shRNA screen', 'siRNA screen']",,,,,,,

Pan-JAK, predominantly JAK2 and off-target JAK2 inhibitors have been developed in the short span of the past 5 years. These compounds have since been tested to varying success in both in vitro and in vivo settings with several proceeding on to advanced clinical trials. Although it was hoped that these inhibitors would be the silver bullet in the manner than imatinib was to chronic myeloid leukemia, it is becoming apparent that this is not the case for various reasons, chief of which is that a significant reduction of the underlying pathogenic clone is not achieved. In fact, the very notion that the target of JAK2 inhibitors (be it pan-JAK or JAK2 specific) is the mutant JAK2 V617F is being challenged with findings from several clinical trials showing a poor correlation between the reduction in JAK2 V617F mutant allele burden and clinical response. In view of this, it is not surprising that several groups are now investigating combinations of JAK2 inhibitors and other agents in MPN. Although much knowledge has been added in this short span of time, it is apparent that our understanding of the role of JAK2 inhibitors in the treatment scheme of MPN is only beginning.","['Chan, Daniel', 'Koren-Michowitz, Maya']","['Chan D', 'Koren-Michowitz M']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Hospital, Singapore and Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3573400,2011/04/01 00:00,2011/04/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620711401646 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620711401646 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2011 Apr;2(2):61-71. doi: 10.1177/2040620711401646.,2,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2 V617F', 'JAK2 inhibitors', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm']",,,,,,,

Biologically, the mechanisms responsible for lenalidomide activity are yet to be clearly defined. Based on preclinical models and early correlative studies conducted in parallel to clinical trials, lenalidomide has been found to enhance natural killer (NK)- and T-cell activity against tumor cells, alter the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor bed, inhibit angiogenesis, and, to a lesser degree, induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Together, all of these biological effects appear to play a role in the activity observed in CLL or lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide. Given the effect in NK- and T-cell function, lenalidomide is an alternative strategy to enhance the antitumor activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Clinical responses have been observed in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with lenalidomide single agent. The favorable toxicity profile and route of administration made the use of lenalidomide an attractive therapy for certain types of patients (i.e. elderly, chemotherapy unfit, etc.). The erratic but serious incidence of tumor lysis syndrome and/or tumor flare reactions provides challenges in the incorporation of lenalidomide in the management of previously untreated CLL or CLL/lymphoma patients with bulky adenopathy. Correlative studies and/or retrospective analysis of lenalidomide-treated patients had identified several biomarkers associated with clinical endpoints in CLL (i.e. changes in tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha] or vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] levels) or DLBCL (non-GCB phenotype) patients, but need to be validated. Early studies evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in previously untreated indolent lymphoma are promising and warrant further study. In addition, the evaluation of lenalidomide in the maintenance setting or in combination with other target-specific agents (i.e. proteasome inhibitors) in aggressive lymphomas is being addressed in ongoing clinical trials. In summary, lenalidomide is emerging as a biologically active and novel agent in the treatment of B-cell neoplasms. Future translational and clinical studies will further define the role of lenalidomide in the management of de novo or relapsed/refractory CLL or B-cell lymphomas and identify the subset of patients most likely to gain clinical benefit.","['Hernandez-Ilizaliturri, Francisco J', 'Batoo, Sameer A']","['Hernandez-Ilizaliturri FJ', 'Batoo SA']","['Medical Oncology and Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC3573391,2011/02/01 00:00,2011/02/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620710390547 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620710390547 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2011 Feb;2(1):45-53. doi: 10.1177/2040620710390547.,1,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immunomodulatory drug', 'lenalidomide']",,,,,,,

Various microenvironmental stimuli confer a growth advantage on these leukemic cells and extend their survival in vivo. Nevertheless, when cultured in vitro, CLL B-cells rapidly die from apoptosis. Certain cytokines may extend the survival capacity of CLL B-cells in vitro and individual anti-apoptotic effects of several cytokines have been reported. The potential cumulative effect of such cytokines has not been studied. We therefore investigated the effects on CLL B-cells survival in vitro of humoral factors, polyclonal lymphocyte activators and a combination of cytokines known for their anti-apoptotic effects. Purified CLL B-cells were cultured in the presence or absence of various soluble molecules and the leukemic cell response was assessed in terms of viability. Apoptotic cell death was detected by flow cytometry using annexinV and 7-amino-actinomycin. The survival of CLL B-cells in vitro was highly variable. When tested separately, cytokines (IL-2, -6, -10, -12, -15, -21, BAFF and APRIL) improved CLL B cell survival moderately; in combination, they significantly enhanced survival of these cells, even up to 7 days of culture. We also report that humoral factors from autologous serum are important for survival of these malignant cells. Our findings support the concept that the CLL microenvironment is critical and suggest that soluble factors may contribute directly to the prolonged survival of CLL B-cells. Therefore, the combination of cytokines we describe as providing strong resistance to apoptosis in vitro might be used to improve the treatment of CLL.","['Ghamlouch, Hussein', 'Ouled-Haddou, Hakim', 'Damaj, Gandhi', 'Royer, Bruno', 'Gubler, Brigitte', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre']","['Ghamlouch H', 'Ouled-Haddou H', 'Damaj G', 'Royer B', 'Gubler B', 'Marolleau JP']","[""EA4666, Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, UFR de Medecine, Amiens, France. hussein.ghamlouch@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130326,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3608602,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0060370 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-00392 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e60370. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060370.

A shift from apoptotic to necrotic cell death occurred when monocytes were treated with 100 microM azacytidine for more than 12 hours. Necrotic monocytes exhibited characteristics, including enrichment of cell-bound albumin and up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)- and mitochondrial-specific chaperones to protect mitochondrial integrity, which were not observed in other necrotic cells, including HUH-7, A2780, A549 and HOC1a. Our results show that the cell-bound albumin originates in the culture medium rather than from monocyte-derived hepatocytes, and that HSP60 is a potential binding partner of the cell-bound albumin. Proteomic analysis shows that HSP60 and protein disulfide isomerase are the most abundant up-regulated mitochondrial and ER-chaperones, and that both HSP60 and calreticulin are ubiquitinated in necrotic monocytes. In contrast, expression levels of the cytosolic chaperones HSP90 and HSP71 were down-regulated in the azacytidine-treated monocytes, concomitant with an increase in the levels of these chaperones in the cell culture medium. Collectively, our results demonstrates that chaperones from different organelles behave differently in necrotic monocytes, ER- and mitochondrial chaperones being retained and cytosolic and nuclear chaperones being released into the cell culture medium through the ruptured cell membrane. HSP60 may serve as a new target for development of myeloid leukemia treatment.","['Tang, Haiping', 'Tian, Enbing', 'Liu, Chongdong', 'Wang, Qingtao', 'Deng, Haiteng']","['Tang H', 'Tian E', 'Liu C', 'Wang Q', 'Deng H']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130326,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gossypol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Necrosis/*chemically induced', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Proteomics', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",PMC3608663,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0059610 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-28893 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e59610. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0059610.

It forms PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) that act like nuclear relay stations and participate in many cellular functions. In this study, we have examined the proteome of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from normal (PML(+/+)) and PML knockout (PML(-/-)) mice. The aim was to identify proteins that were differentially expressed when MEFs were incapable of producing PML. Using comparative proteomics, total protein were extracted from PML(-/-) and PML(+/+) MEFs, resolved by two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels and the differentially expressed proteins identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Nine proteins (PML, NDRG1, CACYBP, CFL1, RSU1, TRIO, CTRO, ANXA4 and UBE2M) were determined to be down-regulated in PML(-/-) MEFs. In contrast, ten proteins (CIAPIN1, FAM50A, SUMO2 HSPB1 NSFL1C, PCBP2, YWHAG, STMN1, TPD52L2 and PDAP1) were found up-regulated. Many of these differentially expressed proteins play crucial roles in cell adhesion, migration, morphology and cytokinesis. The protein profiles explain why PML(-/-) and PML(+/+) MEFs were morphologically different. In addition, we demonstrated PML(-/-) MEFs were less adhesive, proliferated more extensively and migrated significantly slower than PML(+/+) MEFs. NDRG1, a protein that was down-regulated in PML(-/-) MEFs, was selected for further investigation. We determined that silencing NDRG1expression in PML(+/+) MEFs increased cell proliferation and inhibited PML expression. Since NDRG expression was suppressed in PML(-/-) MEFs, this may explain why these cells proliferate more extensively than PML(+/+) MEFs. Furthermore, silencing NDRG1expression also impaired TGF-beta1 signaling by inhibiting SMAD3 phosphorylation.","['Tang, Mei Kuen', 'Liang, Yong Jia', 'Chan, John Yeuk Hon', 'Wong, Sing Wan', 'Chen, Elve', 'Yao, Yao', 'Gan, Jingyi', 'Xiao, Lihai', 'Leung, Hin Cheung', 'Kung, Hsiang Fu', 'Wang, Hua', 'Lee, Kenneth Ka Ho']","['Tang MK', 'Liang YJ', 'Chan JY', 'Wong SW', 'Chen E', 'Yao Y', 'Gan J', 'Xiao L', 'Leung HC', 'Kung HF', 'Wang H', 'Lee KK']","['Stem Cell and Regeneration Thematic Research Programme, School of Biomedical Sciences, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong. florencetang@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130321,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemotaxis', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3605454,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0059477 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-24091 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e59477. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0059477.

Significant consideration has been given to their possible use for therapeutic benefit. The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3) family of cytidine deaminases are potent immune defense molecules capable of efficiently restricting endogenous retroelements as well as a broad range of viruses including Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human Papilloma virus (HPV), and Human T Cell Leukemia virus (HTLV). The best characterized members of this family are APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) and their restriction of HIV. HIV has evolved to counteract these powerful restriction factors by encoding an accessory gene designated viral infectivity factor (vif). Here we demonstrate that APOBEC3 efficiently restricts CCR5-tropic HIV in the absence of Vif. However, our results also show that CXCR4-tropic HIV can escape from APOBEC3 restriction and replicate in vivo independent of Vif. Molecular analysis identified thymocytes as cells with reduced A3G and A3F expression. Direct injection of vif-defective HIV into the thymus resulted in viral replication and dissemination detected by plasma viral load analysis; however, vif-defective viruses remained sensitive to APOBEC3 restriction as extensive G to A mutation was observed in proviral DNA recovered from other organs. Remarkably, HIV replication persisted despite the inability of HIV to develop resistance to APOBEC3 in the absence of Vif. Our results provide novel insight into a highly specific subset of cells that potentially circumvent the action of APOBEC3; however our results also demonstrate the massive inactivation of CCR5-tropic HIV in the absence of Vif.","['Krisko, John F', 'Martinez-Torres, Francisco', 'Foster, John L', 'Garcia, J Victor']","['Krisko JF', 'Martinez-Torres F', 'Foster JL', 'Garcia JV']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Center for AIDS Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America. john_foster@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130328,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'HIV Infections/*immunology/virology', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Thymocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Virus Replication/*genetics', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics']",PMC3610649,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1003242 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-12-02677 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2013 Mar;9(3):e1003242. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003242.

The molecular mechanisms and transcriptional networks by which MYCN exerts its influence in AML are largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We introduced murine MYCN gene into embryonic zebrafish through a heat-shock promoter and established the stable germline Tg(MYCN:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. N-Myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), negatively controlled by MYCN in human and functionally involved in neutrophil maturation, was significantly under-expressed in this model. Using peripheral blood smear detection, histological section and flow cytometric analysis of single cell suspension from kidney and spleen, we found that MYCN overexpression promoted cell proliferation, enhanced the repopulating activity of myeloid cells and the accumulation of immature hematopoietic blast cells. MYCN enhanced primitive hematopoiesis by upregulating scl and lmo2 expression and promoted myelopoiesis by inhibiting gata1 expression and inducing pu.1, mpo expression. Microarray analysis identified that cell cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, MAPK/Ras, and p53-mediated apoptosis pathways were upregulated. In addition, mismatch repair, transforming and growth factor beta (TGFbeta) were downregulated in MYCN-overexpressing blood cells (p<0.01). All of these signaling pathways are critical in the proliferation and malignant transformation of blood cells. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The above results induced by overexpression of MYCN closely resemble the main aspects of human AML, suggesting that MYCN plays a role in the etiology of AML. MYCN reprograms hematopoietic cell fate by regulating NDRG1 and several lineage-specific hematopoietic transcription factors. Therefore, this MYCN transgenic zebrafish model facilitates dissection of MYCN-mediated signaling in vivo, and enables high-throughput scale screens to identify the potential therapeutic targets.","['Shen, Li-Jing', 'Chen, Fang-Yuan', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Cao, Lan-Fang', 'Kuang, Ying', 'Zhong, Min', 'Wang, Ting', 'Zhong, Hua']","['Shen LJ', 'Chen FY', 'Zhang Y', 'Cao LF', 'Kuang Y', 'Zhong M', 'Wang T', 'Zhong H']","['Department of Hematology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130315,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, myc', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zebrafish']",PMC3598662,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0059070 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-30875 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e59070. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0059070.

Using HL60 model human myeloid leukemia cells, where all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces granulocytic differentiation, we developed two emergent RA-resistant HL60 cell lines which are characterized by loss of RA-inducible G1/G0 arrest, CD11b expression, inducible oxidative metabolism and p47(phox) expression. However, RA-treated RA-resistant HL60 continue to exhibit sustained MEK/ERK activation, and one of the two sequentially emergent resistant lines retains RA-inducible CD38 expression. Other signaling events that define the wild-type (WT) response are compromised, including c-Raf phosphorylation and increased expression of c-Cbl, Vav1, and the Src-family kinases (SFKs) Lyn and Fgr. As shown previously in WT HL60 cells, we found that the SFK inhibitor PP2 significantly increases G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, CD38 and CD11b expression, c-Raf phosphorylation and expression of the aforementioned regulators in RA-resistant HL60. The resistant cells were potentially incapable of developing inducible oxidative metabolism. These results motivate the concept that RA resistance can occur in steps, wherein growth arrest and other differentiation events may be recovered in both emergent lines. Investigating the mechanistic anomalies in resistant cell lines is of therapeutic significance and helps to mechanistically understand the response to retinoic acid's biological effects in WT HL60 cells.","['Jensen, Holly A', 'Styskal, Lauren E', 'Tasseff, Ryan', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Congleton, Johanna', 'Varner, Jeffrey D', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Jensen HA', 'Styskal LE', 'Tasseff R', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Congleton J', 'Varner JD', 'Yen A']","['School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130315,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'NADPH Oxidases/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Tretinoin', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3598855,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0058621 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-34875 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58621. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058621.

Although centriolar satellites have been implicated in protein trafficking in relation to the centrosome and cilium, the details of their function and composition remain unknown. FOP (FGFR1 Oncogene Partner) is a known centrosome protein with homology to the centriolar satellite proteins FOR20 and OFD1. We find that FOP partially co-localizes with the satellite component PCM1 in a cell cycle-dependent manner, similarly to the satellite and cilium component BBS4. As for BBS4, FOP localization to satellites is cell cycle dependent, with few satellites labeled in G1, when FOP protein levels are lowest, and most labeled in G2. FOP-FGFR1, an oncogenic fusion that causes a form of leukemia called myeloproliferative neoplasm, also localizes to centriolar satellites where it increases tyrosine phosphorylation. Depletion of FOP strongly inhibits primary cilium formation in human RPE-1 cells. These results suggest that FOP is a centriolar satellite cargo protein and, as for several other satellite-associated proteins, is involved in ciliogenesis. Localization of the FOP-FGFR1 fusion kinase to centriolar satellites may be relevant to myeloproliferative neoplasm disease progression.","['Lee, Joanna Y', 'Stearns, Tim']","['Lee JY', 'Stearns T']","['Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130312,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Centrioles/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cilia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3595297,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0058589 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-26824 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58589. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058589.

Down-regulation of microRNA-148a (miR-148a) has been reported in certain cancer types. However, the biological role of miR-148a and its related targets in breast cancer are unknown yet. In this study, we showed that the level of miR-148a was lower in MCF7 cells than that in MCF10A cells. V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) is a direct target of miR-148a in human breast cancer cells through direct binding of miR-148a to ERBB3 3'-UTR region. Overexpression of miR-148a in MCF7 cells inhibited ERBB3 expression, blocked the downstream pathway activation including activation of AKT, ERK1/2, and p70S6K1, and decreased HIF-1alpha expression. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-148a attenuated tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Our results identify ERBB3 as a direct target of miR-148a, and provide direct evidence that miR-148a inhibits tumor angiogenesis through ERBB3 and its downstream signaling molecules. This information would be helpful for targeting the miR-148a/ERBB3 pathway for breast cancer prevention and treatment in the future.","['Yu, Jing', 'Li, Qi', 'Xu, Qing', 'Liu, Lingzhi', 'Jiang, Binghua']","['Yu J', 'Li Q', 'Xu Q', 'Liu L', 'Jiang B']","['Lab of Reproductive Medicine, Department of Pathology, Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Biomed Res,Journal of biomedical research,101551157,,,PMC3597061,2011/05/01 00:00,2011/05/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/S1674-8301(11)60022-5 [doi]', 'jbr-25-03-170 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biomed Res. 2011 May;25(3):170-7. doi: 10.1016/S1674-8301(11)60022-5.,3,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ERBB3', 'angiogenesis', 'breast cancer', 'microRNA-148a']",,,,,,,

The proposed method for the estimation of parameters for a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that represent the time course of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations during glucose tolerance test (GTT) in physiological studies is presented. The aim of this study was to explore how to interpret those laboratory glucose and insulin data as well as enhance the Ackerman mathematical model. METHODS: Parameters estimation for a system of ODEs was performed by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (SSR) function, which quantifies the difference between theoretical model predictions and GTT's experimental observations. Our proposed perturbation search and multiple-shooting methods were applied during the estimating process. RESULTS: Based on the Ackerman's published data, we estimated the key parameters by applying R-based iterative computer programs. As a result, the theoretically simulated curves perfectly matched the experimental data points. Our model showed that the estimated parameters, computed frequency and period values, were proven a good indicator of diabetes. CONCLUSION: The present paper introduces a computational algorithm to biomedical problems, particularly to endocrinology and metabolism fields, which involves two coupled differential equations with four parameters describing the glucose-insulin regulatory system that Ackerman proposed earlier. The enhanced approach may provide clinicians in endocrinology and metabolism field insight into the transition nature of human metabolic mechanism from normal to impaired glucose tolerance.","['Shiang, Keh-Dong', 'Kandeel, Fouad']","['Shiang KD', 'Kandeel F']","['Division of Biostatistics, Department of Information Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010-3000, USA ; Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010-3000, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Biomed Res,Journal of biomedical research,101551157,,,PMC3596681,2010/09/01 00:00,2010/09/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/S1674-8301(10)60048-6 [doi]', 'jbr-24-05-347 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biomed Res. 2010 Sep;24(5):347-64. doi: 10.1016/S1674-8301(10)60048-6.,5,,,,,['U42 RR016607/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Coupled ordinary differential equations', 'cost function', 'glucose tolerance test', 'multiple shooting method', 'parameters estimation', 'sum of squared residuals']",,,,,,,

In this research, we investigated the remedial effect of sIL-1-RII administration on endometriosis in the nude mouse model. METHODS: NINETEEN NUDE MODEL MICE WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS: group A was treated by intraperitoneal administration with only sIL-1 RII for two weeks, group B was similarly treated with only IL-1, and group C (control) was administered saline . After 2 weeks, the size of the ectopic endometrial lesions was calculated, and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and B-cell lymphoma leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) were detected by immunohistochemistry. The IL-8 and VEGF levels in the peritoneal fluid (PF) and serum were also measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The mean size of ectopic endometrial lesion did not differ between the three groups (P > 0.05). Compared with the control, the expression of VEGF and Bcl-2 was significantly lower in group A, and higher in group B. In the three groups, the levels of IL-8 in the PF and serum were highest in group A, and lowest in group B. CONCLUSION: sIL-1 RII may suppresse hyperplasia of ectopic endometriosis, perhaps by reducing the expression of certain cytokines, such as VEGF, IL-8, and Bcl-2, which could provide a new clinical strategy for the treatment of endometriosis.","['Gao, Liying', 'Sun, Liang', 'Cui, Yugui', 'Hou, Zhen', 'Gao, Li', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Mao, Yundong', 'Han, Suping', 'Liu, Jiayin']","['Gao L', 'Sun L', 'Cui Y', 'Hou Z', 'Gao L', 'Zhou J', 'Mao Y', 'Han S', 'Liu J']","['Center of Clinical Reproductive Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029 ; Suzhou Municipal Hospital & Suzhou Medical Center for Maternal and Child Health, Suzhou 215002, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Biomed Res,Journal of biomedical research,101551157,,,PMC3596534,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2009/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/S1674-8301(10)60007-3 [doi]', 'jbr-24-01-043 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biomed Res. 2010 Jan;24(1):43-50. doi: 10.1016/S1674-8301(10)60007-3.,1,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Interleukin-1', 'endometriosis', 'nude mouse model', 'soluble interleukin-1 receptor type II']",,,,,,,

TIM3 is also expressed by monocytes, natural killer cells, and several T cell subsets; however, normal myeloblasts have not been well-characterized or compared to AML. A specific flow cytometric marker capable of separating leukemic myeloblasts from non-neoplastic myeloblasts would be diagnostically useful, especially in the post-chemotherapy setting. METHODS: TIM3 myeloblast expression was assessed in 69 bone marrow and/or peripheral blood specimens, including 27 AML and 42 non-neoplastic cases (20 with a recent history of chemotherapy). TIM3 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was evaluated within myeloblast, monocyte, T cell, and natural killer cell populations. RESULTS: The median percentage of myeloblasts positive for TIM3 was lower in non-neoplastic specimens without a history of recent chemotherapy (50.3%) as compared to AML (71.4%), but not significantly different as compared to non-leukemic myeloblasts in the post-chemotherapy setting (72.4%). Mean myeloblast TIM3 MFI was higher in AML myeloblasts and non-leukemic myeloblasts in the post-chemotherapy setting as compared to non-neoplastic myeloblasts in cases lacking a history of chemotherapy. Mean monocyte, natural killer cell, and T-cell TIM3 MFI remained relatively constant in varied clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that leukemic myeloblasts overexpress TIM3 as compared to non-neoplastic controls; however, high levels of expression may also be seen among non-leukemic myeloblasts in the post-chemotherapy setting. This overlap limits the diagnostic utility of TIM3 as a specific marker of neoplasia.","['Roth, Christine G', 'Garner, Kelly', 'Eyck, Stephen Ten', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Kane, Lawrence P', 'Craig, Fiona E']","['Roth CG', 'Garner K', 'Eyck ST', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Kane LP', 'Craig FE']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA. garciac@upmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130329,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS), it is feasible to generate data to interrogate the difference in methylation status for genome-wide loci using case-control design. However, a proper and efficient statistical test is lacking. There are several challenges. First, unlike methylation experiments using microarrays, where there is one measure of methylation for one individual at a particular CpG site, here we have the counts of methylation allele and unmethylation allele for each individual. Second, due to the nature of sample preparation, the measured methylation reflects the methylation status of a mixture of cells involved in sample preparation. Therefore, the underlying distribution of the measured methylation level is unknown, and a robust test is more desirable than parametric approach. Third, currently NGS measures methylation at over 2 million CpG sites. Any statistical tests have to be computationally efficient in order to be applied to the NGS data. Taking these challenges into account, we propose a test for differential methylation based on clustered data analysis by modeling the methylation counts. We performed simulations to show that it is robust under several distributions for the measured methylation levels. It has good power and is computationally efficient. Finally, we apply the test to our NGS data on chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The results indicate that it is a promising and practical test.","['Xu, Hongyan', 'Podolsky, Robert H', 'Ryu, Duchwan', 'Wang, Xiaoling', 'Su, Shaoyong', 'Shi, Huidong', 'George, Varghese']","['Xu H', 'Podolsky RH', 'Ryu D', 'Wang X', 'Su S', 'Shi H', 'George V']","['Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Georgia Health Sciences University, Augusta, GA 30912-4900, USA. hxu@gru.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130401,United States,Genet Epidemiol,Genetic epidemiology,8411723,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Models, Statistical', 'Research Design', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Software']",PMC5896022,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gepi.21726 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Epidemiol. 2013 May;37(4):377-82. doi: 10.1002/gepi.21726.

The A/B-ring exocyclic enol ether 32 was prepared through a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of the B-ring vinyl iodide 18 and the alkylborate 33 and subsequent closure of the A-ring by using diastereoselective bromoetherification as the key transformation. Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of 32 with acetate-derived enol phosphate 49, followed by ring-closing metathesis of the derived diene, produced the D-ring. Subsequent closure of the C-ring through a mixed thioacetalization completed the synthesis of the A/BCD-ring fragment 8. The A/BCD- and F'GHIJ-ring fragments (i.e., 8 and 9) were assembled through Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. The C25 stereogenic center was elaborated by exploiting the intrinsic conformational property of the seven-membered F'-ring. After the oxidative cleavage of the F'-ring, the E-ring was formed as a cyclic mixed thioacetal (i.e., 70) and then stereoselectively allylated by using glycosylation chemistry. Ring-closing metathesis of the diene 3 thus obtained closed the F-ring and completed the polycyclic ether skeleton. Finally, the J-ring side chain was introduced by using a Julia-Kocienski olefination in the presence of CeCl3 to complete the total synthesis of gambieric acid A (1), thereby unambiguously establishing its complete stereostructure. The present total synthesis enabled us to evaluate the antifungal and antiproliferative activities of 1 and several synthetic analogues.","['Ishigai, Kazuya', 'Fuwa, Haruhiko', 'Hashizume, Keisuke', 'Fukazawa, Ryo', 'Cho, Yuko', 'Yotsu-Yamashita, Mari', 'Sasaki, Makoto']","['Ishigai K', 'Fuwa H', 'Hashizume K', 'Fukazawa R', 'Cho Y', 'Yotsu-Yamashita M', 'Sasaki M']","['Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130328,Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,IM,"['Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ciguatoxins/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ethers/chemistry', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/chem.201204303 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2013 Apr 22;19(17):5276-88. doi: 10.1002/chem.201204303.

CK2 is composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits, and CK2-dependent phosphorylation is a global mechanism in the inhibition of caspase signaling pathways. The serum response factor (SRF) is an important regulator of cell growth and differentiation. Although CK2 has been shown to phosphorylate SRF in vitro, the biological relevance of this interaction remains largely unclear. We observed increased SRF phosphorylation and increased Mcl-1 gene expression in hippocampal CA1 neurons following transfection with a plasmid expressing the wild-type CK2alpha (CK2alphaWT) protein, whereas transfection with a plasmid expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of CK2alpha (CK2alpha156A) reduced Mcl-1 gene expression. Cotransfection with a plasmid expressing the inactive SRF99A mutant inhibited the CK2alphaWT-induced upregulation of Mcl-1 gene expression. The expression of either the CK2alpha156A or the SRF99A mutant also inhibited the glutamate-induced upregulation of Mcl-1 protein expression in PC12 cells. Our results suggest that CK2-mediated signaling represents a cellular mechanism that may aid in the development of alternative therapeutic strategies to attenuate apoptosis in hippocampal neurons.","['Chang, Chia-Ming', 'Chao, Chih Chang']","['Chang CM', 'Chao CC']","['Institute of Neurosciences, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130329,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,IM,"['Animals', 'Casein Kinase II/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Hippocampus/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'PC12 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serum Response Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transfection']",,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.23212 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2013 Jun;91(6):808-17. doi: 10.1002/jnr.23212.

The aim of this study was to determine the value and prognostic significance of TB-CT scan in early stage CLL patients. Baseline TB-CT scan was performed in 240 Binet stage A CLL patients (179 Rai low- and 61 Rai intermediate-risk) included in a prospective multicenter observational study (clinicaltrial.gov ID:NCT00917549). The cohort included 69 clinical monoclonal B lymphocytosis (cMBLs). Patients were restaged considering only radiological data. Following TB-CT scans, 20% of cases reclassified as radiologic Binet (r-Binet) stage B. r-Binet B patients showed a higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.027), as well as a shorter PFS (P = 0.001). At multivariate analysis, r-Binet stage [HR = 2.48; P = 0.004] and IGHV mutational status [HR = 3.01; P = 0.002] retained an independent predictive value for PFS. Among 179 Rai low-risk cases, 100 were redefined as r-Rai intermediate-risk based upon TB-CT scan data, showing a higher rate of cases with higher ZAP-70 (P = 0.033) and CD38 expression (P = 0.029) and beta2-microglobulin levels (P < 0.0001), as well as a shorter PFS than those with r-Rai low-risk (P = 0.008). r-Rai stage [HR = 2.78; P = 0.046] and IGHV mutational status [HR = 4.25; P = 0.009] retained a significant predictive value for PFS at multivariate analysis.

Choosing the most appropriate TKI requires clinicians to consider a host of patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors, not the least of which include the safety profiles of the agents. This review discusses the potential impact of treatment-, patient-, and disease-related characteristics on the emergence of adverse events during TKI therapy, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms believed to be responsible for a number of important adverse events associated with these agents and what implications they may have for treatment choice, particularly in the setting of first-line treatment. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles that described the molecular mechanisms of BCR-ABL1-mediated leukemic transformation, the efficacy and safety of imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib in patients with CML, the kinase-binding spectrum of each TKI, and evidence suggesting a link between the TKI-binding profile and adverse events. The pattern of adverse events associated with each agent is important when selecting treatment with a TKI. Clinical studies suggest that imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib have differing safety profiles, which are in part attributable to the specificity and selectivity of each agent. Although much basic research must be conducted to further illuminate the mechanisms responsible for TKI-related adverse events, on- and off-target effects are believed to be at least partly responsible for cardiovascular toxicity, myelosuppression, fluid retention, gastrointestinal toxicity, and dermatologic toxicity. Increased understanding of the factors that affect TKI-associated adverse events and long-term safety data will enable a more informed approach to the selection of therapy best suited to the individual needs of patients with CML.","['Irvine, Elizabeth', 'Williams, Casey']","['Irvine E', 'Williams C']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Kansas Hospital, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130403,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Nitriles/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,2013/04/05 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1266 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2013 Aug;33(8):868-81. doi: 10.1002/phar.1266.

However, most of these studies have used retrospective data. We examined prospectively whether alcohol consumption decreases the risk of both lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms, including most common subtypes. Moreover, we investigated whether this decreased risk is due to ethanol or other contents of specific alcoholic beverages (i.e., beer, wine and liquor). The Netherlands cohort study consisted of 120,852 individuals who completed a baseline questionnaire in 1986. After 17.3 years of follow-up, 1,375 cases of lymphoid and 245 cases of myeloid neoplasms with complete exposure information were available for analysis. Compared with abstinence, we observed for plasma cell neoplasms hazard rate ratios (HR) of 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-2.29), 1.63 (95% CI, 1.17-2.27), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.75-1.64) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.51-1.42) with daily ethanol consumption of 0.1-<5, 5-<15, 15-<30 and >/=30 g, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. No associations were observed for other subtypes and for myeloid neoplasms. When results were analyzed by beverage type, no clear associations were observed. In conclusion, our study did not show an inverse association between alcohol consumption and lymphoid neoplasms. Also, no inverse association was observed with myeloid neoplasms. If any association between alcohol consumption and lymphoid neoplasms exists, our study suggests an increased risk rather than a decreased risk.","['Heinen, Mirjam M', 'Verhage, Bas A J', 'Schouten, Leo J', 'Goldbohm, R Alexandra', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'van den Brandt, Piet A']","['Heinen MM', 'Verhage BA', 'Schouten LJ', 'Goldbohm RA', 'Schouten HC', 'van den Brandt PA']","['School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Department of Epidemiology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130424,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Alcohol Drinking/*adverse effects', 'Alcoholic Beverages/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Plasma Cell/*epidemiology', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28175 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Oct 1;133(7):1701-12. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28175.

These results suggest that cell damage was more sensitive to certain scanning conditions, rather than simply high-applied forces.","['Ng, K S', 'Zhou, Z L', 'Ngan, A H W']","['Ng KS', 'Zhou ZL', 'Ngan AH']","['Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, PR China. ngkwoksing@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Cell Death/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*therapy', 'Microscopy/methods', '*Optical Tweezers']",,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/11/14 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24369 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2013 Oct;228(10):2037-41. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24369.,10,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection constitutes a major problem during management of acute leukemia due to resultant portal hypertension or bleeding esophageal varices. Chronic HCV infection is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in leukemic survivors. The effect of amlodipine treatment on children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) having portal hypertension secondary to HCV infection during maintenance chemotherapy has been studied. Sixty male children (mean age 11.83 +/- 1.1 years) with ALL in remission and have HCV infection were included. Diagnosis of HCV infection was confirmed by real-time PCR. Thirty patients received 5 mg amlodipine orally per day for 4 weeks and compared to another 30 patients received placebo therapy and 30 age- and sex-matched children as a control group. Amlodipine significantly reduced the elevated portal blood pressure to normal level in doses which did not interfere with mechanism of action of chemotherapy (p </= 0.001). Treatment with amlodipine can be used to control portal hypertension in leukemic children having HCV-induced portal hypertension. HCV in leukemics could be virtually eliminated by proper testing of the blood transfusion pool.","['El-Ashry, Rasha', 'Malek, Hala Abdel', 'Ghayaty, Essam A Desoky', 'El-Gendy, Ahmed A', 'Darwish, Ahmad', 'Al-Tonbary, Youssef']","['El-Ashry R', 'Malek HA', 'Ghayaty EA', 'El-Gendy AA', 'Darwish A', 'Al-Tonbary Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt. rasha_elashery@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20130404,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Amlodipine/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Heart Rate/drug effects', 'Hepatitis C/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Portal/*drug therapy/*etiology/virology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Portal Pressure/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/physiopathology/virology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2013/04/05 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-013-0559-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2013;30(2):559. doi: 10.1007/s12032-013-0559-y.

AML heterogeneity presents a major challenge to development of targeted therapies, and effective treatment will require targeting of common molecular drivers of AML maintenance. The orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1 and NR4A3 are potent tumor suppressors of AML. They are silenced in all human AML LICs, irrespective of patient cytogenetics, and their deletion in mice leads to postnatal AML development. In the current report, we address the tumor-suppressive mechanisms and therapeutic potential of NR4As for AML intervention. We show that rescue of either NR4A1 or NR4A3 inhibits the leukemogenicity of AML cells in vivo and reprograms a subset of gene signatures that distinguish primary human LICs from normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), irrespective of subtype. Central to NR4A reprogramming is the acute suppression of an LIC submodule that includes the transcriptional repression of MYC. Additionally, we show that upregulation of MYC is an acute preleukemic consequence of NR4A deletion and that MYC suppression functionally contributes to NR4A antileukemic effects. Collectively, these results identify NR4As as novel targets for AML therapeutic intervention and reveal molecular targets of NR4A tumor suppression, including the suppression of MYC.","['Boudreaux, S P', 'Ramirez-Herrick, A M', 'Duren, R P', 'Conneely, O M']","['Boudreaux SP', 'Ramirez-Herrick AM', 'Duren RP', 'Conneely OM']","['Interdepartmental Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120702,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,PMC3412651,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['oncsis201219 [pii]', '10.1038/oncsis.2012.19 [doi]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2012 Jul 2;1:e19. doi: 10.1038/oncsis.2012.19.,,,,,,"['R01 CA111411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL092332/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
