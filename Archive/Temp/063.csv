Cytoreductive therapies have been used in older patients and those with a history of thrombosis to achieve these goals. Hydroxyurea (HU) remains the first-line cytoreductive choice; however, up to one in four patients treated with HU over time will develop resistance or intolerance to HU. More importantly, patients who fail HU have a 5.6-fold increase in mortality and a 6.8-fold increase risk of transformation to myelofibrosis or AML; therefore, alternative therapies are needed for these patients. Interferon-alpha has been used in PV and has shown significant activity in achieving hematologic responses and decreasing JAK2 V617F mutation allele burden. JAK inhibition has also been investigated and recently garnered regulatory approval for this indication. In this review, we will discuss the current treatment options that are available for patients after HU and the novel therapies that are currently under investigation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The outcomes of PV patients who fail or who are intolerant of hydroxyurea are poor. Although pegylated interferon can be considered in younger patients, currently, ruxolitinib is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent in this setting, representing a viable option, leading to hematocrit control and a reduction in spleen size and constitutional symptoms. Although a small number of patients will achieve a molecular response with continuous treatment, the implications of such response on the clinical outcomes are still unknown. Patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with ruxolitinib, or who lose their response, can be treated with low-dose busulfan or pipobroman; however, they should be encouraged to participate in trials with novel therapies.",['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],"['Nazha, Aziz', 'Gerds, Aaron T']","['Nazha A', 'Gerds AT']","['Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA gerdsa@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160314,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Nitriles', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Thrombosis/drug therapy/pathology']",PMC4828120,['NOTNLM'],"['Hydroxyurea', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Polycythemia vera', 'Ruxolitinib']",2016/03/16 06:00,2016/12/24 06:00,['2016/03/16 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2015-0380 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0380 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2016 Apr;21(4):475-80. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0380.

METHODS: The clinical data and cranial MRI results of 62 children with ALL who were hospitalized from March 2014 to June 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Before chemotherapy, MRI showed bone marrow infiltration of the skull in 33 patients (53%); the children with WBC<20x10(9)/Lhad a significantly lower incidence rate of bone marrow infiltration of the skull than those with WBC>/=20x10(9)/L (16 patients/42% vs 17 patients/71%; P<0.05), and the high-risk group had a significantly higher incidence rate of bone marrow infiltration of the skull than the non-high-risk group (71% vs 44%; P<0.05). Before chemotherapy, there were 4 cases (7%) of brain atrophy, and 2 cases (3%) of abnormal signals in the sensory conduction bundle. MRI reexamination in 28 patients after 3 months of chemotherapy showed 3 new cases (11%) of brain atrophy and 1 aggravated case of brain atrophy.

Frequent changes in the behavior of this disease generates an enormous volume of data. Microarray data satisfies both the veracity and velocity properties of big data, as it keeps changing with time. Therefore, the analysis of microarray datasets in a small amount of time is essential. They often contain a large amount of expression, but only a fraction of it comprises genes that are significantly expressed. The precise identification of genes of interest that are responsible for causing cancer are imperative in microarray data analysis. Most existing schemes employ a two-phase process such as feature selection/extraction followed by classification. In this paper, various statistical methods (tests) based on MapReduce are proposed for selecting relevant features. After feature selection, a MapReduce-based K-nearest neighbor (mrKNN) classifier is also employed to classify microarray data. These algorithms are successfully implemented in a Hadoop framework. A comparative analysis is done on these MapReduce-based models using microarray datasets of various dimensions. From the obtained results, it is observed that these models consume much less execution time than conventional models in processing big data.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In some patients, a malignancy can even be the first or only symptom of an underlying genetic defect. The possibility of an underlying PID is important for the pediatric oncologist as this might influence the treatment. Also, patients with a known PID should be screened for the occurrence of cancer.

The etiology of ANKL is unclear with few genetic/epigenetic aberrations described to date. Moreover, misdiagnosis of ANKL is a frequent problem. Clinicopathologic characteristics of 35 retrospective cases of ANKL were investigated with the aim of improving diagnosis and to find the genetic/epigenetic aberrations associated with ANKL etiology. Because of the relatively low number of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, diagnosis of ANKL can be missed; therefore, it is important to perform biopsy on solid tissues, if necessary. We describe the pathology of ANKL in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, liver, and skin, with focus on diagnosis and differentiated diagnosis. We observed young male predominance in our cohort, and the clinical course was more aggressive than reported previously. Low lactate dehydrogenase (<712 IU/L), chemotherapy or L-asparaginase administration were found to be associated with more favorable outcomes. SH2 domains of STAT5B and STAT3 also were screened for the presence of activating mutations. Moreover, CpG island methylation status of HACE1, a candidate tumor-suppressor gene, was determined in ANKL samples. We observed activating STAT5B mutations (1/5) and hypermethylation of HACE1 (3/4) in ANKL cases, suggesting that these aberrations may contribute to ANKL pathogenesis.",,"['Gao, Li-Min', 'Zhao, Sha', 'Liu, Wei-Ping', 'Zhang, Wen-Yan', 'Li, Gan-Di', 'Kucuk, Can', 'Hu, Xiao-Zhou', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Tang, Yuan', 'Ding, Wen-Shuang', 'Yan, Jia-Qi', 'Yao, Wen-Qing', 'Wang, Jian Chao']","['Gao LM', 'Zhao S', 'Liu WP', 'Zhang WY', 'Li GD', 'Kucuk C', 'Hu XZ', 'Chan WC', 'Tang Y', 'Ding WS', 'Yan JQ', 'Yao WQ', 'Wang JC']","['*Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China daggerDepartment of Pathology, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA double daggerIzmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute (iBG-izmir) section signDepartment of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,2016/03/15 06:00,2017/07/20 06:00,['2016/03/15 06:00'],"['2016/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0000000000000634 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2016 Jun;40(6):836-46. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000634.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Type II EATL is considered to be a tumor of intraepithelial lymphocytes. However, the evaluation of intraepithelial lymphocytosis by biopsy specimens is challenging, which poses a diagnostic problem between the EATL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. This situation requested us to establish a pragmatic diagnostic approach for the classification of GITCL. We identified 42 cases of GITCL and analyzed clinicopathologic features, especially addressing their T-cell receptor (TCR) phenotype. Nine (21%) of 42 GITCL cases were positive for TCRgamma protein expression. Among these TCRgamma cases, TCRbeta expression or not was detected in 5 and 4, respectively, but resulted in no further clinicopathologic differences. TCRbeta positivity without TCRgamma expression (betagamma) was seen in 9 GITCL patients (21%). Twenty-four patients (57%) were negative for TCRbeta and gamma expression (betagamma). Compared with TCRbetagamma or betagamma type, TCRgamma cases were characterized by exclusive involvement of intestinal sites (100% vs. 11%, P<0.001; 100% vs. 58%, P=0.032, respectively), but not of stomach (0% vs. 78%, P=0.002; 0% vs. 38%, P=0.039, respectively). Notably, TCRgamma positivity was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor among our GITCL patients (P<0.001).

Data from the national Cancer Registry were linked to the study participants. A total of 1431 persons with haemophilia and 7150 matched controls were enrolled. Between the years 1972 and 2008, 164 malignancies were reported. The most common type of cancer among patients was prostate cancer, followed by haematologic malignancies, including lymphoma and leukaemia, which were significantly more frequent in patients [n = 35 (2.4%) vs. n = 60 (0.8%); P < 0.001]. Malignancies in bladder and other urinary organs were also significantly different [n = 21 (1.5%) vs. n = 46 (0.6%); P < 0.01].

In subgroup analysis, the corresponding incidence rate ratios per 1000 person-years for persons with severe haemophilia was 1.7 (95% CI 0.9, 3.1) and that for mild/moderate haemophilia 1.1 (95% CI 0.8, 1.5). Swedish persons with haemophilia had a significantly higher incidence of malignant diseases than controls.

To test a tumor suppressive role for PTEN in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we induced Cre-mediated deletion of Pten in mouse models of pre-B ALL. In contrast to its role as a tumor suppressor in other cancers, loss of one or both alleles of Pten caused rapid cell death of pre-B ALL cells and was sufficient to clear transplant recipient mice of leukemia. Small-molecule inhibition of PTEN in human pre-B ALL cells resulted in hyperactivation of AKT, activation of the p53 tumor suppressor cell cycle checkpoint and cell death. Loss of PTEN function in pre-B ALL cells was functionally equivalent to acute activation of autoreactive pre-B cell receptor signaling, which engaged a deletional checkpoint for the removal of autoreactive B cells.

Loss-of-function mutations in the gene-encoding adaptor protein LNK (also known as SH2B3) are found in Ph-like ALLs; however, it is not clear how LNK regulates normal B cell development or promotes leukemogenesis. Here, we have shown that combined loss of Lnk and tumor suppressors Tp53 or Ink4a/Arf in mice triggers a highly aggressive and transplantable precursor B-ALL. Tp53-/-Lnk-/- B-ALLs displayed similar gene expression profiles to human Ph-like B-ALLs, supporting use of this model for preclinical and molecular studies. Preleukemic Tp53-/-Lnk-/- pro-B progenitors were hypersensitive to IL-7, exhibited marked self-renewal in vitro and in vivo, and were able to initiate B-ALL in transplant recipients. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that LNK regulates pro-B progenitor homeostasis by attenuating IL-7-stimuated JAK/STAT5 signaling via a direct interaction with phosphorylated JAK3. Moreover, JAK inhibitors were effective in prolonging survival of mice transplanted with Lnk-/-Tp53-/- leukemia. Additionally, synergistic administration of PI3K/mTOR and JAK inhibitors further abrogated leukemia development. Hence, our results suggest that LNK suppresses IL-7R/JAK/STAT signaling to restrict pro-/pre-B progenitor expansion and leukemia development, providing a pathogenic mechanism and a potential therapeutic approach for B-ALLs with LNK mutations.",,"['Cheng, Ying', 'Chikwava, Kudakwashe', 'Wu, Chao', 'Zhang, Haibing', 'Bhagat, Anchit', 'Pei, Dehua', 'Choi, John K', 'Tong, Wei']","['Cheng Y', 'Chikwava K', 'Wu C', 'Zhang H', 'Bhagat A', 'Pei D', 'Choi JK', 'Tong W']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160314,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lnk protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4811117,,,2016/03/15 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/03/15 06:00'],"['2015/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['81468 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI81468 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Apr 1;126(4):1267-81. doi: 10.1172/JCI81468.

In vitro, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have recently been shown to play important roles in posttranscriptional regulation; however, the contribution of RBPs to cell specification is not well understood. Here, we determined that the RBP insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) is specifically overexpressed in mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged (MLL-rearranged) B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which constitutes a subtype of this malignancy associated with poor prognosis and high risk of relapse. IGF2BP3 was required for the survival of B-ALL cell lines, as knockdown led to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Enforced expression of IGF2BP3 provided murine BM cells with a strong survival advantage, led to proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and skewed hematopoietic development to the B cell/myeloid lineage. Cross-link immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing uncovered the IGF2BP3-regulated transcriptome, which includes oncogenes MYC and CDK6 as direct targets. IGF2BP3 regulated transcripts via targeting elements within 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR), and enforced IGF2BP3 expression in mice resulted in enhanced expression of Myc and Cdk6 in BM. Together, our data suggest that IGF2BP3-mediated targeting of oncogenic transcripts may represent a critical pathogenetic mechanism in MLL-rearranged B-ALL and support IGF2BP3 and its cognate RNA-binding partners as potential therapeutic targets in this disease.",,"['Palanichamy, Jayanth Kumar', 'Tran, Tiffany M', 'Howard, Jonathan M', 'Contreras, Jorge R', 'Fernando, Thilini R', 'Sterne-Weiler, Timothy', 'Katzman, Sol', 'Toloue, Masoud', 'Yan, Weihong', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Sanford, Jeremy R', 'Rao, Dinesh S']","['Palanichamy JK', 'Tran TM', 'Howard JM', 'Contreras JR', 'Fernando TR', 'Sterne-Weiler T', 'Katzman S', 'Toloue M', 'Yan W', 'Basso G', 'Pigazzi M', 'Sanford JR', 'Rao DS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160314,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (IGFBP3 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4811152,,,2016/03/15 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/03/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['80046 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI80046 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Apr 1;126(4):1495-511. doi: 10.1172/JCI80046.

The leukemia cell microenvironment consists of not only the stromal and endothelial cell components but also the normal hematopoietic cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is a latent transcription factor that is normally transiently activated by phosphorylation in response to microenvironmental signals. In hematopoietic cells, persistently activated STAT5 via aberrant receptor signaling, Janus kinases (JAKs), or intracellular tyrosine kinases is a bona fide driver of leukemogenesis. However, active IL-7/STAT5 signaling also protects the early B-cell genome by suppressing error-prone recombination and vulnerability to transformation. Along these lines, we have reported that lymphocyte development from transplanted STAT5-deficient fetal liver cells was blocked at the pre-pro-B-cell stage but when combined with transgenic Myc and Bcl-2 promoted faster initiation of B-ALL. Furthermore, inflammatory responses may also be involved in leukemia initiation in both pediatric and adult patients which are associated with decreased phosphorylation of STAT5. Likewise, additional targeted agents continue to be developed for precision medicine that prominently suppress signaling pathways. A common theme of all of these perturbations is potential risk for dysregulating hematopoiesis through general transcriptional modulation. Here we discuss the potential for STAT5 inhibition as a double edged sword in certain hematologic disorders, such as early B-cell lymphoblastic leukemias. Considering the rapid pace of understanding of the pre-leukemic decrease in poly-clonality that precedes leukemia, the functional changes associated with microenvironmental influences are thus of potential clinical significance.",,"['Wang, Zhengqi', 'Bunting, Kevin D']","['Wang Z', 'Bunting KD']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160222,United States,Cancer Cell Microenviron,Cancer cell & microenvironment,101647794,,,,PMC4786082,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'JAK/STAT', 'Myc', 'cytokine signaling', 'hematopoiesis', 'lymphoid neoplasia']",2016/03/15 06:00,2016/03/15 06:01,['2016/03/15 06:00'],"['2016/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.14800/ccm.1186 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Cell Microenviron. 2016;3(1). doi: 10.14800/ccm.1186.

For the first time, the French network of cancer registries (Francim) provides estimates for incidence and trends of HM in France between 1980 and 2012 for major HM subtypes. METHODS: Incidence was directly estimated by modeling the incidence rates measured in the cancer registry area. For each HM subtype, a ""usable incidence period"" was defined a priori, corresponding to the years for which all the registries collected them in a homogeneous way. For both sexes and each HM subtype, age-period-cohort models were used to estimate national incidence trends. RESULTS: Overall in France, there were an estimated 35,000 new HMs in 2012 (19,400 in men and 15,600 in women). Lymphoid malignancies accounted for more than two-thirds of HM incident cases (n=25,136). The incidence sex ratio (M/F) varied from 1.1 for classical Hodgkin lymphoma to 4.0 for mantle-cell lymphoma. The median age at diagnosis ranged from 62 to 81 years according to the major HM subtypes. Overall in both sexes, the top five most frequent HMs in 2012 were plasma cell neoplasm (about 4900 estimated cases), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (4500 cases), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndromes (4100 cases), and acute myeloid leukemia (2800 cases). The incidence rates increased for follicular lymphoma and plasma cell neoplasm during the study period in both sexes. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma was relatively stable in men between 1980 and 2012 and increased in both sexes during the most recent period. Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, other than chronic myelogenous leukemia, are the only subtype that showed a slightly downward trend in incidence between 2003 and 2012 in both sexes. CONCLUSION: The striking differences in the incidence patterns by histologic subtype strongly suggest a certain level of etiologic heterogeneity among hematological malignancies and support the pursuit of epidemiologic analysis by subtype for HMs in international studies. Age-standardized incidence rates are essential to analyze trends in risk, whereas the number of incident cases is necessary to make provisions for healthcare resources and to evaluate the overall burden of HM.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the literature, only four studies have described three different invasive gynecologic cancers of epithelial origin identified simultaneously in the same patient. CASE PRESENTATION: This is the first case in the literature that reports on triple primary ovarian, endometrial and endocervical cancers in a 38-year-old woman with a history of previously treated malignant disease (acute lymphatic leukemia). With a preoperative diagnosis of endocervical adenocarcinoma stage Ib1 (according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics-FIGO), as well as an adnexal mass, she underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix, an endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus, and a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the left ovary. Eighteen months after appropriate treatment, the patient is free of disease. CONCLUSION: The incidental diagnosis of more than one tumor is often a post-operative finding, usually with the detection of low-stage neoplasms. Multiple synchronous gynecologic cancers have a better prognosis than metastatic or advanced primitive disease. In a patient with multiple neoplasms, the prognosis is determined by the tumor with the worst prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

METHODS: A total of 50 children APL marrow tissues and 15 normal marrow tissues between January and December in 2012 were collected into our study. The expression of miR-130b in APL and normal marrow tissues were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. MiR-130b inhibitor was transfected into HL-60 cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry were used to measure cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. The expression of PTEN, a potential target of miR-130b, and its downstream genes, Bcl-2 and Bax, in transformed cells were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western-blot. RESULTS: The expression of miR-130b was significantly higher in children APL marrow tissues than in normal marrow tissues (P < 0.05). Down-regulation of miR-130b could significantly suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells (P < 0.05). PTEN expression was upregulated when miR-130b was knocking-down (P < 0.05). As downstream genes of PTEN, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax were regulated as well. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-130b is overexpressed in children APL marrow tissues and associated with cell growth.

For example, LIF has been reported to have a suppressive effect on adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3-L1 cell line, whereas it promoted adipocyte differentiation in the Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A cell lines. Thus, it is possible that the effects of LIF on adipogenesis vary with the developmental stage of the cells or tissues, but the details remain unclear. To further elucidate the role of LIF in adipogenesis, we investigated the effects of LIF on murine bone marrow stromal cells at the early and late stages of adipogenesis. LIF decreased the number of lipid foci and suppressed the expression levels of adipocyte differentiation markers at day 5; however, it enhanced these same traits at day 15. A previous report showed that the expression levels of Wnt signaling molecules are different at the early and late differentiation stages; therefore, we investigated the relationship between LIF and Wnt signaling. LIF affected the mRNA expression levels of different Wnt signaling molecules but inhibited the expression level of beta-catenin protein at both days 5 and 15. Our data suggest that LIF has reciprocal roles during the early and late stages of adipocyte differentiation, regulating the Wnt signaling pathway.",,"['Ikeda, Shun', 'Itoh, Shousaku', 'Yamamoto, Yumiko', 'Yamauchi, Yukako', 'Matsushita, Kenta', 'Naruse, Haruna', 'Hayashi, Mikako']","['Ikeda S', 'Itoh S', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Yamauchi Y', 'Matsushita K', 'Naruse H', 'Hayashi M']","['Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan. ito@dent.osaka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Adipogenesis/*drug effects', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adipocyte differentiation', 'Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)', 'Signal transduction', 'Wnt']",2016/03/15 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/15 06:00'],"['2016/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12013-015-0703-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12013-015-0703-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2016 Mar;74(1):11-7. doi: 10.1007/s12013-015-0703-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Post-marketing surveillance has revealed that the risk of fatal reaction with rituximab use is extremely low. Splenic rupture and cytokine release syndrome are rare fatal adverse events related to the use of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, especially in aggressive malignancies with high tumor burden. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain and type B symptoms and was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma. Initial peripheral blood flow cytometry showed findings that mimicked features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Further treatment with rituximab led to catastrophic treatment complications that proved to be fatal for the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Severe cytokine release syndrome associated with biologics carries a very high morbidity and case fatality rate.

We report on a phase 2 study that was designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of a treatment alternating nilotinib and imatinib, in newly diagnosed BCR-ABL1 positive, chronic phase, CML patients. One hundred twenty-three patients were enrolled. Median age was 56 years. The probabilities of achieving a complete cytogenetic response, a major molecular response, and a deep molecular response (MR 4.0) by 2 years were 93%, 87%, and 61%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival were 89%. Response rates and survival are in the range of those reported with nilotinib alone. Moreover, we observed a relatively low rate of cardiovascular adverse events (5%).

Follow-up time was >/=48 months (both studies). Incidences of vascular/cardiac TEAEs in bosutinib-treated patients were 7%/10% overall with similar incidences observed with first-line bosutinib (5%/8%) and imatinib (4%/6%). Few patients had grade >/=3 vascular/cardiac events (4%/4%) and no individual TEAE occurred in >2% of bosutinib patients.

Feasibility of a speed optimized examination protocol at 3 Tesla.,857-63,10.1016/j.ejrad.2016.02.009 [doi] S0720-048X(16)30038-9 [pii],"OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate a short MRI examination protocol for the detection of nodular pulmonary infiltrates in immunocompromised patients with hematologic diseases and suspected invasive fungal infections. METHODS: Patients with nodular infiltrates on CT scans were examined on a 3T MRI scanner. The standardized protocol included axial T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) sequences +/- fat saturation (FS), and axial T1-weighted gradient echo (GRE) sequences. Long and short axis diameters of nodular infiltrates and visibility were assessed on MR images at least six months after the CT scan, blinded to patient and examination data. Inter- and intra-reader reliability was assessed in two patients. Statistical testing included Wilcoxon-test, Cohen's kappa, and intra-class correlation coefficients. Bland-Altman plots were created to visualize differences in the measurements. RESULTS: In all 13 patients MRI examinations were completed successfully (average examination time 12 min and maximum breath-hold time of 8s). CT detected 409 nodules. Sensitivity of MRI was 93.2% when using all sequences in combination; considering nodules >5mm, sensitivity increased to 97.9%. Reliability analysis showed excellent correlations with an intra-class correlation coefficient of at least 0.89 for T2 FSE (95% CI 0.79-0.93, p<0.01) images for the intra-, and the lowest of 0.77 for T2 FSE (95% CI 0.55-0.89, p<0.01) images for the inter-reader comparison. Agreement on nodule visibility was at least kappa=0.95 (p<0.01) for the intra- and 0.72 (p<0.01) for the inter-reader analysis. CONCLUSION: With an average examination time of 12 min, pulmonary MRI at 3T is feasible in immunocompromised patients with hematologic diseases and suspected invasive fungal infections. MRI might serve as an alternative diagnostic tool during follow-up examinations.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the present study, we found that RNF6 was overexpressed in various leukemia cells and that it accelerated leukemia cell proliferation, whereas knockdown of RNF6 delayed tumor growth in xenografts. To find out the mechanism of RNF6 overexpression in leukemia, we designed a series of truncated constructs of RNF6 regulatory regions in the luciferase reporter system. The results revealed that the region between -144 and -99 upstream of the RNF6 transcription start site was critical and that this region contained a PBX1 recognition element (PRE). PBX1 modulated RNF6 expression by binding to the specific PRE. When PRE was mutated, RNF6 transcription was completely abolished. Further studies showed that PBX1 collaborated with PREP1 but not MEIS1 to modulate RNF6 expression. Moreover, RNF6 expression could be suppressed by doxorubicin, a major anti-leukemia agent, via down-regulating PBX1. This study thus suggests that RNF6 overexpression in leukemia is under the direction of PBX1 and that the PBX1/RNF6 axis can be developed as a novel therapeutic target of leukemia.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Xu, Xin', 'Han, Kunkun', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Zeng, Yuanying', 'Lin, Xu', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Zhang, Zubin', 'Cao, Biyin', 'Wu, Depei', 'Mao, Xinliang']","['Xu X', 'Han K', 'Tang X', 'Zeng Y', 'Lin X', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Cao B', 'Wu D', 'Mao X']","['From the Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Translational Research and Therapeutics of Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123.', 'From the Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Translational Research and Therapeutics of Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, the Asclepius Technology Company Group and Asclepius Cancer Research Center, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'the Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006.', 'From the Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Translational Research and Therapeutics of Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123.', 'From the Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Translational Research and Therapeutics of Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123.', 'the Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123.', 'From the Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Translational Research and Therapeutics of Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123.', 'From the Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Translational Research and Therapeutics of Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123.', 'the Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006.', 'From the Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Translational Research and Therapeutics of Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Preventive and Translational Medicine for Geriatric Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, and xinliangmao@suda.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160312,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNF6 protein, human)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterografts', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Response Elements']",PMC4850299,['NOTNLM'],"['RNF6', 'leukemia', 'oncogene', 'pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1', 'promoter modulation', 'ring finger protein', 'small interfering RNA (siRNA)', 'transcription factor', 'tumor cell biology']",2016/03/14 06:00,2016/11/11 06:00,['2016/03/14 06:00'],"['2015/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43101-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.701979 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Apr 29;291(18):9617-28. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.701979.

The disease remains classically indolent for years preceding a blast crisis. However, the disease can affect all parts of the body. We report here an unusual localization. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old man was followed for 2 years for an indolent chronic lymphocytic leukaemia while he presented a rapidly progressive dysuria. Prostate biopsies were performed concluding to a prostate involvement by the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In the absence of progression according to RAI staging system and Binet's classification, he was treated with local low-dose radiotherapy, twice 2 Gy, allowing for a rapid resolution of the symptoms. No systemic treatment was introduced, and 1 year after the completion of his treatment, he is still under watchful waiting strategy for his chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Low-dose radiotherapy is an underused effective strategy in indolent lymphoma. In this case, urinary symptoms from a prostate involvement were relieved non-invasively at low cost.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).', 'Published by Elsevier SAS.

Both processes act synergistically by increasing the oxidative stress in cancer cells thereby leading to their death. However, in the activation step including the cleavage of a B-C bond one molecule of H2O2 is consumed that counteracts the desired effect of the products released from aminoferrocenes. We replaced an H2O2-sensitive trigger in original prodrugs with an azide group. This trigger is slowly reduced in the presence of glutathione with the formation of an unstable arylamine intermediate, which decomposes with the release of iron ions and iminoquinone methides. These products induce strong oxidative stress in cells as we confirmed using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate reagent in combination with flow cytometry. In this case the activation process does not consume H2O2. Correspondingly, we observed that the azide-containing prodrug is substantially more toxic towards human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 (IC50=27+/-4muM) than its H2O2-responsive analogue (IC50>50muM).",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has recently been implicated to be a drug target for this subtype of leukemia. More studies using potent LSD1 inhibitors against MLL-rearranged leukemia are needed. METHODS: LSD1 inhibitors were examined for their biochemical and biological activities against LSD1 and MLL-rearranged leukemia as well as other cancer cells. RESULTS: Potent LSD1 inhibitors with biochemical IC50 values of 9.8-77 nM were found to strongly inhibit proliferation of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells with EC50 of 10-320 nM, while these compounds are generally non-cytotoxic to several other tumor cells. LSD1 inhibition increased histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, downregulated expression of several leukemia-relevant genes, induced apoptosis and differentiation, and inhibited self-renewal of stem-like leukemia cells. Moreover, LSD1 inhibitors worked synergistically with inhibition of DOT1L, a histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, against MLL-rearranged leukemia. The most potent LSD1 inhibitor showed significant in vivo activity in a systemic mouse model of MLL-rearranged leukemia without overt toxicities. Mechanistically, LSD1 inhibitors caused significant upregulation of several pathways that promote hematopoietic differentiation and apoptosis.

METHODS: The study's key outcome was the life-time incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (euro/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) with an annual 3% discounting. A probabilistic Markov model with 3 health states (progression-free, progression, and death) was developed. Survival time was modeled based on age-matched clinical data by using appropriate survival distributions. Each health state was assigned an EuroQoL-5D-3L quality-of-life estimate and Finnish payer costs according to treatment received, and Binet stage of disease; severe adverse events and treatment inconvenience were also included. Six approaches considered the risk and value of key outcomes: cost-effectiveness efficiency frontiers; Bayesian treatment ranking (BTR) rated the lowest ICERs and best QALY gains; the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier demonstrated optimal treatment; expected value of perfect information; and the cost-benefit assessment (CBA), a type of clinical value analysis, increased the clinical interpretation and appeal of modeled outcomes by including both relative and absolute (impact investment [benefit obtained with a fixed limited budget]) benefit assessments. FINDINGS: The ICERs compared with chlorambucil varied from euro29,334 with obinutuzumab + chlorambucil to euro82,159 with ofatumumab + chlorambucil. Based on the BTR of ICERs versus chlorambucil, obinutuzumab + chlorambucil was the most cost-effective with 93% probability; rituximab + chlorambucil was the second most cost-effective (73%); and rituximab + bendamustine was the third most cost-effective (65%). The ICERs of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil were euro20,038, euro11,556, and euro15,586 compared with rituximab + chlorambucil, rituximab + bendamustine, and ofatumumab + chlorambucil. Obinutuzumab + chlorambucil was the most cost-effective treatment, with 54% and 99% probability at euro30,000 and euro50,000/QALY gained, respectively. The corresponding expected values of perfect information were euro1438 and euro44 per patient. Based on the BTR of QALYs gained, obinutuzumab + chlorambucil was the most effective, with 100% probability; rituximab + chlorambucil was the second most effective (56%); and rituximab + bendamustine was the third most effective treatment (81%). Results were robust in sensitivity analyses. For obinutuzumab + chlorambucil, the CBA demonstrated the best clinical value-to-cost-effectiveness relation and the longest time progression-free with a limited budget. IMPLICATIONS: The mean results were sensitive to large changes in time horizon, indirect comparison hazard ratios, survival distributions, and discounting; however, obinutuzumab + chlorambucil provided considerable effectiveness and best value for money among chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients unsuitable to receive full doses of fludarabine. In this case, CBA concurred with the key outcome of the study. However, the CBA cannot fully substitute the key outcome, and further cost-effectiveness studies with different cancer types are needed to assess the validity of a limited CBA.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Patients responding to rituximab weekly x 4 were randomized to MR (single dose rituximab every 3 months until treatment failure) or RR (rituximab weekly x 4) at the time of each progression until treatment failure. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure (TTTF). Patients with SLL (n = 57), MZL (n = 71) and unclassifiable small B-cell lymphoma (n = 3) received induction rituximab. The overall response rate (ORR) was 40% [95% confidence interval (CI) 31-49%; SLL ORR 22.8%; MZL ORR 52.1%]; all 52 responders were randomized.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have failed to find a beneficial effect of escalating immunosuppression using additional agents. Considering the small number of RCTs, limited sample sizes, and frequent early termination because of anticipated futility, we conducted a systematic review and an aggregate data meta-analysis to explore whether a true efficacy signal has been missed because of the limitations of individual RCTs. Seven reports met our inclusion criteria. The control arm in all studies was 2 mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent). The additional agent(s) used in the experimental arm(s) were higher-dose steroids, antithymocyte globulin, infliximab, anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibody (daclizumab and BT563), CD5-specific immunotoxin, and mycophenolate mofetil. Random effects meta-analysis revealed no efficacy signal in pooled response rates at various times points. Overall survival at 100 days was significantly worse in the experimental arm (relative risk [RR], .83; 95% confidence interval [CI], .74 to .94; P = .004, data from 3 studies) and showed a similar trend (albeit not statistically significantly) at 1 year as well (RR, .86; 95% CI, .68 to 1.09; P = .21, data from 5 studies). In conclusion, these results argue against the value of augmented generic immunosuppression beyond steroids for frontline treatment of aGVHD and emphasize the importance of developing alternative strategies. Novel forms of immunomodulation and targeted therapies against non-immune-related pathways may enhance the efficacy of steroids in this setting, and early predictive and prognostic biomarkers can help identify the subgroup of patients who would likely need treatments other than (or in addition to) generic immunosuppression.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Also, no direct comparisons have been published with current standard of care, combination of antithymocyte globulin (ATG), calcineurin inhibitors, and either methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Eighty-six adult patients (median age 34 years; range, 18 to 59) with acute myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukemia underwent unrelated PBSC transplantation with PTCy, tacrolimus, and MMF as GVHD prophylaxis in the single-center trial (clinicaltrial.govNCT02294552). The control group comprised 125 consecutive historical control patients who received ATG, tacrolimus, and methotrexate or MMF. Cumulative incidences of grades II to IV acute (19% versus 45%, P = .0003), grades III to IV acute (4% versus 27%, P < .0001), and chronic GVHD (16% versus 65%, P < .0001) were significantly lower in the PTCy compared with the ATG group. PTCy-based prophylaxis was associated with reduced incidence of nonrelapse mortality (16% versus 36%, P = .005; HR, .55; 95% CI, .34 to .89) and improved overall survival (69% versus 40%, P = .0007; HR, .43; 95% CI, .26 to .70), event-free survival (65% versus 38%, P = .0006; HR, .49; 95% CI, .31 to .78), and GVHD relapse-free survival (52% versus 12%, P < .0001). PTCy-based prophylaxis also had a better safety profile compared with ATG with reduced incidence of veno-occlusive disease, cytomegalovirus reactivation, invasive mycosis, and reduced severity of mucositis. In this study we demonstrated that PTCy in combination with tacrolimus and MMF is a safe and effective GVHD prophylaxis for unrelated PBSC transplantation. Although there are several limitations of the historical control approach, this study suggests the superiority of a PTCy-based approach over an ATG-based prophylaxis.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The trigger for IT was WT1 >/= 180 copies/10(4) Abelson cells in marrow cells in the first group of 122 patients (WT1-180) and >/= 100 copies in a subsequent group of 85 patients (WT1-100). Forty patients received IT. The cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse was 76% in WT1-180 (n = 17) versus 29% in WT1-100 patients (n = 23) receiving IT (P = .006); the leukemia-free survival from MRD positivity was 23% versus 74%, respectively (P = .003). We then looked at the entire AML patient population (n = 207). WT1-180 and WT1-100 patients were comparable for disease phase and age. The overall 4-year CI of transplantation-related mortality was 13% in both groups; the CI of leukemia relapse was 38% in the WT1-180 and 28% in the WT1-100 patients (P = .05) and leukemia-free survival was 56% versus 48%, respectively (P = .07). In conclusion, we suggests that WT1-based pre-emptive immunotherapy is feasible in patients with undergoing an allogeneic HSCT. The protective effect on relapse is greater when IT is triggered at lower levels of WT1.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

To further characterize molecular alterations of EZH2, and their potential prognostic impact in MDS, we assessed EZH2 RNA expression in primary bone marrow CD34+ cells from 78 patients. We found that 47% of patients have reduced EZH2 expression compared to normal controls. Further analyses revealed that EZH2 is significantly underexpressed in patients bearing chromosome 7 or 7q deletions (7-alt) when compared to controls, diploid patients, and patients with other cytogenetic alterations (p<0.05). In survival analysis, we found a non-significant trend toward overall survival (OS) being better among patients with EZH2 underexpression (median OS 55 vs. 36 months; p=0.71). Importantly, this trend became significant when the analysis was restricted to the subset of cases without alterations in chromosome 7 (62 vs. 36 months; p=0.033). Furthermore, our previous work has identified a spectrum of innate immune genes in MDS CD34+ cells that are deregulated via abnormal promoter histone methylation. Because EZH2 is a key regulator of histone methylation, we assessed the relationship between deregulation of these genes and EZH2 underexpression. We observed that the mRNA levels of 11 immune genes were higher in the EZH2 underexpression group and that immune gene expression was significantly higher in patients with concomitant EZH2 underexpression and KDM6B (also known as JMJD3, an H3K27 demethylase) overexpression. Taken together, these data indicate that EZH2 underexpression may have unique impact on the molecular pathogenesis and prognosis in MDS and be an important marker for patients without chromosome 7 alteration.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The term ""retinoid"" includes a handful of endogenous and a large group of synthetic derivatives of vitamin A. These multifunctional lipid-soluble compounds directly regulate target genes of specific biological functions and critical signaling pathways to orchestrate complex functions from vision to development, metabolism, and inflammation. Many of the retinoid activities on the cellular level have been well characterized and translated to the regulation of processes like differentiation and cell death, which play critical roles in the outcome of malignant transformation of tissues. In fact, retinoid-based differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia was one of the first successful examples of molecularly targeted treatment strategies. The selectivity, high receptor binding affinity and the ability of retinoids to directly modulate gene expression programs present a distinct pharmacological opportunity for cancer treatment and prevention. However, to fully exploit their potential, the adverse effects of retinoids must be averted. In this review we provide an overview of the biology of retinoid (activated by nuclear retinoic acid receptors [RARs]) and rexinoid (engaged by nuclear retinoid X receptors [RXRs]) action concluded from a long line of preclinical studies, in relation to normal and transformed states of cells. We will also discuss the past and current uses of retinoids in the treatment of malignancies, the potential of rexinoids in the cancer prevention setting, both as single agents and in combinations.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) B cells are characterized by almost no telomerase activity, shelterin deregulation and telomere fusions. To characterize telomeric maintenance mechanisms in B-CLL patients, we measured their telomere length, telomerase expression and the main hallmarks of the ALT activity i.e. C-circle concentration, an extra-chromosomal telomere repeat (ECTR), and the level of telomeric sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE) rate. Patients showed relative homogenous telomere length although almost no TERT transcript and nearly no C-circle were evidenced. Nevertheless, compared with normal B cells, B-CLL cells showed an increase in T-SCE rate that was correlated with a strong down-regulation of the topoisomerase III alpha (TOP3A) expression, involved in the dissolution of Holliday Junctions (HJ), together with an increased expression of SLX1A, SLX4, MUS81 and GEN1, involved in the resolution of HJ. Altogether, our results suggest that the telomere maintenance mechanism of B-CLL cells do not preferentially use telomerase or ALT. Rather, the rupture of the dissolvasome/resolvasome balance may increase telomere shuffling that could homogenize telomere length, slowing telomere erosion in this disease.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Medves, Sandrine', 'Auchter, Morgan', 'Chambeau, Laetitia', 'Gazzo, Sophie', 'Poncet, Delphine', 'Grangier, Blandine', 'Verney, Aurelie', 'Moussay, Etienne', 'Ammerlaan, Wim', 'Brisou, Gabriel', 'Morjani, Hamid', 'Geli, Vincent', 'Palissot, Valerie', 'Berchem, Guy', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Wenner, Thomas']","['Medves S', 'Auchter M', 'Chambeau L', 'Gazzo S', 'Poncet D', 'Grangier B', 'Verney A', 'Moussay E', 'Ammerlaan W', 'Brisou G', 'Morjani H', 'Geli V', 'Palissot V', 'Berchem G', 'Salles G', 'Wenner T']","['Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, LIH, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Cancer Research Centre Marseille CRCM, U1068 Inserm, UMR7258 CNRS, Aix-Marseille University, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer equipe labellisee, Marseille, France.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, LIH, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Equipe Proliferations B Indolentes, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, UMR CNRS 5239, Oullins Cedex, France.', 'Biochemistry Department, Transfer and Molecular Oncology Unit, Lyon Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, UCBL Lyon 1, Oullins cedex 12, France.', 'Biochemistry Department, Transfer and Molecular Oncology Unit, Lyon Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, UCBL Lyon 1, Oullins cedex 12, France.', 'Equipe Proliferations B Indolentes, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, UMR CNRS 5239, Oullins Cedex, France.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, LIH, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Core Facility Flow Cytometry, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante (CRP-Sante), Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Equipe Proliferations B Indolentes, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, UMR CNRS 5239, Oullins Cedex, France.', 'MEDyC, Unite CNRS UMR7369, UFR de Pharmacie, Reims, France.', 'Cancer Research Centre Marseille CRCM, U1068 Inserm, UMR7258 CNRS, Aix-Marseille University, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer equipe labellisee, Marseille, France.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, LIH, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, LIH, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Equipe Proliferations B Indolentes, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, UMR CNRS 5239, Oullins Cedex, France.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, LIH, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Equipe Proliferations B Indolentes, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, UMR CNRS 5239, Oullins Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160311,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Cruciform)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA, Cruciform', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Telomerase/analysis', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Telomere Homeostasis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*recombination', '*telomere', '*telomere maintenance mechanism', '*topoisomerase']",2016/03/13 06:00,2017/05/06 06:00,['2016/03/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13995 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Jul;174(1):57-70. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13995.

BMMSCs were isolated from femurs of three to four weeks old male NMRI mice, and the cells at passage three were treated with 2 microM 5-aza-dC for 72 hours. SSCs were isolated, cultured, and harvested at passage three to collect SSCS extract; BMMSCs were then incubated with SSCS extract in the three time periods: 72 hours, one week and two weeks. There were five groups: control, sham, extract, 5-aza-dC and extract-5-aza-dC. After one week of incubation, flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) exhibited high levels of expression for beta1- and alpha6-integrins and promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) in extract and extract-5-aza-dC groups (P < 0.05 vs. control and 5-aza-dC), and cells in these two groups had two forms of morphology, round and fusiform, similar to germ-like cells. 5-aza-dC had no significant effects during the three time periods of evaluation.

Epigenetic alterations, to this point, are largely identified by changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation as well as methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation of histone tails.

A very promising way to treat AML is differentiation therapy using either all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), or the use of both these differentiation-inducing agents. However, the effect of combination treatment varies in different AML cell lines, and this is due to ATRA either down- or up-regulating transcription of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the cells examined. The mechanism of transcriptional regulation of VDR in response to ATRA has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) is responsible for regulating VDR transcription in AML cells. We have shown that a VDR transcriptional variant, originating in exon 1a, is regulated by RARalpha agonists in AML cells. Moreover, in cells with a high basal level of RARalpha protein, the VDR gene is transcriptionally repressed as long as RARalpha agonist is absent. In these cells down-regulation of the level of RARalpha leads to increased expression of VDR. We consider that our findings provide a mechanistic background to explain the different outcomes from treating AML cell lines with a combination of ATRA and 1,25D.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

PURPOSE: We aimed to further determine the anti-cancer activity of diosgenin and its mechanisms in CML cells. METHODS: The cell vitality was detected by MTT assay. Autophagic flux and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscope. Apoptosis was observed by flow cytometry. All proteins expression was examined by western blotting. RESULTS: Autophagy induction was demonstrated by examination of autophagic flux including autophagosomes accumulation, autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation of autophagosomes. Moreover, blocking autophagy with inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), enhanced diosgenin-induced apoptosis, indicating the protective effect of autophagy in diosgenin-treated CML cells. Further study suggested that diosgenin-induced autophagy and cytotoxicity were accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway inhibition. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) administration, a scavenger agent of ROS, could down-regulate diosgenin-induced autophagy via reversion of mTOR pathway inhibition. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that diosgenin obviously generates ROS and this oxidative pressure not only produces cytotoxic effect on CML cells but also induces autophagy. What's more, autophagy functions as a cytoprotective mechanism to overcome cytotoxicity of diosgenin in tumor cells and inhibition of autophagy can enhance the anti-CML activity of diosgenin.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

An L.E.A. study.,747-56,10.3324/haematol.2015.140053 [doi],"Thyroid complications are known side effects of irradiation. However, the risk of such complications in childhood acute leukemia survivors who received either central nervous system irradiation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is less described. We prospectively evaluated the incidence and risk factors for thyroid dysfunction and tumors in survivors of childhood acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia. A total of 588 patients were evaluated for thyroid function, and 502 individuals were assessed for thyroid tumors (median follow-up duration: 12.6 and 12.5 years, respectively). The cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism was 17.3% (95% CI: 14.1-21.1) and 24.6% (95% CI: 20.4-29.6) at 10 and 20 years from leukemia diagnosis, respectively. Patients who received total body irradiation (with or without prior central nervous system irradiation) were at higher risk of hypothyroidism (adjusted HR: 2.87; P=0.04 and 2.79, P=0.01, respectively) as compared with transplanted patients who never received any irradiation. Patients transplanted without total body irradiation who received central nervous system irradiation were also at higher risk (adjusted HR: 3.39; P=0.02). Patients irradiated or transplanted at older than 10 years of age had a lower risk (adjusted HR: 0.61; P=0.02). Thyroid malignancy was found in 26 patients (5.2%). Among them, two patients had never received any type of irradiation: alkylating agents could also promote thyroid cancer. The cumulative incidence of thyroid malignancy was 9.6% (95% CI: 6.0-15.0) at 20 years. Women were at higher risk than men (adjusted HR: 4.74; P=0.002). In conclusion, thyroid complications are frequent among patients who undergo transplantation after total body irradiation and those who received prior central nervous system irradiation. Close monitoring is thus warranted for these patients.

Eight hundred and eighty three patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning were compared with 1041 myeloablative conditioning regimen recipients in the setting of mismatched unrelated donor transplantation. The donor graft was HLA-matched at 9/10 in 872 (83.8%) and at 8/10 in 169 (16.2%) myeloablative conditioning recipients, while in the reduced-intensity conditioning cohort, 754 (85.4%) and 129 (14.6%) were matched at 9/10 and 8/10 loci, respectively. Myeloablative conditioning regimen recipients were younger, 70% being <50 years of age compared to only 30% in the reduced-intensity conditioning group (P=0.0001). Significantly, more patients had secondary acute myeloid leukemia (P=0.04) and Karnofsky Performance Status score <90% (P=0.02) in the reduced-intensity conditioning group. Patients <50 and >/=50 years were analyzed separately. On multivariate analysis and after adjusting for differences between the two groups, reduced-intensity conditioning in patients age >/=50 years was associated with higher overall survival (HR 0.78; P=0.01), leukemia-free survival (HR 0.82; P=0.05), and decreased non-relapse mortality (HR 0.73; P=0.03). Relapse incidence (HR 0.91; P=0.51) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (HR 1.31; P=0.11) were, however, not significantly different. In patients <50 years old, there were no statistically significant differences in overall survival, leukemia-free survival, relapse incidence, non-relapse mortality, and chronic graft-versus-host-disease between the groups. Our study shows no significant outcome differences in patients younger than 50 years receiving reduced-intensity vs myeloablative conditioning regimens after mismatched unrelated donor transplantation. Furthermore, the data support the superiority of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens in older adults receiving transplants from mismatched unrelated donors.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Savani, Bipin N', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Glass, Bertram', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Gorin, Norbert Claude', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Savani BN', 'Labopin M', 'Kroger N', 'Finke J', 'Ehninger G', 'Niederwieser D', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Bunjes D', 'Glass B', 'Socie G', 'Ljungman P', 'Craddock C', 'Baron F', 'Ciceri F', 'Gorin NC', 'Esteve J', 'Schmid C', 'Giebel S', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA Acute Leukemia Working Party, EBMT Paris study office / CEREST-TC, France bipin.savani@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party, EBMT Paris study office / CEREST-TC, France Department of Haematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'University Hospital Eppendorf, Department of Stem cell Transplantation, Hamburg, Germany.', 'University of Freiburg, Department of Medicine -Hematology, Oncology, Germany.', 'Universitaetsklinikum Dresden, MedizinischeKlinik und Poliklinik I, Germany.', 'University Hospital Leipzig, Div.

We performed a monocentric retrospective study including all patients with hematological malignancy in a ten-year period, to identify factors related to the outcome for the whole cohort and for patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), neutropenia, or those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

In the pediatric population, however, data on palifermin treatment are limited. A phase I dose-escalation study of palifermin in pediatric patients with acute leukemias undergoing myeloablative HSCT with total body irradiation, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide was performed to determine a safe and tolerable dose and to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and efficacy of palifermin.

PK data showed no differences between the 3 age groups. Exposure did not increase with increase in dose. The maximum severity of OM (WHO grade 4) occurred in 6 patients (22%), none of whom was in the 80-mug/kg/day dosing group.

Monoclonal antibodies to PCNA, which block the DNA elongation process in vitro, have been developed. When these antibodies were transduced into cancer cells, they are able to inhibit the incorporation of nucleoside analogues. When co-delivered with anti-PCNA siRNA, the cells were flattened and the size of their nuclei increased by up to 3-fold, prior to cell death. Analysis of these nuclei by super-resolution microscopy revealed the presence of large numbers of phosphorylated histone H2AX foci. A senescence-like phenotype of the transduced cells was also observed upon delivery of the corresponding Fab molecules or following PCNA gene disruption or when the Fab fragment of an antibody that neutralises DNA polymerase alpha was used. Primary melanoma cells and leukaemia cells that are resistant to chemical inhibitors were similarly affected by these antibody treatments.

However, due to the diversity and complexity of the cellular and molecular compartments in the leukemic microenvironment, it is extremely difficult to dissect the role of each individual molecule or cell type in vivo. Here we established an in vitro system to dissect the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), stromal cells and endothelial cells in the growth of mouse myeloid tumor cells and B-lymphoma cells. We found that either LPS or bone marrow stromal cells as a feeder layer in culture is required for the proliferation of myeloid tumor cells. Surprisingly, the growth of myeloid leukemic cells on stromal cells is strongly inhibited when coupled with LPS in culture. This opposing effect of LPS, a complete switch from pro-proliferation to antitumor growth is due, at least in part, to the rapidly increased production of interleukin 12, Fas ligand and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 from stromal cells stimulated by LPS. These results demonstrate that LPS can either facilitate or attenuate tumor cell proliferation, thus changing the disease course of myeloid leukemias through its direct effect or modulation of the tumor microenvironment.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, no systemic therapy combined with radical prostatectomy has proven beneficial. This was in part due to a lack of effective systemic agents; however, there have been several advancements in the metastatic and castrate-resistant prostate cancer that might prove beneficial if given earlier in the natural history of the disease. For example, novel hormonal agents have recently been approved for castration-resistant prostate cancer with some early phase II neoadjuvant showing promise. Additionally, combination therapy with docetaxel-based chemohormonal has demonstrated a profound survival benefit in metastatic hormone-naive patients and might have a role in eliminating pre-existing ADT-resistant tumor cells in the neoadjuvant setting. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/Alliance 90203 trial has finished accrual and should answer the question as to whether neoadjuvant docetaxel-based chemohormonal therapy provides an advantage over prostatectomy alone.

Survival is poor after failure of these drugs; there is no approved second-line therapy. We compared the overall survival of patients receiving rigosertib and best supportive care with that of patients receiving best supportive care only in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with excess blasts after failure of azacitidine or decitabine treatment. METHODS: We did this randomised controlled trial at 74 hospitals and university medical centres in the USA and Europe. We enrolled patients with diagnosis of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1, RAEB-2, RAEB-t, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia based on local site assessment, and treatment failure with a hypomethylating drug in the past 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive rigosertib 1800 mg per 24 h via 72-h continuous intravenous infusion administered every other week or best supportive care with or without low-dose cytarabine. Randomisation was stratified by pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01241500. FINDINGS: From Dec 13, 2010, to Aug 15, 2013, we enrolled 299 patients: 199 assigned to rigosertib, 100 assigned to best supportive care. Median follow-up was 19.5 months (IQR 11.9-27.3). As of Feb 1, 2014, median overall survival was 8.2 months (95% CI 6.1-10.1) in the rigosertib group and 5.9 months (4.1-9.3) in the best supportive care group (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.67-1.14; p=0.33). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were anaemia (34 [18%] of 184 patients in the rigosertib group vs seven [8%] of 91 patients in the best supportive care group), thrombocytopenia (35 [19%] vs six [7%]), neutropenia (31 [17%] vs seven [8%]), febrile neutropenia (22 [12%] vs ten [11%]), and pneumonia (22 [12%] vs ten [11%]). 41 (22%) of 184 patients in the rigosertib group and 30 (33%) of 91 patients in the best supportive care group died due to adverse events and three deaths were attributed to rigosertib treatment. INTERPRETATION: Rigosertib did not significantly improve overall survival compared with best supportive care. A randomised phase 3 trial of rigosertib (NCT 02562443) is underway in specific subgroups of patients deemed to be at high risk, including patients with very high risk per the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System criteria.

METHODS: The experimental cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2013 to April 2015 after obtaining approval from the ethics committee of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Testicular sperm extractions of non-obstructive azoospermic patients were obtained from the Clinical Urology and Embryology, In Vitro Fertilization Department of Imam Khomeini Hospital. Spermatogonial stem cells and Sertoli cells, obtained from human testis biopsies by a two-step enzymatic digestion method, were purified using fluorescence- activated cell-sorting and daturastramonium-lectin, and were cultured separately. To investigate a more direct influential factor on colony formation, one control and two experimental groups were formed. Group 1 acted as the control in which spermatogonial stem cells were co-cultured with Sertoli cells alone. In group 2 they were co-cultured with Sertoli cells and growth factors such as leukaemia inhibitory factor, epidermal growth factor and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and in group 3 with Sertoli cells along with growth factors in the presence of collagen-coated dishes. Number and diameter of the colonies were evaluated after 7 weeks. RESULTS: Specimens obtained related to 21 patients. Number and diameter of the colonies in group 3 (18+/-2.6 and 276.6+/-45.5) were significantly more than both groups 1 (3.5+/-1 and D1:81.6+/-12) and group 2(11+/-2.2 and 165.2+/-32.5) (p<0.05 each). Also, the number and diameter of colony in group 2 were significantly better than the control group (p<0.05).Expression profile of the VASA, promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger (PLZF), Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) and integrin a6 (INTGa6) were detected in all groups. Based on cytochemical findings, OCT4 was expressed in the colonies of all three groups.

A qualitative serum hCG test was interpreted as positive; however, a quantitative serum hCG test was negative (<5IU/L). To further investigate this discrepancy, the sample was pretreated with heterophilic blocking reagent (HBR). Additionally, the sample was tested on other qualitative hCG devices composed of antibodies from different animal sources. Blocking reagent from an automated quantitative immunoassay was also tested for its ability to inhibit the heterophile antibody interference. RESULTS: The qualitative test result was negative after pretreatment with heterophilic blocking reagent. Other devices composed of antibodies from different animal sources also demonstrated mixed results with the patient's sample. Blocking reagent obtained from the automated quantitative assay inhibited the heterophile antibody interference in the patient's sample. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that positive serum point-of-care hCG results should be interpreted with caution and confirmed with a quantitative serum hCG immunoassay when clinical suspicion is raised.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2013 for use in combination with chlorambucil for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). AREAS COVERED: This article evaluates the safety of obinutuzumab in CLL patients, also addressing pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), clinical use and efficacy. Moreover, a comparison with other anti-CD20 MoAb is performed. The principal available studies on obinutuzumab are reviewed, focusing on CLL. A PubMed literature search (August 2002 to September 2015) was conducted using the terms obinutuzumab, GA101, anti-CD20 antibody, and CLL. EXPERT OPINION: Obinutuzumab, a third-generation anti-CD20 MoAb, is a safe and effective treatment for elderly patients who are un-fit for fludarabine-based regimen. Its use, proven in the CLL11 study and the results of many ongoing trials evaluating other obinutuzumab-based regimen can lead obinutuzumab to be a candidate to replace rituximab as the first-line treatment option.",,"['Reda, G', 'Orofino, N', 'Cassin, R', 'Sciume, M', 'Fattizzo, B', 'Cortelezzi, A']","['Reda G', 'Orofino N', 'Cassin R', 'Sciume M', 'Fattizzo B', 'Cortelezzi A']","[""a Oncohematology Department , Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan , Milano , Italy."", ""a Oncohematology Department , Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan , Milano , Italy."", ""a Oncohematology Department , Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan , Milano , Italy."", ""a Oncohematology Department , Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan , Milano , Italy."", ""a Oncohematology Department , Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan , Milano , Italy."", ""a Oncohematology Department , Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan , Milano , Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160407,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'obinutuzumab', 'safety']",2016/03/12 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/03/12 06:00'],"['2016/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740338.2016.1165665 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2016 Jun;15(6):865-73. doi: 10.1517/14740338.2016.1165665.

ON may damage the hip or knee joints and may lead to arthrosis requiring total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The aim of this study was to address the risk of TJA in patients with cancer, especially those treated for HLM, in a nationwide population-based setting. Material and methods All patients who had undergone TJA after cancer diagnosis between the years 2000 and 2012 were identified by linking the Arthroplasty Register and the Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of TJAs were calculated to assess whether patients with any cancer, but especially HLM, have increased risk for TJA when compared with the general population. Results In patients with HLM or other cancer, the overall SIRs were similar compared with the general population. However, in HLM patients under 50 years of age, the SIR was 7.6, and in patients under 35 years of age, it was 45.5. The corresponding SIRs in patients with other cancers were 3.6 and 6.6, respectively. The highest SIRs, including all age groups, were among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (SIR = 4.5) and acute myeloid leukemia (SIR = 1.9). Discussion HLMs imply an increased risk for TJA compared with the general population. The risk is especially high in patients younger than 50 years, regardless of the type of HLM. Young patients with HLM, as well as their healthcare providers, should be aware of the highly increased risk of skeletal complications requiring TJA.",,"['Niinimaki, Tuukka T', 'Ohtonen, Pasi', 'Harila-Saari, Arja H', 'Niinimaki, Riitta A']","['Niinimaki TT', 'Ohtonen P', 'Harila-Saari AH', 'Niinimaki RA']","['a Department of Surgery , Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu , Oulu , Finland ;', 'b Division of Operative Care and Medical Research Center Oulu , Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu , Oulu , Finland ;', ""c Department of Women's and Children's Health , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden ;"", 'd Department of Children and Adolescents , Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu , Oulu , Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160311,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/*statistics & numerical data', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hip Joint/pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Knee Joint/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteonecrosis/*epidemiology/etiology/surgery', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",,,,2016/03/12 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/03/12 06:00'],"['2016/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/0284186X.2015.1119884 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2016 May;55(5):567-71. doi: 10.3109/0284186X.2015.1119884.

Fingolimod is a known PP2A activator that inhibits multiple signalling pathways and has been used extensively in patients with multiple sclerosis and other indications. The initial positive results of PP2A activators in vitro and mouse models of AML are promising; however, its safety for use in AML has not been assessed. From human studies of fingolimod in other indications, it is possible to evaluate whether the safety and toxicity profile of the PP2A activators will allow their use in treating AML. A literature review was carried out to assess safety before the commencement of Phase I trials of the PP2A activator Fingolimod in AML. From human studies of fingolimod in other indications, it is possible to evaluate whether the safety and toxicity profile of the PP2A activators will allow their use in treating AML. A systematic review of published literature in Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library of critical reviews was carried out. International standards for the design and reporting of search strategies were followed. Search terms and medical subject headings used in trials involving PP2A activators as well as a specific search were performed for 'adverse events', 'serious adverse events', 'delays in treatment', ' side effects' and 'toxicity' for primary objectives. Database searches were limited to papers published in the last 12 years and available in English. The search yielded 677 articles. A total of 69 journal articles were identified as relevant and included 30 clinical trials, 24 review articles and 15 case reports. The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, back pain, influenza viral infections, nasopharyngitis and bronchitis. Specific safety concerns include monitoring of the heart rate and conduction at commencement of treatment as cardiotoxicity has been reported. There is little evidence to suggest specific bone marrow toxicity. Lymophopenia is a desired effect in the management of multiple sclerosis, but may have implications in patients with acute leukaemia as it may potentially increase susceptibility to viral infections such as influenza. Fingolimod is a potential treatment option for AML with an acceptable risk to benefit ratio, given its lack of bone marrow toxicity and the relatively low rate of serious side effects. As most patients with AML are elderly, specific monitoring for cardiac toxicity as well as infection would be required.",,"['Enjeti, Anoop K', ""D'Crus, Angel"", 'Melville, Kathleen', 'Verrills, Nicole M', 'Rowlings, Philip']","['Enjeti AK', ""D'Crus A"", 'Melville K', 'Verrills NM', 'Rowlings P']","['aHaematology Department, Calvary Mater Newcastle, Waratah bSchool of Medicine and Public Health cSchool of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle dHunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton ePathology North-Hunter fHunter Cancer Research Alliance, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Observational Studies as Topic']",PMC4881728,,,2016/03/12 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/03/12 06:00'],"['2016/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000358 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2016 Jul;27(6):560-8. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000358.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NRAS is a guanosine triphosphate-binding protein whose most well-characterized downstream effector is RAF, leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 signaling. Although there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapies for melanoma patients with a primary mutation in NRAS, one form of targeted therapy that has been explored is MEK inhibition. In clinical trials, MEK inhibitors have shown disappointing efficacy in mutant NRAS patients, the reasons for which are unclear. To explore the effects of MEK inhibitors in mutant NRAS melanoma, we used a high-throughput reverse-phase protein array platform to identify signaling alterations. Reverse-phase protein array analysis of phospho-proteomic changes in mutant NRAS melanoma in response to trametinib indicated a compensatory increase in v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog signaling and decreased expression of mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor/v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog receptors. MIG6 expression did not alter the growth or survival properties of mutant NRAS melanoma cells. Rather, we identified a role for MIG6 as a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor-induced signaling and cell migration and invasion. In MEK-inhibited cells, further depletion of MIG6 increased migration and invasion, whereas MIG6 expression decreased these properties. Therefore, a decrease in MIG6 may promote the migration and invasiveness of MEK-inhibited mutant NRAS melanoma, especially in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

AREAS COVERED: This review outlines the rationale for PARP inhibitor therapy in ovarian cancer and summarizes the efficacy and tolerability data for olaparib to date. Ongoing phase III clinical trials of olaparib in ovarian cancer will be discussed. EXPERT OPINION: There are a number of issues regarding the optimal use of olaparib in ovarian cancer, including the identification of a homologous recombination deficiency signature to predict treatment response, establishment of the optimal treatment setting (maintenance or relapsed disease), and evaluation of cost-effectiveness.

Patients were categorized into early blast clearance (EBC; </=5 days) and delayed blast clearance (DBC; >5 days) groups based on a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy was related to the time to clearance of PBB (p < 0.001). Relapse-free survival (RFS; p = 0.003) and overall survival (p < 0.001) were longer in the EBC group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the time to clearance of PBB and cytogenetic risk independently predicted CR and RFS.

Only dephosphorylated cofilin could translocate to mitochondria during cerulenin-induced apoptosis. Disruption of the ROCK1/Akt/JNK signaling pathway plays a critical role in the cerulenin-mediated dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and apoptosis. In vivo studies demonstrated that cerulenin-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of leukemia was associated with mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and apoptosis. These data are consistent with a hierarchical model in which induction of apoptosis by cerulenin primarily results from activation of ROCK1, inactivation of Akt, and activation of JNK. This leads to the dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and culminates with cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis.

Overexpression of RalA results in malignant transformation and progression, and induces resistance to imatinib (IM) in BaF3 and K562 cell lines. RalA reduced survival and led to IM resistance in a xenografted mouse model. Ablation of RalA by either siRNA or miR-181a, a RalA targeting microRNA, attenuated the malignant phenotypes in K562 cells. RBC8, a selective Ral inhibitor, enhanced the inhibitory effects of IM in K562, KCL22 and BaF3-P210 cells.

Thus, we evaluated the role of the Notch pathway in the proliferation, survival and chemoresistance of AML cells in co-culture with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells expanded from both healthy donors (hBM-MSCs) and AML patients (hBM-MSCs*). As compared to hBM-MSCs, hBM-MSCs* showed higher level of Notch1, Jagged1 as well as the main Notch target gene HES1. Notably, hBM-MSCs* induced expression and activation of Notch signalling in AML cells, supporting AML proliferation and being more efficientin inducing AML chemoresistance than hBM-MSCs*. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch using combinations of Notch receptor-blocking antibodies or gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), in presence of chemotherapeutic agents, significant lowered the supportive effect of hBM-MSCs and hBM-MSCs* towards AML cells, by activating apoptotic cascade and reducing protein level of STAT3, AKT and NF-kappaB.These results suggest that Notch signalling inhibition, by overcoming the stromal-mediated promotion of chemoresistance,may represent a potential therapeutic targetnot only for lymphoid neoplasms, but also for AML.",,"['Takam Kamga, Paul', 'Bassi, Giulio', 'Cassaro, Adriana', 'Midolo, Martina', 'Di Trapani, Mariano', 'Gatti, Alessandro', 'Carusone, Roberta', 'Resci, Federica', 'Perbellini, Omar', 'Gottardi, Michele', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Nwabo Kamdje, Armel Herve', 'Ambrosetti, Achille', 'Krampera, Mauro']","['Takam Kamga P', 'Bassi G', 'Cassaro A', 'Midolo M', 'Di Trapani M', 'Gatti A', 'Carusone R', 'Resci F', 'Perbellini O', 'Gottardi M', 'Bonifacio M', 'Nwabo Kamdje AH', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Krampera M']","['Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', ""Division of Hematology, Ca' Foncello Hospital, Treviso, Italy."", 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ngaoundere-Cameroon, Cameroon.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Notch/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",PMC5008317,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'MSC', 'Notch', 'chemoresistance']",2016/03/12 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2016/03/12 06:00'],"['2016/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]']","['7964 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7964 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Apr 19;7(16):21713-27. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7964.,,,,,,,['The authors report no potential conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We review preclinical and clinical data during the development mitoxantrone, an anthracycline, for the treatment of MS; benefits and potential risks; and strategies to reduce complications of anthracyclines. RESULTS: Mitoxantrone had unacceptable and greater-than-anticipated toxicity for use in a chronic disease such as MS. Adverse effects included cardiotoxicity, treatment-associated leukemia, and amenorrhea. Toxicity was identified primarily in retrospect. Structurally related compounds include pixantrone (BBR2278) and BBR3378. Pixantrone is in clinical development in oncology. BBR3378 prevents the development of autoimmunity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and blocks experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis even when given after the onset of autoimmunity. CONCLUSIONS: There remains a need for effective MS treatment, particularly for nonrelapsing forms of MS. Mitoxantrone was the first nonbiologic drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in MS. Chromophore modification of anthracenedione agents yielded a novel class of DNA binding agents (aza-anthracenediones such as pixantrone and aza-anthrapyrazoles such as BBR3378) with the potential for less cardiotoxicity compared with mitoxantrone. There is a need for long-term observation for delayed toxicity among humans enrolled in pixantrone trials. Preclinical toxicity studies for delayed toxicities in rodents and other models are warranted before consideration of derivatives of anthracenediones, aza-anthrazenediones, or aza-anthrapyrazoles for use in human MS clinical trials.",,"['Koffman, Boyd M', 'Hacker, Miles', 'Gunning, William T 3rd', 'Quinn, Anthony']","['Koffman BM', 'Hacker M', 'Gunning WT 3rd', 'Quinn A']","['Departments of *Neurology, daggerPharmacology, double daggerPathology, section signBiological Sciences, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Neuropharmacol,Clinical neuropharmacology,7607910,['0 (Anthraquinones)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy']",,,,2016/03/12 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/12 06:00'],"['2016/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/WNF.0000000000000137 [doi]', '00002826-201603000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Neuropharmacol. 2016 Mar-Apr;39(2):102-11. doi: 10.1097/WNF.0000000000000137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (igrt) has been shown to reduce the frequency of bacterial infections and associated hospitalizations in patients with hgg or a history of infection, or both. However, use of igrt in cll is contentious. Studies examining such treatment were conducted largely before the use of newer chemoimmunotherapies, which can extend lifespan, but do not correct the hgg inherent to the disease. Thus, the utility of igrt has to be re-evaluated in the current setting.

During leukemic progression, immature T cells grow abnormally and crowd into the bone marrow, preventing it from making normal blood cells and spilling out into the bloodstream. Recent studies suggest that only discrete cell populations that possess the ability to recreate the entire tumour might be responsible for the initiation and propagation of t-all. Those unique cells are commonly called ""cancer stem cells"" or, in the case of hematopoietic malignancies, ""leukemia stem cells"" (lscs). Like normal hematopoietic stem cells, lscs are thought to be capable of self-renewal, during which, by asymmetrical division, they give rise to an identical copy of themselves as well as to a daughter cell that is no longer capable of self-renewal activity and represents a more ""differentiated"" progeny. Here, we review the main pathways of self-renewal activity in lscs, focusing on their involvement in the maintenance and development of t-all.

Here we show that MYC regulates the expression of two immune checkpoint proteins on the tumor cell surface: the innate immune regulator CD47 (cluster of differentiation 47) and the adaptive immune checkpoint PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1). Suppression of MYC in mouse tumors and human tumor cells caused a reduction in the levels of CD47 and PD-L1 messenger RNA and protein. MYC was found to bind directly to the promoters of the Cd47 and Pd-l1 genes. MYC inactivation in mouse tumors down-regulated CD47 and PD-L1 expression and enhanced the antitumor immune response. In contrast, when MYC was inactivated in tumors with enforced expression of CD47 or PD-L1, the immune response was suppressed, and tumors continued to grow. Thus, MYC appears to initiate and maintain tumorigenesis, in part, through the modulation of immune regulatory molecules.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Casey, Stephanie C', 'Tong, Ling', 'Li, Yulin', 'Do, Rachel', 'Walz, Susanne', 'Fitzgerald, Kelly N', 'Gouw, Arvin M', 'Baylot, Virginie', 'Gutgemann, Ines', 'Eilers, Martin', 'Felsher, Dean W']","['Casey SC', 'Tong L', 'Li Y', 'Do R', 'Walz S', 'Fitzgerald KN', 'Gouw AM', 'Baylot V', 'Gutgemann I', 'Eilers M', 'Felsher DW']","['Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Core Unit Bioinformatics, Biocenter, University of Wurzburg, Am Hubland, 97074 Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

However, patients develop resistance when the disease progresses to the blast phase (BP) and the mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that BCR-ABL activates BLT2 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to promote leukemogenesis and this involves the p53 signaling pathway. Compared to normal bone marrow (NBM), the mRNA and protein levels of BLT2 are significantly increased in BP-CML CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells. This is correlated with increasing BCR-ABL expression. In contrast, knockdown of BCR-ABL or inhibition of its tyrosine kinase activity decreases Blt2 protein level. BLT2 inhibition induces apoptosis, inhibits proliferation, colony formation and self-renewal capacity of CD34(+) cells from TKI-resistant BP-CML patients. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of BCR-ABL TKI on CML stem/progenitor cells are further enhanced upon combination with BLT2 inhibition. We further show that BLT2 activation selectively suppresses p53 but not Wnt or BMP-mediated luciferase activity and transcription. Our results demonstrate that BLT2 is a novel pathway activated by BCR-ABL and critically involved in the resistance of BP-CML CD34(+) stem/progenitors to TKIs treatment. Our findings suggest that BLT2 and p53 can serve as therapeutic targets for CML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

NudC is conserved from fungi to mammals. Vertebrate NudC has three homologs: NudC, NudC-like protein (NudCL), and NudC-like protein 2 (NudCL2). All members of the NudC family share a conserved p23 domain, which possesses chaperone activity both in conjunction with and independently of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Our group and the others found that NudC homologs were involved in cell cycle regulation by stabilizing the components of the LIS1/dynein complex. Additionally, NudC plays important roles in cell migration, ciliogenesis, thrombopoiesis, and the inflammatory response. It has been reported that NudCL is essential for the stability of the dynein intermediate chain and ciliogenesis via its interaction with the dynein 2 complex. Our data showed that NudCL2 regulates the LIS1/dynein pathway by stabilizing LIS1 with Hsp90 chaperone. The fourth distantly related member of the NudC family, CML66, a tumor-associated antigen in human leukemia, contains a p23 domain and appears to promote oncogenesis by regulating the IGF-1R-MAPK signaling pathway. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the NudC family and highlight its potential clinical relevance.",,"['Fu, Qiqin', 'Wang, Wei', 'Zhou, Tianhua', 'Yang, Yuehong']","['Fu Q', 'Wang W', 'Zhou T', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Cell Biology and Program in Molecular Cell Biology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Program in Molecular Cell Biology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Program in Molecular Cell Biology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, China. tzhou@zju.edu.cn.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, 310003, China. tzhou@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Program in Molecular Cell Biology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, China. yhyang@zju.edu.cn.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, 310003, China. yhyang@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160311,China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

Concomitant use after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) may therefore result in a pharmacokinetic interaction. Although case reports and a recent small study in children indeed suggested there is a relevant pharmacokinetic interaction, a larger study in adults is lacking. In this study, we assessed the presence and extent of this interaction in patients with CML or Ph+ ALL undergoing HSCT. METHODS: From a large database containing data of all patients receiving HSCT in our center between 2005 and 2015, we selected 16 patients using this drug combination. The average dose-corrected CsA concentration was calculated before and after initiation of imatinib. RESULTS: The average dose-corrected CsA concentration increased during imatinib use in all patients, on average by 94 % (p < 0.001). Based on measured drug concentrations, the CsA dosage needed to be reduced, on average, by 27 % after initiation of imatinib (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib significantly increases CsA concentrations in HSCT patients, putting these patients at increased risk of CsA toxicity. We recommend intensive monitoring of CsA concentrations after initiation of imatinib; a pre-emptive CsA dose reduction of 25 % might be considered.",,"['Atiq, Ferdows', 'Broers, Annoek E C', 'Andrews, Louise M', 'Doorduijn, Jeanette K', 'Koch, Birgit C P', 'Van Gelder, Teun', 'Versmissen, Jorie']","['Atiq F', 'Broers AE', 'Andrews LM', 'Doorduijn JK', 'Koch BC', 'Van Gelder T', 'Versmissen J']","['Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center, PO Box 2040, 3000, CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center, PO Box 2040, 3000, CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. j.versmissen@erasmusmc.nl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160311,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC4865545,['NOTNLM'],"['Cyclosporine', 'Graft-versus-host disease', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Imatinib']",2016/03/12 06:00,2016/03/12 06:01,['2016/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00228-016-2038-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00228-016-2038-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2016 Jun;72(6):719-23. doi: 10.1007/s00228-016-2038-9.

Aberrant Ras activation because of NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, CBL and NF1 mutations is common in CMML and JMML. However, no mechanism-based treatments currently exist for cancers with any of these mutations. An alternative therapeutic strategy involves targeting Ras-regulated effector pathways that are aberrantly activated in CMML and JMML, which include the Raf/MEK/ERK and phosphoinositide-3'-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt cascades. Mx1-Cre, Kras(D12) and Mx1-Cre, Nf1(flox/)(-) mice accurately model many aspects of CMML and JMML. Treating Mx1-Cre, Kras(D12) mice with GDC-0941 (also referred to as pictilisib), an orally bioavailable inhibitor of class I PI3K isoforms, reduced leukocytosis, anemia and splenomegaly while extending survival. However, GDC-0941 treatment attenuated activation of both PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways in primary hematopoietic cells, suggesting it could be acting through suppression of Raf/MEK/ERK signals. To interrogate the importance of the PI3K/Akt pathway specifically, we treated mice with the allosteric Akt inhibitor MK-2206. This compound had no effect on Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, yet it also induced robust hematologic responses in Kras and Nf1 mice with MPN.

Transplantation of MIM(-/-) BM cells into lethally irradiated mice showed enhanced homing to BM, which was abolished when mice were pretreated with a p38 antagonist. Interestingly, MIM(-/-) BM cells, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), showed two- to fivefold increase in mobilization into the peripheral blood upon treatment with AMD3100. In vitro, MIM(-/-) leukocytes were susceptible to AMD3100 and maintained increased response to AMD3100 for mobilization even after transfer into WT mice.

Young patients have long life expectancies and low morbidity with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Prolonged tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use may cause significant morbidity. In addition, indication for HCT in patients in the first chronic phase is not established. We hence retrospectively evaluated outcomes in 449 CML patients with early disease receiving myeloablative HCT reported to the CIBMTR. We analyzed various factors affecting outcome, specifically the effect of age and pre-HCT TKI in pediatric patients (age < 18 years, n = 177) and young adults (age 18 to 29 years, n = 272) with the goal of identifying prognostic factors. Post-HCT probability rates of 5-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 75% and 59%, respectively. Rates of OS and LFS were 76% and 57% in <18-year and 74% and 60% in 18- to 29-year group, respectively, by univariate analysis (P = .1 and = .6). Five-year rates of OS for HLA matched sibling donor (MSD) and bone marrow (BM) stem cell source were 83% and 80%, respectively. In multivariate analysis there was no effect of age (<18 versus 18 to 29) or pre-HCT TKI therapy on OS, LFS, transplant related mortality, or relapse. Favorable factors for OS were MSD (P < .001) and recent HCT (2003 to 2010; P = .04). LFS was superior with MSD (P < .001), BM as graft source (P = .001), and performance scores > 90 (P = .03) compared with unrelated or mismatched peripheral blood stem cells donors and recipients with lower performance scores. Older age was associated with increased incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (P = .0002). In the current era, HCT outcomes are similar in young patients and children with early CML, and best outcomes are achieved with BM grafts and MSD.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

Here, we refined the genetic basis underlying the functional effects of a CYP3A haplotype on urinary estrone glucuronide (E1G) levels and tested for an association between CYP3A genotype and outcome in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast, or lung cancers. The most significantly associated SNP was rs45446698, an SNP that tags the CYP3A7*1C allele; this SNP was associated with a 54% decrease in urinary E1G levels. Genotyping this SNP in 1,008 breast cancer, 1,128 lung cancer, and 347 CLL patients, we found that rs45446698 was associated with breast cancer mortality (HR, 1.74; P = 0.03), all-cause mortality in lung cancer patients (HR, 1.43; P = 0.009), and CLL progression (HR, 1.62; P = 0.03). We also found borderline evidence of a statistical interaction between the CYP3A7*1C allele, treatment of patients with a cytotoxic agent that is a CYP3A substrate, and clinical outcome (Pinteraction = 0.06). The CYP3A7*1C allele, which results in adult expression of the fetal CYP3A7 gene, is likely to be the functional allele influencing levels of circulating endogenous sex hormones and outcome in these various malignancies.

However, clinical trials have been disappointing in part to dose-limiting hypercalcemia. Here we show how inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) can improve the differentiation response of AML cells to 1,25D-mediated differentiation. GSK3 inhibition in AML cells enhanced the differentiating effects of low concentrations of 1,25D. In addition, GSK3 inhibition augmented the ability of 1,25D to induce irreversible growth inhibition and slow the progression of AML in mouse models. Mechanistic studies revealed that GSK3 inhibition led to the hyperphosphorylation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), enabling an interaction between VDR and the coactivator, SRC-3 (NCOA3), thereby increasing transcriptional activity. We also found that activation of JNK-mediated pathways in response to GSK3 inhibition contributed to the potentiation of 1,25D-induced differentiation. Taken together, our findings offer a preclinical rationale to explore the repositioning of GSK3 inhibitors to enhance differentiation-based therapy for AML treatment. Cancer Res; 76(9); 2743-53.

MiHAs with hematopoiesis-restricted expression are relevant targets to augment antitumor immunity after alloSCT without side effects. To identify therapeutic MiHAs, we analyzed the in vivo immune response in a patient with strong antitumor immunity after alloSCT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: T-cell clones recognizing patient, but not donor, hematopoietic cells were selected for MiHA discovery by whole genome association scanning. RNA-sequence data from the GEUVADIS project were analyzed to investigate alternative transcripts, and expression patterns were determined by microarray analysis and qPCR. T-cell reactivity was measured by cytokine release and cytotoxicity. RESULTS: T-cell clones were isolated for two HLA-B*15:01-restricted MiHA. LB-GLE1-1V is encoded by a nonsynonymous SNP in exon 6 of GLE1 For the other MiHAs, an associating SNP in intron 3 of ITGB2 was found, but no SNP disparity was present in the normal gene transcript between patient and donor. RNA-sequence analysis identified an alternative ITGB2 transcript containing part of intron 3. qPCR demonstrated that this transcript is restricted to hematopoietic cells and SNP-positive individuals. In silico translation revealed LB-ITGB2-1 as HLA-B*15:01-binding peptide, which was validated as hematopoietic MiHA by T-cell experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome and transcriptome analysis identified LB-ITGB2-1 as MiHAs encoded by an alternative transcript. Our data support the therapeutic relevance of LB-ITGB2-1 and illustrate the value of RNA-sequence analysis for discovery of immune targets encoded by alternative transcripts.

Mouse G6 (MuG6) is an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody discovered in a screen against rheumatoid factors (RFs) that binds with high affinity to an idiotope expressed on the 51p1 alleles of IGHV1-69 germline gene encoded antibodies (G6-id(+)). The finding that unmutated IGHV1-69 encoded BCRs are frequently expressed on B-CLL cells provides an opportunity for anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody immunotherapy. In this study, we first showed that MuG6 can deplete B cells encoding IGHV1-69 BCRs using a novel humanized GTL mouse model. Next, we humanized MuG6 and demonstrated that the humanized antibodies (HuG6s), especially HuG6.3, displayed approximately 2-fold higher binding affinity for G6-id(+) antibody compared to the parental MuG6. Additional studies showed that HuG6.3 was able to kill G6-id(+) BCR expressing cells and patient B-CLL cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Finally, both MuG6 and HuG6.3 mediate in vivo depletion of B-CLL cells in NSG mice.

Dectin-1, a C-type lectin family member represents one of the most important pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Dectin-1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of infectious complications. We sought to investigate the impact of three different Dectin-1 SNPs and one TLR2 SNP on developing IFD in 186 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML following anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genotyping of Dectin-1 SNPs (rs16910526, rs3901533 and rs7309123) and TLR2 SNP (rs5743708) was performed by TaqMan method and pyrosequencing. IFD was defined according to the EORTC/MSG consensus guidelines. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to evaluate the association between the polymorphisms and the occurrence of pulmonary infections. Dectin-1 expression studies with SNP genotyped human monocytes were performed to elucidate susceptibility to IFD following chemotherapy. RESULTS: We could demonstrate that patients carrying the Dectin-1 SNP rs7309123 G/G (n = 47) or G/G and C/G (n = 133) genotype revealed a significant higher risk for developing both pneumonia in general (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.5; p = 0.014 and OR: 3.0, p = 0.004) and pulmonary IFD (OR: 2.6; p = 0.012 and OR: 2.4, p = 0.041, respectively). Patients carrying the TLR2 SNP rs5743708 (R753Q, GA/AA genotype, n = 12) also revealed a significantly higher susceptibility to pneumonia including IFD. Furthermore, Dectin-1 mRNA expression in human monocytes was lower following chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: To our best knowledge, this study represents the first analysis demonstrating that harbouring polymorphisms of Dectin-1 (rs7309123) or TLR2 (rs5743708) represents an independent risk factor of developing IFD in patients with AML undergoing induction chemotherapy.",,"['Fischer, Mike', 'Spies-Weisshart, Baerbel', 'Schrenk, Karin', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Wittig, Susan', 'Glaser, Anita', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Scholl, Sebastian', 'Schnetzke, Ulf']","['Fischer M', 'Spies-Weisshart B', 'Schrenk K', 'Gruhn B', 'Wittig S', 'Glaser A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Scholl S', 'Schnetzke U']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160310,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CLEC7A protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/biosynthesis/*genetics']",PMC4786091,,,2016/03/11 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2016/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0150632 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-55135 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Mar 10;11(3):e0150632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0150632. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stent implantation have become increasingly popular, and these advancements have allowed patients to receive repetitive treatments for restenosis. However, these advancements also significantly increase radiation exposure that may lead to higher cumulative doses of radiation. In the present study, a nationwide population-based case-controlled study was used to explore the risk of leukemia after cardiac angiographic fluoroscopic intervention.A total of 5026 patients with leukemia and 100,520 control patients matched for age and sex (1:20) by a propensity score method without any cancer history were enrolled using the Registry Data for Catastrophic Illness and the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan between 2008 and 2010. All subjects were retrospectively surveyed (from year 2000) to determine receipt of cardiac fluoroscopic interventions. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression models, and estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval).After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, PTCA was found to be associated with an increased risk of leukemia with an adjusted OR of 1.566 (95% CI, 1.282-1.912), whereas coronary angiography alone without PTCA and cardiac electrophysiologic study were not. Our results also showed that an increased frequency of PTCA and coronary angiography was associated with a higher risk of leukemia (adjusted OR: 1.326 to 1.530 [all P < 0.05]).

Guidelines do exist for patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), but they provide broad timeframes for initiating vaccination; there is no standard schedule. The optimal approach to immunization in these populations is unclear. We sought to describe immunization practices at Canadian Pediatric Hematology/Oncology centers. A 43-item online questionnaire was distributed to the 16 programs in the C(17) research network of pediatric hematology/oncology centers to capture information on timing and criteria for immunization of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and those who have undergone HSCT. At each center, 1-2 physicians or pharmacists completed the survey to reflect center-wide immunization practices. Responses were received from 11/16 (69%) programs; 11 respondents reported on practices for patients with ALL and 9 reported on practices for patients who are post-HSCT. In 5/11 ALL programs (45%) re-immunization is recommended routinely after chemotherapy, starting 3-6 months post-chemotherapy. In HSCT programs, timing of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) varied from 3 months post-HSCT (4 programs) to 12 months post-HSCT (4 programs). Live vaccines were administered 24 months post-HSCT in 8/9 programs. All HSCT programs considered graft-versus-host-disease and 7 considered discontinuation of immunosuppression in immunization decisions. Pediatric hematology/oncology programs were divided in regards to re-immunization of patients with ALL post-chemotherapy. After HSCT, timing of PCV administration varied, with 4 programs initiating immunization later than Canadian guidelines recommend (3-9 months post-HSCT).

Indeed, previous studies using gene-targeted mice revealed that BCL-XL, but surprisingly not BCL-2, is critical for the development of c-MYC-induced pre-B/B lymphomas. However, it remains unclear whether another pro-survival BCL-2 relative contributes to their development. MCL-1 is an intriguing candidate, because it is required for cell survival during early B-lymphocyte differentiation. It is expressed abnormally high in several types of human B-cell lymphomas and is implicated in their resistance to chemotherapy. To test the B-cell intrinsic requirement for endogenous MCL-1 in lymphoma development, we conditionally deleted Mcl-1 in B-lymphoid cells of Emu-Myc transgenic mice. We found that MCL-1 loss in early B-lymphoid progenitors delayed MYC-driven lymphomagenesis. Moreover, the lymphomas that arose when MCL-1 levels were diminished appeared to have been selected for reduced levels of BIM and/or increased levels of BCL-XL. These results underscore the importance of MCL-1 in lymphoma development and show that alterations in the levels of other cell death regulators can compensate for deficiencies in MCL-1 expression.",,"['Grabow, S', 'Kelly, G L', 'Delbridge, A R D', 'Kelly, P N', 'Bouillet, P', 'Adams, J M', 'Strasser, A']","['Grabow S', 'Kelly GL', 'Delbridge AR', 'Kelly PN', 'Bouillet P', 'Adams JM', 'Strasser A']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160310,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4823944,,,2016/03/11 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2016/03/11 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201643 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.43 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Mar 10;7:e2132. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.43.,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0467-7871'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with PTCL (age >/= 15 years; 2000 to 2012) were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic white, or American Indian/Alaskan native. Age-standardized annual incidence rates and incidence rate ratios were estimated with 95% CIs, and case-case odds ratios were estimated by race/ethnicity using polytomous regression. Survival was estimated from SEER follow-up data with Cox regression. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand one hundred seven patients with PTCL were identified. Annual PTCL incidence was highest in blacks and lowest in Native Americans. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, blacks had a higher incidence of PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and a lower incidence of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL); Asians/Pacific Islanders had a higher incidence of AITL, extranodal nasal-type natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and NK-cell leukemia (ENKCL), and ATLL and a lower incidence of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma; Hispanics had a higher incidence of AITL and ENKCL; and Native Americans had a lower incidence of PTCL-NOS (all P < .05). The ratio of ENKCL to PCTL-NOS among Native Americans, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic whites was approximately three- to four-fold the same ratio among non-Hispanic whites. Survival varied significantly by race/ethnicity (P < .001), with blacks in particular experiencing shorter survival for most subtypes. CONCLUSION: Striking variation in incidence, proportions of PTCL subtypes, and survival was observed. Aspects of these PTCL subtype patterns, such as for ENKCL and ATLL, were similar to corresponding global populations. Despite the small population size and limited number of Native American patients, PTCL subtype frequencies in this group were distinct but most similar to Hispanic whites. Survival disparities were evident, especially for blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Adams, Scott V', 'Newcomb, Polly A', 'Shustov, Andrei R']","['Adams SV', 'Newcomb PA', 'Shustov AR']","['Scott V.

Most of the CVCs were partially-implanted, open-ended, Broviac-Hickman type of CVC (95 %). One thousand and twenty-four complications were recorded equal to 2.47 per 1000 CVC-days. The frequency of complications per CVC, the rate of episodes per 1000 CVC-days, and removal rate were malfunction/occlusion 42 %, 1.18/1000, and 2.3 %; mechanical (dislodgement/rupture/kinking) 18.3 %, 0.51/1000, and 77.4 %; bacteremia 14.8 %, 0.42/1000, and 18.6 %; exit-site/tunnel infection 11.5 %, 0.32/1000, and 9.7 %; thrombosis 0.86 %, 0.02/1000, and 30 %; pneumothorax 0.52 %, 0.01/1000, and 0. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors were for mechanical complications, a younger age <6.1 years at CVC insertion (HR 1.8, p = 0.0006); for bacteremia, a double lumen CVC (HR 3.1, p < 0.0001) and the surgical modality of CVC insertion (HR 1.5, p = 0.03); for exit-site/tunnel infection, a double lumen CVC (HR 2.1, p = 0.0003) and a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (HR 1.8, p = 0.01); for malfunction/occlusion, an age <6.1 years (HR 1.6, p = 0.0003), the diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (HR 1.9, p < 0.0001) and double lumen CVC (HR 1.33, p = 0.023). The cumulative incidence of premature CVC removal was 29.2 % and the risk factors associated with this event were the surgical modality of CVC insertion (HR 1.4, p = 0.0153) and an age at CVC positioning less than 6.1 years (HR 1.6, p = 0.0025). We conclude that a best-practice set of rules resulted in reduced CVC complications.",,"['Cesaro, Simone', 'Cavaliere, Mara', 'Pegoraro, Anna', 'Gamba, Piergiorgio', 'Zadra, Nicola', 'Tridello, Gloria']","['Cesaro S', 'Cavaliere M', 'Pegoraro A', 'Gamba P', 'Zadra N', 'Tridello G']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Piazzale L.A.

In contrast, due to the hostile immunosuppressive microenvironment of a solid tumor, CAR T-cell accessibility and survival continue to pose a considerable challenge, which leads to their limited therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we constructed two anti-MUC1 CAR-T cell lines. One set of CAR-T cells contained SM3 single chain variable fragment (scFv) sequence specifically targeting the MUC1 antigen and co-expressing interleukin (IL) 12 (named SM3-CAR). The other CAR-T cell line carried the SM3 scFv sequence modified to improve its binding to MUC1 antigen (named pSM3-CAR) but did not co-express IL-12. When those two types of CAR-T cells were injected intratumorally into two independent metastatic lesions of the same MUC1(+) seminal vesicle cancer patient as part of an interventional treatment strategy, the initial results indicated no side-effects of the MUC1 targeting CAR-T cell approach, and patient serum cytokines responses were positive. Further evaluation showed that pSM3-CAR effectively caused tumor necrosis, providing new options for improved CAR-T therapy in solid tumors.",,"['You, Fengtao', 'Jiang, Licui', 'Zhang, Bozhen', 'Lu, Qiang', 'Zhou, Qiao', 'Liao, Xiaoyang', 'Wu, Hong', 'Du, Kaiqi', 'Zhu, Youcai', 'Meng, Huimin', 'Gong, Zhishu', 'Zong, Yunhui', 'Huang, Lei', 'Lu, Man', 'Tang, Jirong', 'Li, Yafen', 'Zhai, Xiaochen', 'Wang, Xiangling', 'Ye, Sisi', 'Chen, Dan', 'Yuan, Lei', 'Qi, Lin', 'Yang, Lin']","['You F', 'Jiang L', 'Zhang B', 'Lu Q', 'Zhou Q', 'Liao X', 'Wu H', 'Du K', 'Zhu Y', 'Meng H', 'Gong Z', 'Zong Y', 'Huang L', 'Lu M', 'Tang J', 'Li Y', 'Zhai X', 'Wang X', 'Ye S', 'Chen D', 'Yuan L', 'Qi L', 'Yang L']","['The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', ""Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Chinese People's Armed Police Force of Zhejiang Corps Hospital, Jiaxing, 314000, China."", ""Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Chinese People's Armed Police Force of Zhejiang Corps Hospital, Jiaxing, 314000, China."", 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123, China.', ""The Medical Group of Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450004, China."", 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', ""College of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Suzhou, 215123, China."", ""College of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Suzhou, 215123, China."", 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China.', 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123, China. yanglin@suda.edu.cn.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, 215123, China. yanglin@suda.edu.cn.', 'Persongen Biomedicine (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, 215123, China. yanglin@suda.edu.cn.', ""College of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Suzhou, 215123, China. yanglin@suda.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160307,China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

New generation genome browsers such as the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) have largely overcome this limitation and permit customized analyses to be implemented using plugins. We illustrate the use of a plugin for IGB that exploits advanced visualization techniques to integrate the analysis of genomics data with network and structural approaches. RESULTS: We show how visualization technologies that combine both genomics and network biology can facilitate the selection of the key amino acid contacts from protein-protein and protein-drug interactions. Starting from the MDM2-P53 interaction, which is a high-value target for cancer therapy, and Nutlin, the parent small molecule of an MDM2 antagonist that is currently in clinical trials, we show that this method can be generalized to analyze how drugs and mutations can interfere with both protein-protein and drug-protein networks. We illustrate this point by two additional use-cases exploring the molecular basis of tamoxifen side effects and of drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: Combined network and structure biology approaches provide key insights into both the genetic and the edgetic roles of variants in diseases. 3D interactomes facilitate the identification of disease-relevant interactions that can then be specifically targeted by drugs. Recent advances in molecular interaction and structure visualization tools have greatly simplified the mapping of mutated residues to molecular interaction interfaces. Such approaches can now also be integrated with genome visualization tools to enable comparative analyses of interaction contacts.",,"['Ceol, Arnaud', 'Verhoef, Lisette G G C', 'Wade, Mark', 'Muller, Heiko']","['Ceol A', 'Verhoef LG', 'Wade M', 'Muller H']","['Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Via Adamello 16, Milan, I-20139, Italy. arnaud.ceol@iit.it.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Via Adamello 16, Milan, I-20139, Italy. lisette.verhoef@iit.it.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Via Adamello 16, Milan, I-20139, Italy. mark.wade@iit.it.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Via Adamello 16, Milan, I-20139, Italy. heiko.muller@iit.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160302,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['*Computer Graphics', 'Databases, Factual', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*drug effects', '*Genome, Human', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps/*drug effects', 'Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC4896239,,,2016/03/11 06:00,2016/10/19 06:00,['2016/03/11 06:00'],"['2016/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-016-0908-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-016-0908-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2016 Mar 2;17 Suppl 4:54. doi: 10.1186/s12859-016-0908-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CIK cultures were generated from seven normal donors and nine patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or multiple myeloma (MM). The inhibitory receptors B and T lymphocyte attenuator, CD200 receptor, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain-containing-3 (TIM-3) were present at variable percentages in most CIK cultures, while cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR2DL1/2/3) were expressed at low level in most cultures. Without blockade, myeloid leukaemia cells were susceptible to autologous and allogeneic CIK-mediated cytotoxicity. Blockade of KIR, LAG-3, PD-1 and TIM-3 but not CTLA-4 resulted in remarkable increase in killing against these targets, even in those with poor baseline cytotoxicity. ALL and MM targets were resistant to CIK-mediated cytotoxicity, and blockade of receptors did not increase cytotoxicity to a meaningful extent. Combination of inhibitors against two receptors did not further increase cytotoxicity. Interestingly, potentiation of CIK killing by blocking antibodies was not predicted by expression of receptors on CIK and their respective ligands on the targets. Compared to un-activated T and NK cells, blockade potentiated the cytotoxicity of CIK cells to a greater degree and at a lower E:T ratio, but without significant increase in cytotoxicity against normal white cell.

However, the long duration of this in vivo assay has hampered its use as a prognostic tool. Here, we show, using an ex vivo coculture system, that intermediate and poor risk AML patient samples at diagnosis have a 5 to 7 times higher frequency of leukemic long-term culture-initiating cells (L-LTC-IC) compared with the good risk group. We defined a fluorescence dilution factor (FDF) parameter that monitors sample proliferation over 1 week and established a strong correlation of this parameter with the L-LTC-IC frequency. A higher FDF was found for poor prognostic AMLs or for samples capable of engrafting NSG mice compared with good risk AMLs or nonengrafters. Importantly, FDF could classify normal karyotype intermediate risk patients into two groups with a significant difference in their overall survival, thus making this nongenetic and non-in vivo approach a new clinically relevant tool for better diagnosis of AML patients.

Therefore, there is urgent need to characterize dysregulated TK signaling axes in patients with ALL and identify actionable kinase targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we present the first study to quantitatively profile TK activity in xenografted patient biopsies of high-risk pediatric ALL. We integrated a quantitative phosphotyrosine profiling method with 'spike-in' stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and quantified 1394 class I phosphorylation sites in 16 ALL xenografts. Moreover, hierarchical clustering of phosphotyrosine sites could accurately classify these leukemias into either B or T-cell lineages with the high-risk early T-cell precursor (ETP) and Ph-like ALL clustering as a distinct group. Furthermore, we validated this approach by using specific kinase pathway inhibitors to perturb ABL1, FLT3, and JAK TK signaling in four xenografted patient samples. By quantitatively assessing the tyrosine phosphorylation status of activated kinases in xenograft models of ALL, we were able to identify and validate clinically relevant targets. Therefore, this study highlights the application and potential of phosphotyrosine profiling for identifying clinically relevant kinase targets in leukemia.","['Copyright (c)2016, American Association for Cancer Research.']","['Dolai, Sibasish', 'Sia, Keith C S', 'Robbins, Alissa K', 'Zhong, Ling', 'Heatley, Sue L', 'Vincent, Tiffaney L', 'Hochgrafe, Falko', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Kurmasheva, Raushan T', 'Revesz, Tamas', 'White, Deborah L', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Teachey, David T', 'Daly, Roger J', 'Raftery, Mark J', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Dolai S', 'Sia KC', 'Robbins AK', 'Zhong L', 'Heatley SL', 'Vincent TL', 'Hochgrafe F', 'Sutton R', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Revesz T', 'White DL', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA', 'Teachey DT', 'Daly RJ', 'Raftery MJ', 'Lock RB']","['Leukemia Biology, Childrens Cancer Institute.', ""Leukaemia Biology, Children's Cancer Institute."", 'Leukaemia Biology Program, Childrens Cancer Institute.', 'Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre, Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI).', ""Divison of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia."", 'Competence Center Functional Genomics, University of Greifswald.', ""Leukaemia Biology, Children's Cancer Institute."", 'Molecular Medicine, UTHSC San Antonio.', ""Women's & Children's Hospital, SA Pathology."", 'Cancer Theme, SAHMRI.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio."", 'Cancer Therapy Evaulation Program, National Cancer Institute.', ""Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University.', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility, University of New South Wales.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW rlock@ccia.org.au.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160309,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,,,PMC8670248,,,2016/03/11 06:00,2016/03/11 06:01,['2016/03/11 06:00'],"['2016/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/11 06:01 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-15-2786 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2786 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2016 May;76(9):2766-2777. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2786.

Here we provide findings of an international research project investigating the health and wellbeing impacts of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments. METHODS: Five European and two Chinese city authorities and partner academic organisations formed the project consortium. The methodology involved modelling the impact of adopted urban climate-change mitigation transport, buildings and energy policy scenarios, usually for the year 2020 and comparing them with business as usual (BAU) scenarios (where policies had not been adopted). Carbon dioxide emissions, health impacting exposures (air pollution, noise and physical activity), health (cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer and leukaemia) and wellbeing (including noise related wellbeing, overall wellbeing, economic wellbeing and inequalities) were modelled. The scenarios were developed from corresponding known levels in 2010 and pre-existing exposure response functions. Additionally there were literature reviews, three longitudinal observational studies and two cross sectional surveys. RESULTS: There are four key findings. Firstly introduction of electric cars may confer some small health benefits but it would be unwise for a city to invest in electric vehicles unless their power generation fuel mix generates fewer emissions than petrol and diesel. Second, adopting policies to reduce private car use may have benefits for carbon dioxide reduction and positive health impacts through reduced noise and increased physical activity. Third, the benefits of carbon dioxide reduction from increasing housing efficiency are likely to be minor and co-benefits for health and wellbeing are dependent on good air exchange. Fourthly, although heating dwellings by in-home biomass burning may reduce carbon dioxide emissions, consequences for health and wellbeing were negative with the technology in use in the cities studied. CONCLUSIONS: The climate-change reduction policies reduced CO2 emissions (the most common greenhouse gas) from cities but impact on global emissions of CO2 would be more limited due to some displacement of emissions. The health and wellbeing impacts varied and were often limited reflecting existing relatively high quality of life and environmental standards in most of the participating cities; the greatest potential for future health benefit occurs in less developed or developing countries.",,"['Sabel, Clive E', 'Hiscock, Rosemary', 'Asikainen, Arja', 'Bi, Jun', 'Depledge, Mike', 'van den Elshout, Sef', 'Friedrich, Rainer', 'Huang, Ganlin', 'Hurley, Fintan', 'Jantunen, Matti', 'Karakitsios, Spyros P', 'Keuken, Menno', 'Kingham, Simon', 'Kontoroupis, Periklis', 'Kuenzli, Nino', 'Liu, Miaomiao', 'Martuzzi, Marco', 'Morton, Katie', 'Mudu, Pierpaolo', 'Niittynen, Marjo', 'Perez, Laura', 'Sarigiannis, Denis', 'Stahl-Timmins, Will', 'Tobollik, Myriam', 'Tuomisto, Jouni', 'Willers, Saskia']","['Sabel CE', 'Hiscock R', 'Asikainen A', 'Bi J', 'Depledge M', 'van den Elshout S', 'Friedrich R', 'Huang G', 'Hurley F', 'Jantunen M', 'Karakitsios SP', 'Keuken M', 'Kingham S', 'Kontoroupis P', 'Kuenzli N', 'Liu M', 'Martuzzi M', 'Morton K', 'Mudu P', 'Niittynen M', 'Perez L', 'Sarigiannis D', 'Stahl-Timmins W', 'Tobollik M', 'Tuomisto J', 'Willers S']","['School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1SS, UK. c.sabel@bristol.ac.uk.', 'School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1SS, UK.', 'National Institute for Health and Welfare, FI-70701, Kuopio, Finland.', 'School of the Environment, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.', 'European Centre for Environment and Human health, University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.', 'Air Quality Department, DCMR Environmental Protection Agency Rijnmond, Schiedam, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Energy Economics and the Rational Use of Energy (IER), University of Stuttgart, 70565, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Institute of Energy Economics and the Rational Use of Energy (IER), University of Stuttgart, 70565, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'IOM (Institute of Occupational Medicine), Riccarton, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.', 'National Institute for Health and Welfare, 70210, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Chemical Process and Energy Resources Institute, 57001, Thermi, Greece.', 'Netherlands Organization for Applied Research (TNO), 3584 CB, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Geography, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Chemical Process and Energy Resources Institute, 57001, Thermi, Greece.', 'Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'School of the Environment, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.', 'European Centre for Environment and Health, WHO Regional Office for Europe, 53113, Bonn, Germany.', 'School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1SS, UK.', 'European Centre for Environment and Health, WHO Regional Office for Europe, 53113, Bonn, Germany.', 'National Institute for Health and Welfare, FI-70701, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Environmental Engineering Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, 54124, Greece.', 'The BMJ, BMA House, London, WC1H 9JP, UK.', 'School of Public Health, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'National Institute for Health and Welfare, FI-70701, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Air Quality Department, DCMR Environmental Protection Agency Rijnmond, Schiedam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160308,England,Environ Health,Environmental health : a global access science source,101147645,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Gases)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/analysis', 'Air Pollution/*prevention & control', 'China', 'Cities', 'Climate Change', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Europe', 'European Union', 'Gases/analysis', 'Government Regulation', 'Greenhouse Effect/*prevention & control', 'Health Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Public Health/*legislation & jurisprudence']",PMC4895602,,,2016/03/11 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/11 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12940-016-0097-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12940-016-0097-0 [pii]']",epublish,Environ Health. 2016 Mar 8;15 Suppl 1:25. doi: 10.1186/s12940-016-0097-0.,,['001/World Health Organization/International'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 25-year-old Japanese man underwent cord blood transplantation from a male human leukocyte antigen 4/6-matched donor due to acute myeloid leukemia with trisomy 8. Bone marrow examination on day 30 showed chimerism with at least 90% donor cells and complete hematological response. Chronic symptoms of graft-versus-host disease appeared only on the skin and were successfully treated with cyclosporine alone. Three years later, however, the patient experienced repeated cold-like symptoms and was hospitalized with liver dysfunction. A high fever developed and was followed by significant edema of the right side of the face. The EBV DNA copy number in whole peripheral blood was 2x10(4)/mL. Liver biopsy showed invasion of EBV-infected CD8-positive T cells. Southern blotting analysis of the whole peripheral blood showed that the T-cell receptor Cbeta1 rearrangement was positive. On the basis of these results, EBV-positive T-cell LPD was diagnosed and treated with prednisolone, cyclosporine, and etoposide, followed by cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone.

GSTs detoxify potentially mutagenic and toxic DNA-reactive electrophiles, including metabolites of several chemotherapeutic agents, some of which are suspected human carcinogens. Polymorphisms within the phase II metabolizer enzymes GST T1, GST M1, and GST P1 affect the body's ability to detoxify a range of potential leukemogens encountered in the environment. AIM OF WORK: To address how differences in the human GST isoenzyme expression patterns influence cancer susceptibility, prognosis, and treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as 50 age and sex matched apparently healthy volunteers were genotyped for GSTP 1, GSTM 1, and GSTT 1 gene polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. RESULTS: For GSTP1 313 A --> G (GSTP1 Ile105Val) polymorphism, It was found that the wild genotype (AA) was significantly higher among control subjects (P value = 0.0277), while the frequency of heteromutant genotype (AG) and mutant G allele (AG + GG) was significantly higher among patients (P value = 0.0402, P value = 0.0277, respectively). For GSTM1 and GSTT1gene, we found statistically significantly higher frequency among patients regarding homozygous gene deletion (P value = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that GSTM1 null or GSTT1 null genotypes may be considered independent risk factors for AML with no impact on prognosis and GSTP1 * 105 genotype is a prognostic factor, adding independent information to the routine laboratory parameters and cytogenetic and molecular alterations of the tumor cells.",,"['Nasr, Aml S', 'Sami, Rania M', 'Ibrahim, Noha Y', 'Darwish, Dalia O']","['Nasr AS', 'Sami RM', 'Ibrahim NY', 'Darwish DO']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Kasr El Eini School of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",,,,2016/03/11 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/11 06:00'],"['2016/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2015_52_4_490_178408 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.178408 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2015 Oct-Dec;52(4):490-5. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.178408.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database was used to identify eligible patients hospitalized between April 2009 and July 2014. Eligible patients were continuously enrolled 6 months before (pre-index) their first claim with an eligible relapsed ALL diagnosis (index date) and followed up for a maximum of 18 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 583 hospitalizations involving 205 adults with Ph(-) relapsed B-precursor ALL were identified. Mean (SD) percentage of follow-up time spent in the hospital was 56.2% (40.0%). Mean (SD) length of stay per hospitalization was 13.1 (15.7) days; mean (SD) reimbursement per hospitalization stay was $89,663 ($195,725).

The aim of this study was to estimate the cancer incidence and mortality in Wuwei, Gansu province, Northwestern China from 2003 to 2012. The goal is to better understand cancer distribution and long-term development of cancer prevention and treatment in Wuwei. METHODS: Data were collected from the Wuwei Cancer Registry between 2003 and 2012. In this registry, data from 46 cancer report centers were included in this analysis. Incidence/mortality rates, age-specific incidence/mortality rates, age-standardized incidence/mortality rates, and cumulative incidence/mortality rates were calculated. Totally, 9,836,740 person-years (5,110,342 for males and 4,726,398 for females) had been monitored over this time period. The gender ratio of male/female was 1.08:1. The number of new cancer cases and related deaths was 24,705 and 17,287 from 2003 to 2012, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of morphological verification was 74.43%. The incidence of cases identified through death certification only was 1.21%, and the mortality to incidence ratio was 0.70. The average crude incidence was 251.15/100,000 persons (310.61 and 186.87 for males and females per 100,000 persons, respectively). The age-standardized rates by Chinese standard population (ASR-China) and by world standard population (ASR-world) were 207.76 and 245.42 per 100,000 persons, respectively. The crude cancer mortality was 175.74/100,000 persons (228.34 and 118.86 for males and females per 100,000 persons). ASR for China and the world was 149.57 and 175.13/100,000 persons, respectively. The most common cancers and leading causes of cancer-related deaths in Wuwei were as follows: cancers of stomach, esophagus, liver, lung, colorectum, breast, cervix, lymphoma, blood (leukemia), brain, and central nervous system. In Wuwei, during 2003 and 2012, cancer incidence and mortality rates increased by 1.32% and 1.31%/year, respectively. During this time, colorectum cancer incidence and mortality rates increased by 2.69% and 7.54%/year, respectively, in Wuwei. The incidence and mortality of other gastric, esophageal, liver, and lung cancers also all increased.

RESULTS: One hundred seventy-one patients (92 males, 79 females), median age of 6 years (range, 0.2-21), who underwent 181 procedures (110 open, 59 endoscopic, and 12 laparoscopic) were identified. Diagnosis included central nervous system tumor (n = 101), solid tumor (n = 45), and leukemia/lymphoma (n = 25). A GT tube was used in 139 procedures and a GT button in 42. Median ANC level at procedure was 3,300/mm(3) (range, 0-38,988). Median duration of GT usage was 8 months (range, 0.2-142). One hundred seventy-seven complications occurred in 106 patients (61.9%) and were categorized as perioperative (<1 month after surgery, 20.3%) and late (>1 month after surgery, 79.7%). Major complications included 42 (23.7%) GT site infections and four (2.2%) intrabdominal complications. The most common minor complication was granulation tissue (28.8%). Younger age at procedure was associated with complications (P = 0.048) and an open technique was associated with GT site infection (P = 0.003). No statistical significance was observed between complications and gender, diagnosis, GT device, duration of GT usage, and ANC at procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients were more likely to have complications, and GT site infections were more common after open GT procedures.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Fernandez-Pineda, Israel', 'Sandoval, John A', 'Jones, Reagan M', 'Boateng, Nana', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Rao, Bhaskar N', 'Davidoff, Andrew M', 'Shochat, Stephen J']","['Fernandez-Pineda I', 'Sandoval JA', 'Jones RM', 'Boateng N', 'Wu J', 'Rao BN', 'Davidoff AM', 'Shochat SJ']","[""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160309,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gastrostomy/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*surgery', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",PMC5704922,['NOTNLM'],"['*complications', '*gastrostomy', '*pediatric oncology']",2016/03/10 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25968 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jul;63(7):1250-3. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25968.

We observed that Metformin alone exhibited a dose-dependent anti-leukemic activity in both B leukemic cell lines and primary B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients' cells and its anti-leukemic activity was enhanced when used in combination with DCA. In order to overcome the problems of poor bioavailability and cellular uptake, which limit DCA efficacy, we have designed and synthetized cocrystals consisting of Metformin and DCA (Met-DCA) at different stoichiometric ratios. Of note, the MetH(2)(++)*2DCA(-) cocrystal exhibited enhanced in vitro anti-leukemic activity, with respect to the treatment with the mix consisting of Metformin plus DCA. In particular, the treatment with the cocrystal MetH(2)(++)*2DCA(-) induced a synergistic apoptotic cell death coupled to a marked down-modulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. Taken together, our data emphasize that innovative compounds based on Metformin-DCA combination merit to be further evaluated as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of B-CLL.",,"['Voltan, Rebecca', 'Rimondi, Erika', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Gilli, Paola', 'Bertolasi, Valerio', 'Casciano, Fabio', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Secchiero, Paola']","['Voltan R', 'Rimondi E', 'Melloni E', 'Gilli P', 'Bertolasi V', 'Casciano F', 'Rigolin GM', 'Zauli G', 'Secchiero P']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery, Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery, Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery, Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara-Arcispedale S.

We previously discovered a point mutation and deletion in the 3' flanking region of mir-16-1 of NZB and a similar mutation has been found in a small number of CLL patients. However, it was unknown whether the mutation is the cause for the reduced miR-15a/16-1 expression and CLL development. Using PCR and in vitro microRNA processing assays, we found that the NZB sequence alterations in the mir-15a/16-1 loci result in deficient processing of the precursor forms of miR-15a/16-1, in particular, we observe impaired conversion of pri-miR-15a/16-1 to pre-miR-15a/16-1. The in vitro data was further supported by derivation of congenic strains with replaced mir-15a/16-1 loci at one or both alleles: NZB congenic mice (NmiR+/-) and DBA congenic mice (DmiR-/-). The level of miR-15a/16-1 reflected the configuration of the mir-15a/16-1 loci with DBA congenic mice (DmiR-/-) showing reduced miR-15a levels compared to homozygous wild-type allele, while the NZB congenic mice (NmiR+/-) showed an increase in miR-15a levels relative to homozygous mutant allele. Similar to Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis (MBL), the precursor stage of the human disease, an overall expansion of the B-1 population was observed in DBA congenic mice (DmiR-/-) relative to wild-type (DmiR+/+). These studies support our hypothesis that the mutations in the mir-15a/16-1 loci are responsible for decreased expression of this regulatory microRNA leading to B-1 expansion and CLL development.",,"['Kasar, Siddha', 'Underbayev, Chingiz', 'Hassan, Moinuddin', 'Ilev, Ilko', 'Degheidy, Heba', 'Bauer, Steven', 'Marti, Gerald', 'Lutz, Carol', 'Raveche, Elizabeth', 'Batish, Mona']","['Kasar S', 'Underbayev C', 'Hassan M', 'Ilev I', 'Degheidy H', 'Bauer S', 'Marti G', 'Lutz C', 'Raveche E', 'Batish M']","['New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey, 07103, United States of America.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey, 07103, United States of America.', 'OSEL/CDRH/FDA White Oak, Maryland, United States of America.', 'OSEL/CDRH/FDA White Oak, Maryland, United States of America.', 'CBER/FDA White Oak, Maryland, United States of America.', 'CBER/FDA White Oak, Maryland, United States of America.', 'OSEL/CDRH/FDA White Oak, Maryland, United States of America.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey, 07103, United States of America.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey, 07103, United States of America.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey, 07103, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160309,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn15 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mirn16 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.- (Dleu2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genetic Loci', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proteins/genetics', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Side-Population Cells/metabolism', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Transferases']",PMC4784815,,,2016/03/10 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0149331 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-36624 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Mar 9;11(3):e0149331. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0149331. eCollection 2016.,,"['DP5 OD012160/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP5OD012160-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA12926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rearrangement of the MLL1 gene is associated with onset and progression of acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias, and targeting the WDR5-MLL1 interaction may result in new cancer therapeutics. Our previous work showed that binding of small molecule ligands to WDR5 can modulate its interaction with MLL1, suppressing MLL1 methyltransferase activity. Initial structure-activity relationship studies identified N-(2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-5-substituted-phenyl) benzamides as potent and selective antagonists of this protein-protein interaction. Guided by crystal structure data and supported by in silico library design, we optimized the scaffold by varying the C-1 benzamide and C-5 substituents. This allowed us to develop the first highly potent (Kdisp < 100 nM) small molecule antagonists of the WDR5-MLL1 interaction and demonstrate that

In the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 30504 randomized phase II trial, patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), without progression after four to six cycles of standard chemotherapy with cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide, were randomized to sunitinib or placebo, until disease progression. Primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), and the results were formally positive [hazard ratio (HR) 0.62; one-sided P=0.02]. However, the prognosis of patients with extensive-stage SCLC is particularly bad, and even a relevant relative benefit (i.e., an encouraging HR) will likely correspond to a debatable absolute benefit: the difference in median PFS between patients treated with sunitinib and patients assigned to control arm was slightly higher than 1.5 months. Is this difference in median PFS big enough to predict a clinically relevant benefit in overall survival? Unfortunately, we do not know. From a ""clinical"" point of view, is this small absolute improvement in PFS relevant enough to further invest in the strategy? Probably not, also considering the absence of known predictive factors. If the results of the phase II trial had been really promising, the subsequent phase III study should have been promptly conducted, but this was not the case.

High circulating levels of methotrexate can cause severe myelosuppression. The present study aimed to examine the differences in plasma MTX concentrations measured by two immunoassay systems currently available in the Japanese market, a TDX/FLX analyzer and a TBA-25FR analyzer. METHODS: A total of 69 plasma samples from 16 patients were assayed by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay technique using a TDx/FLx analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.) and a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique using a TBA-25FR analyzer (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). RESULTS: Assay results were very consistent between the two systems, with good correlation 24 h after the start of treatment (TBA-25FR = 1.06TDX/FLX, -1.31, r = 0.99), 48 h after the start of treatment (TBA-25FR = 1.00TDX/FLX, +0.027, r > 0.99), and 72 h after the start of treatment (TBA-25FR = 1.09TDX/FLX, +0.011, r > 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The calibration curve spanned one order of magnitude with a linear working range from the lowest to the highest standard. The standard deviations show the excellent reproducibility of repeated measurements at each standard level for both immunoassay systems. However, when using the TBA-25FR, it is necessary to perform measurements in the low-concentration range with care.",,"['Kaneko, Tetsuya', 'Fujioka, Takashi', 'Suzuki, Yosuke', 'Sato, Yuhki', 'Itoh, Hiroki']","['Kaneko T', 'Fujioka T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Sato Y', 'Itoh H']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Oita University Hospital, Hasama-machi, Oita 879-5593 Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Oita University Hospital, Hasama-machi, Oita 879-5593 Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Oita University Hospital, Hasama-machi, Oita 879-5593 Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Oita University Hospital, Hasama-machi, Oita 879-5593 Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Oita University Hospital, Hasama-machi, Oita 879-5593 Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160308,England,J Pharm Health Care Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical health care and sciences,101672177,,,,PMC4782285,['NOTNLM'],"['Automatic immunoassay systems', 'High-dose Methotrexate', 'Methotrexate', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring']",2016/03/10 06:00,2016/03/10 06:01,['2016/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40780-016-0042-y [doi]', '42 [pii]']",epublish,J Pharm Health Care Sci. 2016 Mar 8;2:7. doi: 10.1186/s40780-016-0042-y. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to examine rates of and factors predictive of oncologists' compliance with national guidelines for discussing potential treatment-related infertility with newly diagnosed young adults with cancer seen at an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center. METHODS: We reviewed data from the electronic medical record for new clinic encounters between medical oncologists and young adults with cancer (ages 18-39 years) from 2010 to 2012. Data from oncologist discussions of fertility preservation were abstracted, as were patient (age, sex, race, ethnicity, cancer type) and oncologist (gender, graduation year from fellowship) characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 1,018 cases were reviewed, with 454 patients (mean, 31.5 years; 67.8% women) meeting inclusion criteria. Overall, 83% of patients were informed about potential treatment-related infertility, with patients with breast cancer (85% informed), Hodgkin lymphoma (95% informed), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (94% informed), leukemia (88% informed), or testicular cancer (100% informed) more likely to be informed than those with other cancer types (60%-74% informed). There was a significant effect for patient sex (odds ratio, 3.57; CI, 1.33, 9.60; P=.012), with women being more likely to be informed than men. CONCLUSIONS: Reported compliance with fertility preservation guidelines was greater than published rates. Higher compliance rates in female patients and in patients with cancers more common among young adults may reflect greater awareness of fertility-related concerns among these patients and their providers.",['Copyright (c) 2016 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],"['Salsman, John M', 'Yanez, Betina', 'Smith, Kristin N', 'Beaumont, Jennifer L', 'Snyder, Mallory A', 'Barnes, Khouri', 'Clayman, Marla L']","['Salsman JM', 'Yanez B', 'Smith KN', 'Beaumont JL', 'Snyder MA', 'Barnes K', 'Clayman ML']","['Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine', 'The Robert H.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used piggyBac transposon-mediated mutagenesis, combined with next-generation sequencing, to identify genes that confer resistance to fludarabine in a human CLL cell line. RESULTS: In total, this screen identified 782 genes with transposon integrations in fludarabine-resistant pools of cells. One of the identified genes is a known resistance mediator DCK (deoxycytidine kinase), which encodes an enzyme that is essential for the phosphorylation of the prodrug to the active metabolite. BMP2K, a gene not previously linked to CLL, was also identified as a modulator of response to fludarabine. In addition, 10 of 782 transposon-targeted genes had previously been implicated in treatment resistance based on somatic mutations seen in patients refractory to fludarabine-based therapy. Functional characterization of these genes supported a significant role for ARID5B and BRAF in fludarabine sensitivity. Finally, pathway analysis of transposon-targeted genes and RNA-seq profiling of fludarabine-resistant cells suggested deregulated MAPK signaling as involved in mediating drug resistance in CLL. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first forward genetic screen for chemotherapy resistance in CLL. The screen pinpointed novel genes and pathways involved in fludarabine resistance along with previously known resistance mechanisms. Transposon screens can therefore aid interpretation of cancer genome sequencing data in the identification of genes modifying sensitivity to chemotherapy. Clin Cancer Res; 22(24); 6217-27.

Gamma-RV vectors that contained full viral long-terminal repeats were most prone to causing double negative 2 (DN2) arrest and led to repeated cases of Lmo2 pathway activation, while lentiviral vectors containing these same elements were significantly less prone to activate proto-oncogenes or cause DN2 arrest. This work provides a new preclinical assay that is especially relevant for assessing safety in SCID disorders and provides a new tool for designing safer RV vectors.",,"['Zhou, Sheng', 'Fatima, Soghra', 'Ma, Zhijun', 'Wang, Yong-Dong', 'Lu, Taihe', 'Janke, Laura J', 'Du, Yang', 'Sorrentino, Brian P']","['Zhou S', 'Fatima S', 'Ma Z', 'Wang YD', 'Lu T', 'Janke LJ', 'Du Y', 'Sorrentino BP']","['Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Computational Biology, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

It may arise from myelodysplastic syndromes, malignancy or de novo. Presentation in the larynx is rare and some may present with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) whereby the later may be asymptomatic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old South East Asian lady presented with a six months history of hoarseness, shortness of breath, reduced exercise tolerance, weight loss and laryngeal irritation. Symptoms progressed to coughing with liquids two months prior. On examination, she had a resting biphasic stridor and laryngoscopy revealed right immobile vocal cord with a firm right ventricle mass extending into the right paraglottic space. She was pale and haematology investigations revealed microcytic hypochromic anaemia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the neck and thorax showed thickening of the right false cord, true cord and aryepiglottic fold. A biopsy taken during endolaryngeal microsurgery (ELMS) confirmed myeloid sarcoma of the right ventricle and para glottic mass. Further investigation revealed a background of AML and she then underwent chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: MS is a rarity with only nine reported cases between the years of 1954 until 2015. Immunohistochemistry and immunophenotyping are definite for diagnosis confirmation as MS cells often exhibit myeloperoxidase (MPO), lymphocyte common antigen (LCA) and CD117 markers. MS is treated with are chemotherapy (either systemic or intrathecal), radiotherapy, surgical excision or in combination. Systemic chemotherapy has better efficacy and prognosis as compared to localised treatment of radiotherapy or surgical excision. However, there has yet to be a definitive chemotherapy protocol. Prognosis is poor with a 5-year survival rate of 48%. CONCLUSION: Although laryngeal MS is a rare phenomenon, early recognition is key and patients should always be investigated for an underlying myeloproliferative or dysplastic disease.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

METHOD: Totally 141 children (<14 years of age) with newly diagnosed ETV6/RUNX1 positive ALL in Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, were included from January 2006 to November 2012. The CNVs were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The survival rate between the patients with CNVs were explored. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. RESULT: Among the 141 cases, 55.3% (n=78) were boys and 44.7% (n=63) were girls and the median age was 4 (1-13) years. The estimated 5-year DFS rate for the patients was (84+/-4)%. The estimated 5-year OS rate for the patients was (85+/-4)%. Ninety-five patients were tested MLPA. CNVs were detected in 73 cases (76.8%). CNVs of genes EBF1(15.8%), CDKN2A/2B(18.9%), PAX5(21.1%), ETV6(54.8%), BTG1(10.5%) were detected in more than 10% of the patients.

Bortezomib also known as Velcade((R)), a proteasome inhibitor that has been approved by the food and drug administration for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, and many clinical trials are ongoing to examine to the efficacy of bortezomib for the treatment of other malignancies. Bortezomib has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth of many cancer cells. In current study, we determine whether bortezomib induces cell death/apoptosis in CML. METHODS: Cell viability was measured using MTT assays. Apoptosis was measured by annexin V/PI dual staining and DNA fragmentation assays. Immunoblotting was performed to examine the expression of proteins. Colony assays were performed using methylcellulose. RESULTS: Treatment of CML cells with bortezomib results in downregulation of S-phase kinase protein 2 (SKP2) and concomitant stabilization of the expression of p27Kip1. Furthermore, knockdown of SKP2 with small interference RNA specific for SKP2 caused accumulation of p27Kip1. CML cells exposed to bortezomib leads to conformational changes in Bax protein, resulting in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and leakage of cytochrome c to the cytosol. In the cytosol, cytochrome c causes sequential activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP cleavage and apoptosis. Pretreatment of CML cells with a universal inhibitor of caspases, z-VAD-fmk, prevents bortezomib-mediated apoptosis. Our data also demonstrated that bortezomib treatment of CML downregulates the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Finally, inhibition of proteasome pathways by bortezomib suppresses colony formation ability of CML cells. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these findings suggest that bortezomib suppresses the cell proliferation via induction of apoptosis in CML cells by downregulation of SKP2 with concomitant accumulation of p27Kip1, suggesting that proteasomal pathway may form novel therapeutic targets for better management of CML.",,"['Iskandarani, Ahmad', 'Bhat, Ajaz A', 'Siveen, Kodappully S', 'Prabhu, Kirti S', 'Kuttikrishnan, Shilpa', 'Khan, Muzammil A', 'Krishnankutty, Roopesh', 'Kulinski, Michal', 'Nasr, Rihab R', 'Mohammad, Ramzi M', 'Uddin, Shahab']","['Iskandarani A', 'Bhat AA', 'Siveen KS', 'Prabhu KS', 'Kuttikrishnan S', 'Khan MA', 'Krishnankutty R', 'Kulinski M', 'Nasr RR', 'Mohammad RM', 'Uddin S']","['Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, State of Qatar.

To further understand the genetic susceptibility for CLL and identify common loci associated with risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of four genome-wide association studies (GWAS) composed of 3,100 cases and 7,667 controls with follow-up replication in 1,958 cases and 5,530 controls. Here we report three new loci at 3p24.1 (rs9880772, EOMES, P=2.55 x 10(-11)), 6p25.2 (rs73718779, SERPINB6, P=1.97 x 10(-8)) and 3q28 (rs9815073, LPP, P=3.62 x 10(-8)), as well as a new independent SNP at the known 2q13 locus (rs9308731, BCL2L11, P=1.00 x 10(-11)) in the combined analysis. We find suggestive evidence (P<5 x 10(-7)) for two additional new loci at 4q24 (rs10028805, BANK1, P=7.19 x 10(-8)) and 3p22.2 (rs1274963, CSRNP1, P=2.12 x 10(-7)). Pathway analyses of new and known CLL loci consistently show a strong role for apoptosis, providing further evidence for the importance of this biological pathway in CLL susceptibility.",,"['Berndt,

A key goal is the prediction of patients with high risk of disease progression, which could benefit from an earlier or more intense treatment. In this work we introduce a simple methodology based on machine learning methods to help physicians in their decision making in different problems related to CLL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical data belongs to a retrospective study of a cohort of 265 Caucasians who were diagnosed with CLL between 1997 and 2007 in Hospital Cabuenes (Asturias, Spain). Different machine learning methods were applied to find the shortest list of most discriminatory prognostic variables to predict the need of Chemotherapy Treatment and the development of an Autoimmune Disease. RESULTS: Autoimmune disease occurrence was predicted with very high accuracy (>90%). Autoimmune disease development is currently an unpredictable severe complication of CLL. Chemotherapy Treatment has been predicted with a lower accuracy (80%). Risk analysis showed that the number of false positives and false negatives are well balanced. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of prognostic variables associated with the characteristics of platelets, reticulocytes and natural killers, which are the main targets of the autoimmune haemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia for autoimmune disease development, and also, the relevance of some clinical variables related with the immune characteristics of CLL patients that are not taking into account by current prognostic markers for predicting the need of chemotherapy.

Drugs targeting the Pim protein kinases are being tested in phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. The goal of these studies was to identify Pim substrate(s) that could help define the pathway regulated by these enzymes and potentially serve as a biomarker of Pim activity. To identify novel substrates, bioinformatics analysis was carried out to identify proteins containing a consensus Pim phosphorylation site. This analysis identified the insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) as potential Pim substrates. Experiments were carried out in tissue culture, animals, and human samples from phase I trials to validate this observation and define the biologic readout of this phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates in both malignant and normal cells using either genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the Pim kinases or overexpression of this family of enzymes that human IRS1S1101 and IRS2S1149 are Pim substrates. In xenograft tumor experiments and in a human phase I clinical trial, a pan-Pim inhibitor administered in vivo to animals or humans decreased IRS1S1101 phosphorylation in tumor tissues. This phosphorylation was shown to have effects on the half-life of the IRS family of proteins, suggesting a role in insulin or IGF signaling. These results demonstrate that IRS1S1101 is a novel substrate for the Pim kinases and provide a novel marker for evaluation of Pim inhibitor therapy.",,"['Song, Jin H', 'Padi, Sathish K R', 'Luevano, Libia A', 'Minden, Mark D', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Hardiman, Gary', 'Ball, Lauren E', 'Warfel, Noel A', 'Kraft, Andrew S']","['Song JH', 'Padi SK', 'Luevano LA', 'Minden MD', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Hardiman G', 'Ball LE', 'Warfel NA', 'Kraft AS']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Public Health Sciences and The Center for Genomics Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (AZD1208)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (IRS1 protein, human)', '0 (IRS2 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Humans', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thiazolidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4991444,['NOTNLM'],"['IGF1', 'IRS1', 'Pim kinase', 'Pim kinase inhibitor', 'insulin']",2016/03/10 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['7918 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7918 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Apr 12;7(15):20152-65. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7918.,,"['P30 CA023074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE020925/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD010731/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the previously reported effect on AML apoptosis, we have demonstrated that ARC enhances migration and adhesion of leukemia cells to MSCs both in vitro and in a novel human extramedullary bone/bone marrow mouse model. Mechanistic studies revealed that ARC induces IL1beta expression in AML cells and increases CCL2, CCL4, and CXCL12 expression in MSCs, both through ARC-mediated activation of NFkappaB. Expression of these chemokines in MSCs increased by AML cells in an ARC/IL1beta-dependent manner; likewise, IL1beta expression was elevated when leukemia cells were co-cultured with MSCs. Further, cells from AML patients expressed the receptors for and migrated toward CCL2, CCL4, and CXCL12. Inhibition of IL1beta suppressed AML cell migration and sensitized the cells co-cultured with MSCs to chemotherapy. Our results suggest the existence of a complex ARC-regulated circuit that maintains intimate connection of AML with the tumor microenvironment through NFkappaB/IL1beta-regulated chemokine receptor/ligand axes and reciprocal crosstalk resulting in cytoprotection.

Herein we report the entire country data on incidence and survival of CML, as well as penetrance of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in Lithuania. METHODS: We analyzed all patients (N = 601) from the national haematological disease monitoring system who were diagnosed with CML between 2000 and 2013. Crude (CR) and age-standardized (weighted) (ASW(R)) incidence and mortality rates, as well as 1-, 5-, and 10-year relative survival rates (RSR) were calculated. Information on TKI penetration is also reported. RESULTS: Throughout the entire 2000-2013 period the median age at diagnosis of CML patients was 62 years. The respective incidence and mortality CRs were 1.28 and 0.78, both characterized by decreasing trends over the observation period. A 5-year RSR increased from 0.33 [95 % CI, 0.27-0.40] in 2000-2004 to 0.55 [95 % CI, 0.47-0.63] in 2005-2009. However, the respective 5-year RSRs for patients aged 65-74 and >/=75 were only 0.33 [95 % CI, 0.24-0.42] and 0.18 [95 % CI 0.07-0.23] during the entire study period. TKI penetrance for CML patients grew from 1.5 % in 2000-2004 to 30.6 % in 2005-2009 and 69.1 % in 2010-2013. TKI penetrance was low in the older age groups (60 % for the 65-74 and 19 % for the >/=75 patient group, in 2010-2013). CONCLUSION: Relative CML survival in Lithuania steadily improved and paralleled the increase in TKI treatment availability. Patients above 64 years rarely received TKIs and their relative survival remained low throughout the observation period. The latency of TKI availability may have influenced the survival trends.",,"['Beinortas, Tumas', 'Tavoriene, Ilma', 'Zvirblis, Tadas', 'Gerbutavicius, Rolandas', 'Jurgutis, Mindaugas', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas']","['Beinortas T', 'Tavoriene I', 'Zvirblis T', 'Gerbutavicius R', 'Jurgutis M', 'Griskevicius L']","['Clinical Medical School, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. tumasbeinortas@gmail.com.', 'Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Clinics of Internal, Family Medicine and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, M.

There is a subset of patients, however, who achieve reduction of leukemic blast cells with a subnormal platelet count, designated as CR with incomplete platelet recovery (platelet count, </=100,000/mcL; normal, 150,000-450,000/mcL), which is associated with inferior outcomes when compared with CR. Furthermore, there is another subset of patients with CR but superior platelet counts (>/=400,000/mcL) whose prognostic significance is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To establish whether CR with superior platelet counts is associated with better outcomes and can be used as a separate entity for prognostication. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 104 cases of AML was conducted. The highest platelet count during days 25-35 from initiation of induction chemotherapy (designated as day 30 platelet count) was documented. A multivariate analysis for other factors such as age, sex, risk categories, day 14+ plasma cell count (average plasma cell percentage at days 14-21), infections, allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and remission status was done. RESULTS: Day 30 platelet count was found to be an independent predictor of survival in AML. On the multivariate analysis, the subgroup with superior platelet counts (>/=400,000/mcL) was found to be associated with better outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Results need to be validated in a larger cohort. CONCLUSIONS: CR with superior platelet recovery (>/=400,000/mcL) is a unique subcategory in itself and has prognostic significance.

Relapse most often results from a small number of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) within the bone marrow, which are able to self-renew, and therefore reestablish the full tumor. The marrow microenvironment contributes considerably in supporting the protection and development of leukemic cells. LSCs share specific niches with normal hematopoietic stem cells with the niche itself being composed of a variety of cell types, including mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, bone cells, immune cells, neuronal cells, and vascular cells. A hallmark of the hematopoietic niche is low oxygen partial pressure, indeed this hypoxia is necessary for the long-term maintenance of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Hypoxia is a strong signal, principally maintained by members of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family. In solid tumors, it has been well established that hypoxia triggers intrinsic metabolic changes and microenvironmental modifications, such as the stimulation of angiogenesis, through activation of HIFs. As leukemia is not considered a ""solid"" tumor, the role of oxygen in the disease was presumed to be inconsequential and remained long overlooked. This view has now been revised since hypoxia has been shown to influence leukemic cell proliferation, differentiation, and resistance to chemotherapy. However, the role of HIF proteins remains controversial with HIFs being considered as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, depending on the study and model. The purpose of this review is to highlight our knowledge of hypoxia and HIFs in leukemic development and therapeutic resistance and to discuss the recent hypoxia-based strategies proposed to eradicate leukemias.",,"['Deynoux, Margaux', 'Sunter, Nicola', 'Herault, Olivier', 'Mazurier, Frederic']","['Deynoux M', 'Sunter N', 'Herault O', 'Mazurier F']","['Genetique, Immunotherapie, Chimie et Cancer (GICC) UMR 7292, CNRS, UFR de Medecine, Universite Francois-Rabelais de Tours , Tours , France.', 'Genetique, Immunotherapie, Chimie et Cancer (GICC) UMR 7292, CNRS, UFR de Medecine, Universite Francois-Rabelais de Tours , Tours , France.', ""Genetique, Immunotherapie, Chimie et Cancer (GICC) UMR 7292, CNRS, UFR de Medecine, Universite Francois-Rabelais de Tours, Tours, France; Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire de Tours, Tours, France."", 'Genetique, Immunotherapie, Chimie et Cancer (GICC) UMR 7292, CNRS, UFR de Medecine, Universite Francois-Rabelais de Tours , Tours , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160226,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC4767894,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia-inducible factors', 'leukemia', 'microenvironment']",2016/03/10 06:00,2016/03/10 06:01,['2016/03/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2016.00041 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2016 Feb 26;6:41. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2016.00041. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No single, internationally validated, prediction model of the risk of adverse outcomes exists for children and young people. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was undertaken to devise one. METHODS: The 'Predicting Infectious Complications in Children with Cancer' (PICNICC) collaboration was formed by parent representatives, international clinical and methodological experts. Univariable and multivariable analyses, using random effects logistic regression, were undertaken to derive and internally validate a risk-prediction model for outcomes of episodes of FN based on clinical and laboratory data at presentation. RESULTS: Data came from 22 different study groups from 15 countries, of 5127 episodes of FN in 3504 patients. There were 1070 episodes in 616 patients from seven studies available for multivariable analysis. Univariable analyses showed associations with microbiologically defined infection (MDI) in many items, including higher temperature, lower white cell counts and acute myeloid leukaemia, but not age. Patients with osteosarcoma/Ewings sarcoma and those with more severe mucositis were associated with a decreased risk of MDI. The predictive model included: malignancy type, temperature, clinically 'severely unwell', haemoglobin, white cell count and absolute monocyte count. It showed moderate discrimination (AUROC 0.723, 95% confidence interval 0.711-0.759) and good calibration (calibration slope 0.95). The model was robust to bootstrap and cross-validation sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This new prediction model for risk of MDI appears accurate. It requires prospective studies assessing implementation to assist clinicians and parents/patients in individualised decision making.",,"['Phillips, Robert S', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Ammann, Roland A', 'Riley, Richard D', 'Castagnola, Elio', 'Haeusler, Gabrielle M', 'Klaassen, Robert', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Chisholm, Julia', 'Hakim, Hana', 'Ranasinghe, Neil', 'Paesmans, Marianne', 'Hann, Ian M', 'Stewart, Lesley A']","['Phillips RS', 'Sung L', 'Ammann RA', 'Riley RD', 'Castagnola E', 'Haeusler GM', 'Klaassen R', 'Tissing WJ', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Chisholm J', 'Hakim H', 'Ranasinghe N', 'Paesmans M', 'Hann IM', 'Stewart LA']","['Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.', 'Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Istituto G.

Overexpression of CXCR4 is a hallmark of many hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and generally correlates with a poor prognosis. In this study, we developed a humanized anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, LY2624587 as a potent CXCR4 antagonist that was advanced into clinical study for cancer. LY2624587 blocked SDF-1 binding to CXCR4 with an IC50 of 0.26 nM, and inhibited SDF-1-induced GTP binding with a Kb of 0.66 nM. In human lymphoma U937 and leukemia CCRF-CEM cells expressing endogenous CXCR4, LY2624587 inhibited SDF-1-induced cell migration with IC50 values of 3.7 and 0.26 nM, respectively. This antibody also inhibited CXCR4 and SDF-1 mediated cell signaling including activation of MAPK and AKT in tumor cells expressing CXCR4. Bifocal microscopic and flow cytometry analyses revealed that LY2624587 mediated receptor internalization and caused CXCR4 down-regulation on the cell surface. In human hematologic cancer cells, LY2624587 caused dose dependent apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In mouse xenograft models developed with human leukemia and lymphoma cells expressing high levels of CXCR4, LY2624587 exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and provided significant survival benefit in a disseminated lymphoma model.

SUMMARY: Ibrutinib is a first-in-class oral inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) approved for treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib blocks downstream signaling of the B-cell receptor, disrupting stromal microenvironment interactions and B-cell cytokine signaling. BTK inhibition has been shown to be effective in relapsed or refractory CLL. A recent Phase III study evaluated ibrutinib (420 mg daily) versus ofatumumab (consistent with labeling) in relapsed or refractory CLL with a primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS, n = 391). After a median follow-up period of 9.4 months, a PFS was not attained in ibrutinib-treated individuals with and without deletion 17p. In contrast, ofatumumab-treated individuals experienced a PFS of 8.1 months and those with deletion 17p experienced a PFS of 5.8 months. Major hemorrhage was reported in 2 (1%) patients treated with ibrutinib, and a total of 8 (4%) patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity or adverse reactions. Partial response or partial response with lymphocytosis was achieved in 63% of ibrutinib-treated individuals as determined by independent assessments. Overall, ibrutinib reduced the rate of mortality by 57%. CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, orally active, irreversible BTK inhibitor with a novel mechanism of action. This unique mechanism of action and high overall response rates observed in clinical trials make ibrutinib an attractive second-line option in patients who have disease progression while receiving monoclonal antibody therapy or chemoimmunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

The transition process is multifactorial and necessitates the joint involvement of the patient, the family and the healthcare providers. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of support from healthcare services during the transition from adolescence to adulthood described by young adult survivors of pediatric cancer. METHODS: A mixed method with a convergent parallel design was used to evaluate the experiences of receiving support from healthcare services (eg pediatric oncology and pediatric clinic) during transition from adolescence to adulthood described by young adult survivors of pediatric cancer (n = 213) in a nation wide cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: A quantitative assessment of the experienced extent and satisfaction of support from healthcare services to handle physical, mental and social changes to continue life after the disease showed that a majority of the participants had received insufficient support. The qualitative analysis indicated a need for equal roles in healthcare to promote participation, a need to manage and process consequences of the disease, and a need for continuous support. CONCLUSIONS: During transition to adulthood, there's a need for a personalized care plan that takes a holistic approach towards supporting the young cancer survivor in managing life in the best way. Identifying and handling the individual needs of pediatric cancer survivors is important for providing the resources and support required to increase the likelihood of successful transition to adulthood.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show that the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway functions downstream of STING and that STING agonists selectively trigger mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in normal and malignant B cells. Upon stimulation, STING was degraded less efficiently in B cells, implying that prolonged activation of STING can lead to apoptosis. Transient activation of the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway partially protected agonist-stimulated malignant B cells from undergoing apoptosis. In Emu-TCL1 mice with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, injection of the STING agonist 3'3'-cGAMP induced apoptosis and tumor regression. Similarly efficacious effects were elicited by 3'3'-cGAMP injection in syngeneic or immunodeficient mice grafted with multiple myeloma. Thus, in addition to their established ability to boost antitumoral immune responses, STING agonists can also directly eradicate malignant B cells. Cancer Res; 76(8); 2137-52.

Estimated number of new rare cancer cases yearly diagnosed (incidence), proportion of patients alive after diagnosis (survival), and estimated number of people still alive after a new cancer diagnosis (prevalence) are provided for about 200 different cancer entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data herein presented were provided by AIRTUM population- based cancer registries (CRs), covering nowadays 52% of the Italian population. This monograph uses the AIRTUM database (January 2015), which includes all malignant cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2010. All cases are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3). Data underwent standard quality checks (described in the AIRTUM data management protocol) and were checked against rare-cancer specific quality indicators proposed and published by RARECARE and HAEMACARE (www.rarecarenet.eu; www.haemacare.eu). The definition and list of rare cancers proposed by the RARECAREnet ""Information Network on Rare Cancers"" project were adopted: rare cancers are entities (defined as a combination of topographical and morphological codes of the ICD-O-3) having an incidence rate of less than 6 per 100,000 per year in the European population. This monograph presents 198 rare cancers grouped in 14 major groups. Crude incidence rates were estimated as the number of all new cancers occurring in 2000-2010 divided by the overall population at risk, for males and females (also for gender-specific tumours).The proportion of rare cancers out of the total cancers (rare and common) by site was also calculated. Incidence rates by sex and age are reported. The expected number of new cases in 2015 in Italy was estimated assuming the incidence in Italy to be the same as in the AIRTUM area. One- and 5-year relative survival estimates of cases aged 0-99 years diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 in the AIRTUM database, and followed up to 31 December 2009, were calculated using complete cohort survival analysis. To estimate the observed prevalence in Italy, incidence and follow-up data from 11 CRs for the period 1992-2006 were used, with a prevalence index date of 1 January 2007. Observed prevalence in the general population was disentangled by time prior to the reference date (</=2 years, 2-5 years, </=15 years). To calculate the complete prevalence proportion at 1 January 2007 in Italy, the 15-year observed prevalence was corrected by the completeness index, in order to account for those cancer survivors diagnosed before the cancer registry activity started. The completeness index by cancer and age was obtained by means of statistical regression models, using incidence and survival data available in the European RARECAREnet data. RESULTS: In total, 339,403 tumours were included in the incidence analysis. The annual incidence rate (IR) of all 198 rare cancers in the period 2000-2010 was 147 per 100,000 per year, corresponding to about 89,000 new diagnoses in Italy each year, accounting for 25% of all cancer. Five cancers, rare at European level, were not rare in Italy because their IR was higher than 6 per 100,000; these tumours were: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma of larynx (whose IRs in Italy were 7 per 100,000), multiple myeloma (IR: 8 per 100,000), hepatocellular carcinoma (IR: 9 per 100,000) and carcinoma of thyroid gland (IR: 14 per 100,000). Among the remaining 193 rare cancers, more than two thirds (No. 139) had an annual IR <0.5 per 100,000, accounting for about 7,100 new cancers cases; for 25 cancer types, the IR ranged between 0.5 and 1 per 100,000, accounting for about 10,000 new diagnoses; while for 29 cancer types the IR was between 1 and 6 per 100,000, accounting for about 41,000 new cancer cases. Among all rare cancers diagnosed in Italy, 7% were rare haematological diseases (IR: 41 per 100,000), 18% were solid rare cancers. Among the latter, the rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system were the most common (23%, IR: 26 per 100,000), followed by epithelial tumours of head and neck (17%, IR: 19) and rare cancers of the female genital system (17%, IR: 17), endocrine tumours (13% including thyroid carcinomas and less than 1% with an IR of 0.4 excluding thyroid carcinomas), sarcomas (8%, IR: 9 per 100,000), central nervous system tumours and rare epithelial tumours of the thoracic cavity (5%with an IR equal to 6 and 5 per 100,000, respectively). The remaining (rare male genital tumours, IR: 4 per 100,000; tumours of eye, IR: 0.7 per 100,000; neuroendocrine tumours, IR: 4 per 100,000; embryonal tumours, IR: 0.4 per 100,000; rare skin tumours and malignant melanoma of mucosae, IR: 0.8 per 100,000) each constituted <4% of all solid rare cancers. Patients with rare cancers were on average younger than those with common cancers. Essentially, all childhood cancers were rare, while after age 40 years, the common cancers (breast, prostate, colon, rectum, and lung) became increasingly more frequent. For 254,821 rare cancers diagnosed in 2000-2008, 5-year RS was on average 55%, lower than the corresponding figures for patients with common cancers (68%). RS was lower for rare cancers than for common cancers at 1 year and continued to diverge up to 3 years, while the gap remained constant from 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. For rare and common cancers, survival decreased with increasing age. Five-year RS was similar and high for both rare and common cancers up to 54 years; it decreased with age, especially after 54 years, with the elderly (75+ years) having a 37% and 20% lower survival than those aged 55-64 years for rare and common cancers, respectively. We estimated that about 900,000 people were alive in Italy with a previous diagnosis of a rare cancer in 2010 (prevalence). The highest prevalence was observed for rare haematological diseases (278 per 100,000) and rare tumours of the female genital system (265 per 100,000). Very low prevalence (<10 prt 100,000) was observed for rare epithelial skin cancers, for rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system and rare epithelial tumours of the thoracic cavity. COMMENTS: One in four cancers cases diagnosed in Italy is a rare cancer, in agreement with estimates of 24% calculated in Europe overall. In Italy, the group of all rare cancers combined, include 5 cancer types with an IR>6 per 100,000 in Italy, in particular thyroid cancer (IR: 14 per 100,000).The exclusion of thyroid carcinoma from rare cancers reduces the proportion of them in Italy in 2010 to 22%. Differences in incidence across population can be due to the different distribution of risk factors (whether environmental, lifestyle, occupational, or genetic), heterogeneous diagnostic intensity activity, as well as different diagnostic capacity; moreover heterogeneity in accuracy of registration may determine some minor differences in the account of rare cancers. Rare cancers had worse prognosis than common cancers at 1, 3, and 5 years from diagnosis. Differences between rare and common cancers were small 1 year after diagnosis, but survival for rare cancers declined more markedly thereafter, consistent with the idea that treatments for rare cancers are less effective than those for common cancers. However, differences in stage at diagnosis could not be excluded, as 1- and 3-year RS for rare cancers was lower than the corresponding figures for common cancers. Moreover, rare cancers include many cancer entities with a bad prognosis (5-year RS <50%): cancer of head and neck, oesophagus, small intestine, ovary, brain, biliary tract, liver, pleura, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid and lymphatic leukaemia; in contrast, most common cancer cases are breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, which have a good prognosis. The high prevalence observed for rare haematological diseases and rare tumours of the female genital system is due to their high incidence (the majority of haematological diseases are rare and gynaecological cancers added up to fairly high incidence rates) and relatively good prognosis. The low prevalence of rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system was due to the low survival rates of the majority of tumours included in this group (oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, and liver), regardless of the high incidence rate of rare epithelial cancers of these sites. This AIRTUM study confirms that rare cancers are a major public health problem in Italy and provides quantitative estimations, for the first time in Italy, to a problem long known to exist. This monograph provides detailed epidemiologic indicators for almost 200 rare cancers, the majority of which (72%) are very rare (IR<0.5 per 100,000). These data are of major interest for different stakeholders. Health care planners can find useful information herein to properly plan and think of how to reorganise health care services. Researchers now have numbers to design clinical trials considering alternative study designs and statistical approaches. Population-based cancer registries with good quality data are the best source of information to describe the rare cancer burden in a population.",,"['Busco, Susanna', 'Buzzoni, Carlotta', 'Mallone, Sandra', 'Trama, Annalisa', 'Castaing, Marine', 'Bella, Francesca', 'Amodio, Rosalba', 'Bizzoco, Sabrina', 'Cassetti, Tiziana', 'Cirilli, Claudia', 'Cusimano, Rosanna', 'De Angelis, Roberta', 'Fusco, Mario', 'Gatta, Gemma', 'Gennaro, Valerio', 'Giacomin, Adriano', 'Giorgi Rossi, Paolo', 'Mangone, Lucia', 'Mannino, Salvatore', 'Rossi, Silvia', 'Pierannunzio, Daniela', 'Tavilla, Andrea', 'Tognazzo, Sandro', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Vicentini, Massimo', 'Vitale, Maria Francesca', 'Crocetti, Emanuele', 'Dal Maso, Luigino']","['Busco S', 'Buzzoni C', 'Mallone S', 'Trama A', 'Castaing M', 'Bella F', 'Amodio R', 'Bizzoco S', 'Cassetti T', 'Cirilli C', 'Cusimano R', 'De Angelis R', 'Fusco M', 'Gatta G', 'Gennaro V', 'Giacomin A', 'Giorgi Rossi P', 'Mangone L', 'Mannino S', 'Rossi S', 'Pierannunzio D', 'Tavilla A', 'Tognazzo S', 'Tumino R', 'Vicentini M', 'Vitale MF', 'Crocetti E', 'Dal Maso L']","['Registro Tumori di popolazione della Provincia di Latina, azienda AUSL Latina, Latina.', 'Registro Tumori toscano, Istituto per lo studio e la prevenzione oncologica (ISPO), Firenze.', 'Centro nazionale di epidemiologia, sorveglianza e promozione della salute (CNESPS), Roma.', 'Epidemiologia valutativa, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto nazionale dei tumori (INT), Milano. tumori.rari@registri-tumori.it.', 'Registro Tumori Integrato Catania-Messina-Siracusa-Enna, Dipartimento G.F.

However, a substantial proportion of patients continue to die as a result of disease progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the minimal residual disease (MRD)-based effect and long-term outcome of first-line incorporation of dasatinib (100 mg once daily) into chemotherapy alternatively for adults with Ph-positive ALL. The primary end point was the major molecular response (MMR) rate by the end of the second dasatinib cycle. Patients with a donor proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) as early as possible. MRD monitoring was centrally evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (4.5-log sensitivity) using bone marrow samples. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (median age, 46 years) were enrolled and treated with this strategy. After the first dasatinib cycle, 50 patients (98.0%) achieved complete remission (CR). By the end of the second dasatinib cycle, 46 (93.9%) of 49 assessable patients had persistent CR, and 38 (77.6%) had MMR (32.7%) or undetectable MRD (44.9%). On the basis of the MRD kinetics by this time point, the numbers of early-stable, late, and poor molecular responders were 23 (46.9%), 15 (30.7%), and 11 (22.4%), respectively. Thirty-nine patients (76.5%) underwent allogeneic SCT in CR1. After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse and disease-free survival (DFS) rate for all patients were 30.0% and 52.0%, respectively, and the corresponding outcomes among those receiving allogeneic SCT in CR1 were 20.5% and 64.1%, respectively. Poor molecular responders had a higher risk of relapse and DFS than those of early-stable molecular responders. CONCLUSION: This dasatinib-based protocol was effective for achieving a good quality molecular response and durable DFS in adults with Ph-positive ALL.

The polycomb group family member B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (Bmi1) is overexpressed and involved in cancer progression in PDAC; however, its role in the multistep malignant transformation of human pancreatic duct cells has not been directly demonstrated. In this study, we stably expressed Bmi1 in a model of telomerase-immortalized human pancreatic duct-derived cells (HPNE) and showed that Bmi1 promoted HPNE cell proliferation, migration, and invasion but not malignant transformation. We then used mutant KRASG12D as a second oncogene to transform HPNE cells and showed that it further enhanced Bmi1-induced malignant potential. More importantly, coexpression of KRASG12D and Bmi1 caused anchorage-independent growth transformation in vitro but still failed to produce tumors in nude mice. Finally, we found that mutant KRASG12D induced HPNE-Bmi1 cells to undergo partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) likely via upregulation of snail. Knockdown of KRASG12D significantly reduced the expression of snail and vimentin at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level and further impaired the anchorage-independent growth capability of invasive cells. In summary, our findings demonstrate that coexpression of Bmi1 and KRASG12D could lead to transformation of HPNE cells in vitro and suggest potential new targets for diagnosis and treatment of PDAC.",,"['Chen, Shao-Jie', 'Chen, Yin-Ting', 'Zeng, Lin-Juan', 'Zhang, Qiu-Bo', 'Lian, Guo-da', 'Li, Jia-Jia', 'Yang, Ke-Ge', 'Huang, Chu-Mei', 'Li, Ya-Qing', 'Chu, Zhong-Hua', 'Huang, Kai-Hong']","['Chen SJ', 'Chen YT', 'Zeng LJ', 'Zhang QB', 'Lian GD', 'Li JJ', 'Yang KG', 'Huang CM', 'Li YQ', 'Chu ZH', 'Huang KH']","[""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Lihuili Hospital of Ningbo Medical Center, Ningbo, China.', ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Gastroenteropancreatic Surgery, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China. sumschuzhonghua@hotmail.com."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Yanjiang West Road No. 107, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China. huangkh@mail.sysu.edu.cn."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China. huangkh@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160308,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bmi1', 'EMT', 'KRAS', 'Pancreatic cancer', 'Snail']",2016/03/10 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/03/09 06:00'],"['2015/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-4840-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-4840-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Aug;37(8):11299-309. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-4840-5.

These mutations result in the production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), leading to a hypermethylation phenotype that dysregulates hematopoietic differentiation. In this study, we identified mutant R132H IDH1-specific gene signatures regulated by key transcription factors, particularly CEBPalpha, involved in myeloid differentiation and retinoid responsiveness. We show that treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at clinically achievable doses markedly enhanced terminal granulocytic differentiation in AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and a xenograft mouse model carrying mutant IDH1. Moreover, treatment with a cell-permeable form of 2-HG sensitized wild-type IDH1 AML cells to ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation, whereas inhibition of 2-HG production significantly reduced ATRA effects in mutant IDH1 cells. ATRA treatment specifically decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis of mutant IDH1 blasts in vitro. ATRA also reduced tumor burden of mutant IDH1 AML cells xenografted in NOD-Scid-IL2rgamma(null)mice and markedly increased overall survival, revealing a potent antileukemic effect of ATRA in the presence of IDH1 mutation. This therapeutic strategy holds promise for this AML patient subgroup in future clinical studies.",['(c) 2016 Boutzen et al.'],"['Boutzen, Helena', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Larrue, Clement', 'de Toni,

METHODS: We identified a retrospective cohort of 2-year survivors of AYA cancer who were diagnosed between the ages of 15 to 39 years (1998 to 2009) at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. A comparison group without cancer was selected and matched 10:1 to cancer survivors on the basis of age, sex, Kaiser Permanente Southern California membership, and calendar year. Patients were followed through December 31, 2012, for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. Time-dependent Poisson regression was used to evaluate the effect that cancer survivorship had on the risk of developing CVD, adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs; ie, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia), ethnicity, smoking, and overweight/obesity. Among cancer survivors, mortality risk by CVD status was examined using Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 5,673 2-year survivors of AYA cancer and 57,617 comparison patients were included, representing 24,839 and 239,073 person-years of follow-up, respectively. Overall, cancer survivors had more than two-fold risk of developing CVD (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.93 to 2.93) when compared with patients without cancer; survivors of leukemia and breast cancer were at the highest risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 4.23; 95% CI, 1.73 to 10.31; and 3.63; 95% CI, 2.41 to 5.47, respectively) of developing CVD. Having any of the CVRFs increased the risk of CVD in cancer survivors. Cancer survivors who developed CVD had an 11-fold increased overall mortality risk (hazard ratio, 10.9; 95% CI, 8.1 to 14.8) when compared with survivors without CVD. CONCLUSION: Survivors of AYA cancer are at increased risk for developing CVD. Survival after CVD onset is compromised, and CVRFs are independent modifiers of CVD risk. These data form the basis for identifying high-risk individuals and proactive management of CVRFs.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Chao, Chun', 'Xu, Lanfang', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Cooper, Robert', 'Brar, Somjot', 'Wong, F Lennie', 'Armenian, Saro H']","['Chao C', 'Xu L', 'Bhatia S', 'Cooper R', 'Brar S', 'Wong FL', 'Armenian SH']","['Chun Chao and Lanfang Xu, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena; Robert Cooper and Somjot Brar, Los Angeles Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Los Angeles; F.

METHODS: We enrolled seven age-matched unrelated patients with normocellular bone marrow for determining versican-producing cells in bone marrow, CBSCT-treated patients with AML, 18 with fine and other four with poor engraftment, for determining chronological alteration of versican-expressing and CD68-expressing cells in transplanted bone marrow in reference to the total cells. Clot samples of patients with AML were collected from the +16 to +55 day after transplantation and separated into four groups. We included an AML case whose specimen was obtained on the +9 day. Cells positive in immunohistochemistry using antibodies to versican and CD68 were counted to obtain the mean+/-SD in a unit area of the bone marrow, plotted chronologically and compared with the numbers from the age-matched normocellular group. RESULTS: We determined by a double immunohistochemistry that the versican-expressing cells in bone marrow are macrophages. The time-course curve demonstrated an inverse relationship between the versican-positive macrophages and the total cells in the transplanted bone marrow for over 55 days. In bone marrow of poor engraftment cases, versican-positive macrophages appeared to be decreased in comparison with age-matched and sampling day-matched patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that versican and/or versican-expressing macrophages positively contribute to bone marrow regeneration of patients with AML after CBSCT.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We performed a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate the association in variants of genes involved in oxidative stress, folate metabolism, DNA repair, and DNA methylation with susceptibility and prognosis of these malignancies. To that end, 16 SNPs (one per gene: CAT, CYBA, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, GPX1, KEAP1, MPO, MTRR, NEIL1, NFE2F2, OGG1, SLC19A1, SOD1, SOD2, and XRCC1) were genotyped in 191 patients (101 MDS and 90 AML) and 261 controls. We also measured oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species/total antioxidant status ratio), DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), and DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine) in 50 subjects (40 MDS and 10 controls). Results showed that five genes (GPX1, NEIL1, NFE2L2, OGG1, and SOD2) were associated with MDS, two (DNMT3B and SLC19A1) with AML, and two (CYBA and DNMT1) with both diseases. We observed a correlation of CYBA TT, GPX1 TT, and SOD2 CC genotypes with increased oxidative stress levels, as well as NEIL1 TT and OGG1 GG genotypes with higher DNA damage. The 5-methylcytosine levels were negatively associated with DNMT1 CC, DNMT3A CC, and MTRR AA genotypes, and positively with DNMT3B CC genotype. Furthermore, DNMT3A, MTRR, NEIL1, and OGG1 variants modulated AML transformation in MDS patients. Additionally, DNMT3A, OGG1, GPX1, and KEAP1 variants influenced survival of MDS and AML patients. Altogether, data suggest that genetic variability influence predisposition and prognosis of MDS and AML patients, as well AML transformation rate in MDS patients.

As a key transcription factor of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, LEF1 helps to regulate important genes involved in tumor cell death mechanisms. In this study, we determined LEF1 gene expression levels in CLL (n = 197) and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) (n = 6) patients through real-time RT-PCR. LEF1 was significantly up-regulated in both MBL and CLL patients compared with normal B cells. Treatment-free survival (TFS) time and overall survival (OS) time were much longer in CLL patients with low LEF1 expression than in those with high LEF1 levels. Furthermore, Wnt inhibitor ethacrynic acid (EA) induced both apoptosis and necroptosis in primary CLL cells. EA also enhanced the cytotoxicity of both fludarabine and cyclophosphamide against CLL cells in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated that EA functions by inhibiting the recruitment of LEF1 to DNA promoters and restoring cylindromatosis (CYLD) expression in CLL cells. Our results showed, for the first time, that high LEF1 expression is associated with poor survival for CLL patients.

The location and level of the BAFF/APRIL proteins in ALL cell lines were also detected by immunofluorescence cytochemistry and flow cytometry. Correlations between plasma protein levels of BAFF/APRIL and primary clinical parameters were analyzed. We found that BAFF/APRIL was highly expressed in pediatric ALL patients and ALL cell lines. The BAFF/APRIL proteins were located on the cell membrane, and the proportion of positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity were significantly higher than in the healthy control group (P<0.05). The mRNA expression and protein levels of BAFF/APRIL and their receptors in untreated ALL children were significantly higher than in healthy controls (P<0.05) as well as were significantly reduced in the remission group (P<0.05).

Abnormal levels of BAFF/APRIL in pediatric ALL suggest that BAFF/APRIL are associated with the development and progression of ALL in children and may provide information for the development of BAFF-based and APRIL-based targeted therapies.",,"['Sun, Baolan', 'Li, Lin', 'Xu, Meiyu', 'Wang, Xudong', 'Wang, Feng', 'Ni, Hongbing']","['Sun B', 'Li L', 'Xu M', 'Wang X', 'Wang F', 'Ni H']","[""*Department of Pediatrics double daggerLaboratory Medicine Center, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University daggerDepartment of Laboratory, Tongzhou Sixth People's Hospital, Nantong, Jiangsu, P.R.

Variations in the structure of MLL-ELL seem to influence the leukemogenic potency of the fusion in vivo and may lie behind differences in clinical features. The number of cases reported so far is very limited and the addition of more information about MLL-ELL variants is essential if the possible clinical significance of rare fusions is to be determined. CASE PRESENTATION: Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses were done on the bone marrow cells of a 20-month-old boy with an unusual form of myelomonocytic AML with multiple myeloid sarcomas infiltrating bone and soft tissues. The G-banding analysis together with FISH yielded the karyotype 47,XY, +6,t(8;19;11)(q24;p13;q23). FISH analysis also demonstrated that MLL was split. RNA-sequencing showed that the translocation had generated an MLL-ELL chimera in which exon 9 of MLL (nt 4241 in sequence with accession number NM_005933.3) was fused to exon 6 of ELL (nt 817 in sequence with accession number NM_006532.3). RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing verified the presence of the above-mentioned fusion transcript. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings and information on a few previously reported patients, we speculate that young age, myelomonoblastic AML, and the presence of extramedullary disease may be typical of children with rare MLL-ELL fusion transcripts.",,"['Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Gorunova, Ludmila', 'Kerndrup, Gitte', 'Spetalen, Signe', 'Tierens, Anne', 'Osnes, Liv T N', 'Andersen, Kristin', 'Muller, Lil-Sofie Ording', 'Hellebostad, Marit', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Heim, Sverre']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Gorunova L', 'Kerndrup G', 'Spetalen S', 'Tierens A', 'Osnes LT', 'Andersen K', 'Muller LS', 'Hellebostad M', 'Zeller B', 'Heim S']","['Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Nydalen, P.O.Box 4953, 0424 Oslo, Norway ; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Nydalen, P.O.Box 4953, 0424 Oslo, Norway ; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Laboratory Medicine Program, Department of Haematopathology, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Nydalen, P.O.Box 4953, 0424 Oslo, Norway ; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Radiology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Drammen Hospital, Vestre Viken HF, Drammen, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Nydalen, P.O.Box 4953, 0424 Oslo, Norway ; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ; Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160305,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC4779576,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chromosomal translocation', 'ELL', 'Fusion gene', 'MLL', 'Myeloid sarcoma', 'RNA-sequencing', 't(11;19)(q23;p13)']",2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/03/08 06:00'],"['2015/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-016-0037-2 [doi]', '37 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2016 Mar 5;5:8. doi: 10.1186/s40164-016-0037-2. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the function of Fe(II) in mammalian embryo development is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of Fe(II) during preimplantation embryo development. Depletion of Fe(II) using thiosemicarbazone-24 (TSC24), a specific Fe(II) chelator, rescued quenching of the Fe(II)-sensitive fluorophore phen green-SK. After in vitro fertilization, TSC24 significantly reduced the cleavage rate as well as blastocyst formation. The hatch rate of blastocysts was also reduced with 1 pM TSC24 treatment (20.25+/-1.86 versus 42.28+/-12.96%, p<0.05). Blastocysts were cultured in leukemia inhibitory factor-free mouse embryonic stem cell culture medium with or without TSC24, and those with depleted Fe(II) displayed delayed attachment and lost the ability to induce embryoid body formation. To further explore the mechanism of Fe(II) in embryo development, we assessed the expression of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and OCT4 in the pronuclear and blastocyst stages, respectively. We observed that Fe(II) reduced 5hmC and OCT4 expression, which could be explained by low ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme activity induced by TSC24 treatment. These findings demonstrate that Fe(II) is required for mammalian embryo development and that it facilitates the process via regulation of TET activity.",,"['Zhao, Ming-Hui', 'Liang, Shuang', 'Guo, Jing', 'Choi, Jeong-Woo', 'Kim, Nam-Hyung', 'Lu, Wen-Fa', 'Cui, Xiang-Shun']","['Zhao MH', 'Liang S', 'Guo J', 'Choi JW', 'Kim NH', 'Lu WF', 'Cui XS']","['1Department of Animal Sciences,Chungbuk National University,Cheongju 361-763,Republic of Korea.', '1Department of Animal Sciences,Chungbuk National University,Cheongju 361-763,Republic of Korea.', '1Department of Animal Sciences,Chungbuk National University,Cheongju 361-763,Republic of Korea.', '1Department of Animal Sciences,Chungbuk National University,Cheongju 361-763,Republic of Korea.', '1Department of Animal Sciences,Chungbuk National University,Cheongju 361-763,Republic of Korea.', '2College of Animal Science and Technology,Jilin Agricultural University,Changchun 130118,China.', '1Department of Animal Sciences,Chungbuk National University,Cheongju 361-763,Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160307,United States,Microsc Microanal,"Microscopy and microanalysis : the official journal of Microscopy Society of America, Microbeam Analysis Society, Microscopical Society of Canada",9712707,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Blastocyst/*drug effects', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Dioxygenases', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Ferrous Compounds/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Fe(II)', 'TET', 'embryo']",2016/03/08 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/08 06:00'],"['2016/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1431927616000040 [pii]', '10.1017/S1431927616000040 [doi]']",ppublish,Microsc Microanal. 2016 Apr;22(2):342-8. doi: 10.1017/S1431927616000040.

To accomplish this, proper integration of expert clinical and laboratory monitoring of CML patients is fundamental. Molecular response (MR) monitoring of patients at defined time points has emerged as an important success factor for optimal disease management and BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation screening is useful to guide therapeutic reassessment in patients who do not achieve optimal responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Deeper MRs might be associated with improved long-term survival outcomes. More importantly, they are considered a gateway to TFR. In molecular biology, novel procedures and technologies are continually being developed. More sophisticated molecular tools and automated analytical solutions are emerging as CML treatment endpoints and expectations become more and more ambitious.

In part two of the study, we aimed to confirm the pharmacokinetic non-inferiority of subcutaneous rituximab, and investigate its safety and efficacy. METHODS: We did this phase 1b, open-label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study at 68 centres in 19 countries in Europe, North America, South America, and Australasia. Patients aged 18 years or older with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were randomly assigned, via an interactive voice-response system with a permuted block randomisation scheme (block size of ten), to receive subcutaneous rituximab 1600 mg or intravenous rituximab 500 mg/m(2) plus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide every 4 weeks for up to six cycles. In cycle one, all patients received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m(2). Randomisation was stratified by Binet stage and fludarabine and cyclophosphamide administration route (oral vs intravenous). Study investigators and patients were not masked to group allocation, but allocation was concealed from the statistician, clinical scientist, and clinical pharmacologist. The primary endpoint was trough serum concentration at cycle five, with a non-inferiority margin of 0.8 for the adjusted geometric mean ratio of the subcutaneous to the intravenous dose. We did the primary analysis in patients in the intention-to-treat population with complete pharmacokinetic data (pharmacokinetic population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01292603, and is ongoing, although the treatment stage is now complete. FINDINGS: Between Aug 20, 2012, and June 17, 2013, we randomly assigned 176 patients to receive subcutaneous rituximab (n=88) or intravenous rituximab (n=88); 134 (76%) patients comprised the pharmacokinetic population. As of May 7, 2014, median follow-up was 13.9 months (IQR 11.9-16.0) for patients in the subcutaneous group and 14.1 months (11.6-16.5) for patients in the intravenous group. At cycle five, the geometric mean trough serum concentration in patients given subcutaneous rituximab was non-inferior to that in patients given intravenous rituximab (97.5 mug/mL vs 61.5 mug/mL), with an adjusted geometric mean ratio of 1.53 (90% CI 1.27-1.85). In the safety analysis, the proportion of patients reporting adverse events was similar between the subcutaneous and intravenous groups (all grades: 82 [96%] of 85 patients and 81 [91%] of 89 patients; serious adverse events: 25 [29%] and 29 [33%] patients; grade >/=3: 59 [69%] and 63 [71%] patients, respectively). The most common adverse event of grade 3 or higher was neutropenia (48 [56%] patients in the subcutaneous group and 46 [52%] patients in the intravenous group); the most common serious adverse event was febrile neutropenia (n=9 [11%] and n=4 [4%], respectively). We recorded administration-related reactions in 37 (44%) patients given subcutaneous rituximab and 40 (45%) patients given the intravenous dose, with differences between administration routes for injection-site erythema (n=10 [12%] and n=0, respectively) and nausea (n=2 [2%] and n=11 [12%], respectively). More patients reported local cutaneous reactions after subcutaneous rituximab (n=36 [42%]) than after intravenous rituximab (n=2 [2%]); most of these reactions were grade 1 or 2. INTERPRETATION: When combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, subcutaneous rituximab 1600 mg achieved trough serum concentrations that were pharmacokinetically non-inferior to those achieved with intravenous rituximab 500 mg/m(2), with a similar safety and efficacy profile between the two groups. Treatment with subcutaneous rituximab should allow patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia to receive clinical benefit from the drug via a more convenient delivery method than the intravenous route, and might also be used in combination regimens with approved and emerging oral regimens.

We aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide, an oral immunomodulator, in Japanese patients with relapsed adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma and other peripheral T-cell lymphomas. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we enrolled patients aged 20 years or older with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, documented diagnosis of aggressive adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma or other peripheral T-cell lymphoma subtypes, and at least one previous antilymphoma therapy. Patients were sequentially assigned to lenalidomide 25 mg/day, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle (cohort 1), 25 mg/day continuously (cohort 2), and 35 mg/day continuously (cohort 3) in a 3 + 3 design. The primary study endpoint was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide. Analyses were performed per protocol for efficacy and in the intent-to-treat patient population for safety. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01169298. FINDINGS: We enrolled 14 patients from six centres in Japan. Of 13 assessable patients (nine with adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma, four with other peripheral T-cell lymphomas) receiving lenalidomide, dose-limiting toxic effects were reported in three patients during cycle 1 (one grade 4 thrombocytopenia [cohort 2], one grade 3 QT prolongation on electrocardiogram [cohort 3], and one grade 3 fatigue and grade 4 thrombocytopenia [cohort 3]). The maximum tolerated dose was identified as lenalidomide 25 mg/day given continuously. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (eight [62%] patients), lymphopenia (seven [54%] patients), and thrombocytopenia (four [31%] patients); myelosuppression was similar in each cohort. Serious adverse events occurred in eight (62%) patients; thrombocytopenia, which occurred in three (23%) patients, was the only serious adverse event reported in more than one patient. INTERPRETATION: We were able to determine the dose and schedule for lenalidomide treatment in previously treated patients with aggressive, adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma. This dose will be used in a subsequent phase 2 study. FUNDING: Celgene Corporation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Response to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is out of the most important prognostic factors in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, only few data are available connecting GC response and role of autophagy. Our aim was to investigate whether altered expression of autophagy-related genes contributes to GC-resistant phenotype in GC-sensitive and GC-resistant precursor B-cell-type (PBC) ALL cells. METHODS: Gene expression data were obtained from public database for 26 children diagnosed with PBC ALL either sensitive or resistant to in vitro prednisolone treatment. RESULTS: We have identified 36 autophagy-associated genes which were differently expressed, based on at least a twofold difference, GC-sensitive group as compared to GC-resistant one. Of the 36 genes, 10 were downregulated and 26 upregulated in the GC-resistant group. The average fold change values for the decreased and increased transcripts were -4.57 and 2.67, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data imply that GC sensitivity might depend on the expression of several genes involved in regulation and execution of autophagy in a way that key autophagy inducers are downregulated while inhibitors of autophagy are upregulated in GC-resistant cells.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We investigated the importance of MCL-1 in the survival of B lymphoid progenitors undergoing MYC-driven transformation and its functional interactions with pro-apoptotic BIM and PUMA and the tumor suppressor p53 in lymphoma development. Loss of one Mcl-1 allele almost abrogated MYC-driven-lymphoma development owing to a reduction in lymphoma initiating pre-B cells. Although loss of the p53 target PUMA had minor impact, loss of one p53 allele substantially accelerated lymphoma development when MCL-1 was limiting, most likely because p53 loss also causes defects in non-apoptotic tumor suppressive processes. Remarkably, loss of BIM restored the survival of lymphoma initiating cells and rate of tumor development. Thus, MCL-1 has a major role in lymphoma initiating pro-B cells to oppose BIM, which is upregulated in response to oncogenic stress.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To increase awareness of this life-threatening infection, a case of cutaneous pythiosis is presented. We describe a middle-aged man with acute myeloid leukaemia who presented with necrotizing haemorrhagic plaques on his thighs after a weekend of freshwater boating. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen showed invasive fungal hyphae associated with dense perivascular inflammation and vessel damage. Diagnostic testing on tissue culture revealed growth of P. insidiosum. Despite multiple debridements and antifungal therapy, the patient died within 2 weeks of presentation. There are four clinical presentations reported in human pythiosis. Pythium insidiosum infection should be considered in any patient with a suggestive exposure history and fungal elements found on histological examination or in culture.

In this work, a novel sandwich-type dual-signal-marked electrochemical biosensor was fabricated for simultaneous detection of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) layers were used as substrate to immobilize Bcl-2 and Bax antibodies for further capturing target antigens. CdSeTe@CdS quantum dots (QDs) and Ag nanoclusters (NCs) with antibody modification and mesoporous silica amplification were used as signal probes, which were proportional to the amount of Bcl-2 and Bax antigens. Mesoporous SiO2 can provide a larger surface area, more effectively charged by ethylene imine polymer or poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) to adsorb more probes. The Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were determined indirectly by the detection of oxidation peak currents of Cd and Ag using anodic stripping voltammetry, showing a good linear relationship in the protein concentration range from 1 ng/mL to 250 ng/mL. The detection limit of trace protein level was approximately 0.5 fmol. The biosensor was further introduced to investigate Bcl-2 and Bax expressions from nilotinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. With the increase of drug dosage and incubation time, the up-regulation for Bax and down-regulation for Bcl-2 were observed, which indicated that the apoptosis level of K562 cells could be regulated by Bcl-2 family. The ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was further calculated for evaluation of its drug effect and apoptosis level. The limited cell amount for detection reached less than 1 x 10(3) cells, much lower than traditional methods. Furthermore, completely independent detection step and stable acid solutions containing Ag(+) and Cd(2+) for long-time storage contribute to reducing the error from the sample differences and avoiding the potential errors from the photodegradation of fluorescent probes, enzymolysis of DNA, or inactivation of enzyme during an excess experimental period.",,"['Zhou, Shiwei', 'Wang, Yingying', 'Zhu, Jun-Jie']","['Zhou S', 'Wang Y', 'Zhu JJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University , Nanjing 210093, P.

Vein thrombotic events may appear rarely but arterial thromboses are exceptionally rare. We present a patient with acute leukemia and bilateral deep leg vein thrombosis who developed an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during induction chemotherapy. The etiology and treatment of AMI in patients with acute leukemia, which is a rare occurrence, is discussed. CASE OUTLINE: In April of 2012 a 37-year-old male presented with bilateral deep leg vein thrombosis and malaise. Laboratory data were as follows: Hb 118 g/L, WBC 354 x 10(9)/L (with 91% blasts in differential leukocyte count), platelets 60x109/L. Bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype revealed the presence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis was as follows: 46,XY,t(4;11)(q21:q23) [2]/62-82,XYt(4;11)[18]. Molecular analysis showed MLL-AF4 rearrangement. The patient was on low molecular weight heparin and combined chemotherapy according to protocol HyperCVAD. On day 10 after chemotherapy he got chest pain. Three days later AMI was diagnosed (creatine kinase 66 U/L, CK-MB 13U/L, troponin 1.19 microg/L). Electrocardiogram showed the ST elevation in leads D1, D2, aVL, V5 and V6 and ""micro q"" in D1. On echocardiography, hypokinesia of the left ventricle and ejection fraction of 39% was found. After recovering from AMI and restoring left ventricle ejection fraction to 59%, second course of HyperCVAD was given. The control bone marrow aspirate showed 88% of blasts but with monoblastic appearance. Flow cytometry confirmed a lineage switch from lymphoblasts to monoblasts. In further course of the disease he was treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic combinations without achieving remission. Eventually, palliative chemotherapy was administered to reduce the bulk of blasts. He died five months after the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSION: AMI in young adults with acute leukemia is a very rare complication which may occur in patients with very high white blood cell count in addition with presence of a CD56 adhesion molecule and other concomitant thrombophilic factors. The treatment of AMI in patients with acute leukemias should include antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, even with more aggressive methods depending on patient's age and clinical risk assessment.",,"['Colovic, Natasa', 'Bogdanovic, Andrija', 'Virijevic, Marijana', 'Vidovic, Ana', 'Tomin, Dragica']","['Colovic N', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Virijevic M', 'Vidovic A', 'Tomin D']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects', 'Electrocardiography', 'Genes, Switch/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Leukocytosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Myocardial Infarction/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",,,,2016/03/08 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2016/03/08 06:00'],"['2016/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh1512734c [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2015 Nov-Dec;143(11-12):734-8. doi: 10.2298/sarh1512734c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technological advances have enabled the production of MABs that target specific antigens linked with several disease processes. These drugs are now a component of therapy, not only for many common malignancies, including breast, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancers, as well as lymphoma, leukaemia and multiple myeloma, but also for several inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Targeted therapy has raised new questions about tailoring treatment, including cancer management, to the individual patient's needs.

They persist into the adult forebrain where they can generate all cells in the neural lineage and therefore hold great potential for brain regeneration. Thus, pNSCs are an ideal population to target to promote endogenous NSC activation. pNSCs can be isolated from the periventricular region as leukaemia inhibitory factor-responsive cells, and comprise a rare population in the adult mouse brain. We hypothesized that the pup periventricular region gives rise to more clonal pNSC-derived neurospheres but that pup-derived pNSCs are otherwise comparable to adult-derived pNSCs, and can be used to identify selective markers and activators of endogenous pNSCs. We tested the self-renewal ability, differentiation capacity and gene expression profile of pup-derived pNSCs and found them each to be comparable to adult-derived pNSCs, including being GFAP(-) , nestin(mid) , Oct4(+) . Next, we used pup pNSCs to test pharmacological compounds to activate pNSCs to promote endogenous brain repair. We hypothesized that pNSCs could be activated by targeting the cell surface proteins C-Kit and ErbB2, which were enriched in pNSCs relative to definitive NSCs (dNSCs) in an in vitro screen. C-Kit and ErbB2 signalling inhibition had distinct effects on pNSCs and dNSCs in vitro, and when infused directly into the adult brain in vivo. Targeted activation of pNSCs with C-Kit and ErbB2 modulation is a valuable strategy to activate the earliest cell in the neural lineage to contribute to endogenous brain regeneration.",['(c) 2016 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Reeve, Rachel L', 'Yammine, Samantha Z', 'DeVeale, Brian', 'van der Kooy, Derek']","['Reeve RL', 'Yammine SZ', 'DeVeale B', 'van der Kooy D']","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, 160 College St. W. 1130, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, 160 College St. W. 1130, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160404,France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox2 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (glial fibrillary astrocytic protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Erbb2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism/physiology', 'Brain/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Ventricles/cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nestin/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism/physiology', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cell surface markers', '*endogenous activation', '*gene expression', '*neurogenesis']",2016/03/08 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2016/03/07 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejn.13228 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 2016 Jun;43(11):1474-85. doi: 10.1111/ejn.13228.

The interaction also plays an important role in the multistep process of leukemogenesis. Rac1 GTPase has been found to be highly expressed and activated in leukemia patients. Here, by forced expression of constitutively active form of Rac1 (Rac1-V12) in HSPCs, we demonstrate that active Rac1 promotes interaction of HSPC with niche. We then established an active Rac1 associated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model by expression of Rac1-V12 cooperated with AML1-ETO9a (AE9a) in mouse HSPCs. Compared with AE9a alone, Rac1-V12 cooperated with AE9a (AER) drives an AML with a short latency, demonstrating that activation of Rac1 GTPase in mice promotes AML development. The mechanism of this AML promotion is by a better homing and lodging of leukemia cells in niche, which further enhancing their colony formation, quiescence and preventing leukemia cells from apoptosis. Further study showed that an inhibitor targeting activated Rac1 can increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents to leukemia cells. This study provides evidence that activation of Rac1 promotes leukemia development through enhancing leukemia cells' homing and retention in niche, and suggests that inhibition of Rac1 GTPase could be an effective way of eliminating AML cells.

The delivery and insertion of a gene using lentiviral-based vectors involves multiple discrete steps, including reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA, nuclear entry, integration of viral DNA into the host genome and expression of integrated genes. Transduction of murine stem cells by the murine leukemia viruses is inefficient because the expression of the integrated DNA is profoundly blocked. Transduction of human stem cells by lentivirus vectors is also inefficient, but the cause and specific part of the retroviral lifecycle where this block occurs is unknown. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that the dominant point of restriction of an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector in adult human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow and also those obtained following peripheral mobilization is prior to viral DNA integration. We specifically show that restriction of HSPCs to an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector is prior to formation of nuclear DNA forms. CONCLUSIONS: Murine restriction of MLV and human cellular restriction of HIV-1 are fundamentally different.

The emergence of therapy-resistant escape variants is fuelled by intra-tumour heterogeneity, underpinned by interference and Darwinian evolution among continuously developing sub-clones in the mutating tumour. Novel cancer cell variants build upon the pre-existing genetic landscape and tumour heterogeneity is often ascribed largely to genetic variability. While mutations are required for cancer development and studies of genetic evolution of tumours have improved our understanding of cancer biology, genetics only represents one dimension of the fitness of each cancer cell. Beyond the mutations, several non-genetic factors also add significant variability, resulting in a complex and highly dynamic tumour cell population that can drive disease under almost any condition. This viewpoint article summarizes the genetic basis of intra-tumour heterogeneity, before dissecting four major interdependent non-genetic factors we think critically contribute to the overall variability of tumour cells in all types of cancer: epigenetic regulation, cellular differentiation hierarchies, gene expression stochasticity and tumour microenvironment. We finally present the relevant technological approaches to address the combined contribution of both genetic and non-genetic factors to intra-tumour heterogeneity, focusing on genomic profiling, cellular lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing technologies. This strategy will ultimately allow dissection of the full range and depth of intra-tumour heterogeneity. We thus believe that understanding how cancer genetics synergize with the emerging non-genetic factors will be key for development of therapies able to tackle tumour escape and thereby improve cancer patient survival.",['(c) 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],"['Caiado, Francisco', 'Silva-Santos, Bruno', 'Norell, Hakan']","['Caiado F', 'Silva-Santos B', 'Norell H']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160401,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,,IM,"['Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Fitness', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer mutation', '*cancer stem cells', '*clonal evolution', '*leukaemia initiating cells', '*lineage tracing', '*next-generation sequencing', '*non-genetic variability', '*population dynamics', '*single-cell transcriptomics', '*sub-clone']",2016/03/08 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/03/07 06:00'],"['2015/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/febs.13705 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2016 Jun;283(12):2245-58. doi: 10.1111/febs.13705.

This retrospective study included a comprehensive cohort of 302 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients with various cancers undergoing chemotherapy and antiviral prophylaxis. The rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during antiviral therapy (>1 log10 IU/mL increase or positive conversion of serum HBV DNA) and relapse when off antivirals ([re]appearance of HBV DNA >2,000 IU/ml with related alanine aminotransferase elevation) were evaluated, together with the associated risk factors, in a competing risks analysis where cancer death was considered as the competing event. During antiviral prophylaxis, HBV was reactivated in six patients (1.9%), who had leukemia (n = 4) or lymphoma (n = 2) and were treated with lamivudine (n = 4) or entecavir (n = 2). The incidence rate of HBV relapse in 127 off-prophylaxis patients was 21.3% during a median post-antiviral period of 11.7 months. Lymphoma, pre-prophylactic HBV DNA >/=2,000 IU/ml, and age >/=50 years were independent predictors of off-treatment HBV relapse (adjusted hazard ratios 5.25, 3.07, and 0.34, respectively; Ps < 0.05). Antiviral and anticancer drugs, duration of consolidation on antiviral prophylaxis, and HBeAg positivity were not independent predictors. In conclusion, hepatitis B flare-ups are not rare in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy during and after anti-HBV prophylaxis, even when potent antivirals are used. Patients with hematopoietic or lymphoid neoplasms or high viral burdens should receive prolonged and powerful HBV prophylaxis. J. Med. Virol. 88:1576-1586, 2016.

The direct methods to detect IDH mutations include DNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or by measuring its byproduct, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), in the blood or urine. Moreover, conventional magnetic resonance imaging can be modified to magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure 2-HG in tumor. By conducting a search in Medline/PubMed and ISI/Web of Science for the published articles in English related to the methods for detection of IDH mutations and its byproduct 2-HG, we compared different methodologies to detect these mutations and discuss advantages and limitations of each method. Studies in which a methodology of detection was compared with another modality were included. Multiple studies have shown that both DNA sequencing and IHC are reliable methods for detecting IDH mutations in glioma and other solid neoplasms. IHC appeared to be less costly, easier to perform, and may be slightly more accurate than DNA sequencing. 2-HG has also been measured in bone marrow aspirate, serum and urine of patients with mutant IDH acute myeloid leukemia, and correlated very well with sequencing and IHC. Lastly, in some glioma patients, MRS detected IDH mutations noninvasively and reliably with excellent correlations with other modalities such as IHC and sequencing. In conclusion, IHC, MRS, and 2-HG detection all are clinically useful and comparable with DNA sequencing in identifying IDH mutations in different neoplasms. 2-HG and MRS can be utilized for monitoring treatment response in a variety of neoplasms.",,"['Babakoohi, Shahab', 'Lapidus, Rena G', 'Faramand, Rawan', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Emadi, Ashkan']","['Babakoohi S', 'Lapidus RG', 'Faramand R', 'Sausville EA', 'Emadi A']","['*Marlene & Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD daggerMedical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Glutarates)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

In the year following generic entry, imatinib's price is expected to drop 70% to 90%. We hypothesized that initiating treatment with generic imatinib in these patients and then switching to the other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib or nilotinib, because of intolerance or lack of effectiveness (""imatinib-first"") would be cost-effective compared with the current standard of care: ""physicians' choice"" of initiating treatment with any one of the three TKIs. METHODS: We constructed Markov models to compare the five-year cost-effectiveness of imatinib-first vs physician's choice from a US commercial payer perspective, assuming 3% annual discounting ($US 2013). The models' clinical endpoint was five-year overall survival taken from a systematic review of clinical trial results. Per-person spending on incident CML-CP treatment overall care components was estimated using Truven's MarketScan claims data. The main outcome of the models was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We interpreted outcomes based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. A panel of European LeukemiaNet experts oversaw the study's conduct. RESULTS: Both strategies met the threshold. Imatinib-first ($277 401, 3.87 QALYs) offered patients a 0.10 decrement in QALYs at a savings of $88 343 over five years to payers compared with physician's choice ($365 744, 3.97 QALYs). The imatinib-first incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was approximately $883 730/QALY. The results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: When imatinib loses patent protection and its price declines, its use will be the cost-effective initial treatment strategy for CML-CP.",['(c) The Author 2016.

However, it remains unclear whether T-ALL subtypes differ at the functional level, and, as such, T-ALL treatments are uniformly applied across subtypes, leading to variable responses between patients. Here we reveal the existence of a subtype-specific epigenetic vulnerability in T-ALL by which a particular subgroup of T-ALL characterized by expression of the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 is uniquely sensitive to variations in the dosage and activity of the histone 3 Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase UTX/KDM6A. Specifically, we identify UTX as a coactivator of TAL1 and show that it acts as a major regulator of the TAL1 leukemic gene expression program. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UTX, previously described as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL, is in fact a pro-oncogenic cofactor essential for leukemia maintenance in TAL1-positive (but not TAL1-negative) T-ALL. Exploiting this subtype-specific epigenetic vulnerability, we propose a novel therapeutic approach based on UTX inhibition through in vivo administration of an H3K27 demethylase inhibitor that efficiently kills TAL1-positive primary human leukemia. These findings provide the first opportunity to develop personalized epigenetic therapy for T-ALL patients.",['(c) 2016 Benyoucef et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Benyoucef, Aissa', 'Palii, Carmen G', 'Wang, Chaochen', 'Porter, Christopher J', 'Chu, Alphonse', 'Dai, Fengtao', 'Tremblay, Veronique', 'Rakopoulos, Patricia', 'Singh, Kulwant', 'Huang, Suming', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Couture, Jean-Francois', 'Perkins, Theodore J', 'Ge, Kai', 'Dilworth, F Jeffrey', 'Brand, Marjorie']","['Benyoucef A', 'Palii CG', 'Wang C', 'Porter CJ', 'Chu A', 'Dai F', 'Tremblay V', 'Rakopoulos P', 'Singh K', 'Huang S', 'Pflumio F', 'Hebert J', 'Couture JF', 'Perkins TJ', 'Ge K', 'Dilworth FJ', 'Brand M']","['The Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8L6, Canada;

To define the effects of Id1 on leukemogenesis, we expressed MLL-AF9 in fetal liver (FL) cells or bone marrow (BM) cells isolated from wild-type, Id1(-/-), p21(-/-), or Id1(-/-)p21(-/-) mice, and transplanted them into syngeneic recipient mice. We found that although mice receiving MLL-AF9-transduced FL or BM cells develop AML, loss of Id1 significantly prolonged the median survival of mice receiving FL cells but accelerated leukemogenesis in recipients of BM cells. Deletion of Cdkn1a (p21), an Id1 target gene, can rescue the effect of Id1 loss in both models, suggesting that Cdkn1a is a critical target of Id1 in leukemogenesis. It has been suggested that the FL transplant model mimics human fetal-origin (infant) MLL fusion protein (FP)-driven leukemia, whereas the BM transplantation model resembles postnatal MLL leukemia; in fact, the analysis of clinical samples from patients with MLL-FP(+) leukemia showed that Id1 expression is elevated in the former and reduced in the latter type of MLL-FP(+) AML.

We characterized the biology and outcome of 55 HOXA-positive cases among 209 patients with adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia uniformly treated during the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL)-2003 and -2005 studies. HOXA-positive patients had markedly higher rates of an early thymic precursor-like immunophenotype (40.8% versus 14.5%, P=0.0004), chemoresistance (59.3% versus 40.8%, P=0.026) and positivity for minimal residual disease (48.5% versus 23.5%, P=0.01) than the HOXA-negative group. These differences were due to particularly high frequencies of chemoresistant early thymic precursor-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia in HOXA-positive cases harboring fusion oncoproteins that transactivate HOXA Strikingly, the presence of an early thymic precursor-like immunophenotype was associated with marked outcome differences within the HOXA-positive group (5-year overall survival 31.2% in HOXA-positive early thymic precursor versus 66.7% in HOXA-positive non-early thymic precursor, P=0.03), but not in HOXA-negative cases (5-year overall survival 74.2% in HOXA-negative early thymic precursor versus 57.2% in HOXA-negative non-early thymic precursor, P=0.44). Multivariate analysis further revealed that HOXA positivity independently affected event-free survival (P=0.053) and relapse risk (P=0.039) of chemoresistant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results show that the underlying mechanism of HOXA deregulation dictates the clinico-biological phenotype, and that the negative prognosis of early thymic precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia is exclusive to HOXA-positive patients, suggesting that early treatment intensification is currently suboptimal for therapeutic rescue of HOXA-positive chemoresistant adult early thymic precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

We report on the development and validation of the Quality of Life in Myelodysplasia Scale (QUALMS), a 38-item assessment tool for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In 2014-2015, a multi-center cohort of patients with myelodysplasia completed the QUALMS, as well as the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Anemia Scale (FACT-An); a second administration was undertaken three to six months later. A total of 255 patients from the United States, Canada and Italy participated. Median age was 72 years, 56.1% were men, and the International Prognostic Scoring System distribution was 40.4% low, 42.0% intermediate-1, 13.3% intermediate-2 and 2.3% high. QUALMS scores ranged from 24 to 99 (higher scores are better), with a mean of 67.2 [standard deviation (SD)=15.2]. The measure was internally consistent (alpha=0.92), and moderately correlated with the multi-item QLQ-C30 scales and the FACT-An (r=-0.65 to 0.79; all P<0.001). Patients with hemoglobin of 8 g/dL or under scored lower than those with hemoglobin over 10 g/dL (61.8 vs 71.1; P<0.001), and transfusion-dependent patients scored lower than transfusion-independent patients (62.4 vs 69.7; P<0.01). Principal components analysis revealed ""physical burden"", ""benefit-finding"", and ""emotional burden"" subscales. There was good overall test-retest reliability among those with stable hemoglobin (r=0.81), and significant changes for patients hospitalized or with infections between administrations (both P<0.01).

The CML is nowadays successfully treated with BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors as imatinib and its derivatives. NUMB is an evolutionary well-conserved protein initially described as a functional antagonist of NOTCH function. NUMB is an endocytic protein associated with receptor internalization, involved in multiple cellular functions. It has been reported that MSI2 protein, a NUMB inhibitor, is upregulated in CML blast crisis, whereas NUMB itself is downregulated. This suggest that NUMB plays a role in the malignant progression of CML. Here we have generated K562 cells (derived from CML in blast crisis) constitutively expressing a dominant negative form of NUMB (dnNUMB). We show that dnNUMB expression confers a high proliferative phenotype to the cells. Importantly, dnNUMB triggers a partial resistance to imatinib in these cells, antagonizing the apoptosis mediated by the drug. Interestingly, imatinib resistance is not linked to p53 status or NOTCH signaling, as K562 lack p53 and imatinib resistance is reproduced in the presence of NOTCH inhibitors. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that NUMB activation could be a new therapeutic target in CML.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Due to the morbidity and mortality of these events, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents are commonly employed as primary and/or secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, disease-related bleeding complications (i.e., from esophageal varices) are common in patients with MPN. This analysis was performed to define the frequency of such events, identify risk factors, and assess antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy in a cohort of patients with MPN. METHODS: The MPN registry of the Study Alliance Leukemia is a non-interventional prospective study including adult patients with an MPN according to WHO criteria (2008). For statistical analysis, descriptive methods and tests for significant differences as well as contingency tables were used to identify the odds of potential risk factors for vascular events. RESULTS: MPN subgroups significantly differed in sex distribution, age at diagnosis, blood counts, LDH levels, JAK2V617F positivity, and spleen size (length). While most thromboembolic events occurred around the time of MPN diagnosis, one third of these events occurred after that date. Splanchnic vein thrombosis was most frequent in post-PV-MF and MPN-U patients. The chance of developing a thromboembolic event was significantly elevated if patients suffered from post-PV-MF (OR 3.43; 95% CI = 1.39-8.48) and splenomegaly (OR 1.76; 95% CI = 1.15-2.71). Significant odds for major bleeding were previous thromboembolic events (OR = 2.71; 95% CI = 1.36-5.40), splenomegaly (OR = 2.22; 95% CI 1.01-4.89), and the administration of heparin (OR = 5.64; 95% CI = 1.84-17.34). Major bleeding episodes were significantly less frequent in ET patients compared to other MPN subgroups.

Here, we report that small-molecule Smac mimetics (i.e. BV6, LCL161, birinapant) that neutralize x-linked IAP (XIAP), cellular IAP (cIAP)1 and cIAP2 cooperate with demethylating agents (i.e. 5-azacytidine (5AC) or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC)) to induce cell death in ALL cells. Molecular studies reveal that induction of cell death is preceded by BV6-mediated depletion of cIAP1 protein and involves tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha autocrine/paracrine signaling, since the TNFalpha-blocking antibody Enbrel significantly reduces BV6/5AC-induced cell death. While BV6/5AC cotreatment induces caspase-3 activation, the broad-range caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) only partly rescues ALL cells from BV6/5AC-induced cell death. This indicates that BV6/5AC cotreatment engages non-apoptotic cell death upon caspase inhibition. Indeed, genetic silencing of key components of necroptosis such as Receptor-Interacting Protein (RIP)3 or mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) in parallel with administration of zVAD.fmk provides a significantly better protection against BV6/5AC-induced cell death compared to the use of zVAD.fmk alone. Similarly, concomitant administration of pharmacological inhibitors of necroptosis (i.e. necrostatin-1s, GSK'872, dabrafenib, NSA) together with zVAD.fmk is superior in rescuing cells from BV6/5AC-induced cell death compared to the use of zVAD.fmk alone. These findings demonstrate that in ALL cells BV6/5AC-induced cell death is mediated via both apoptotic and necroptotic pathways. Importantly, BV6/5AC cotreatment triggers necroptosis in ALL cells that are resistant to apoptosis due to caspase inhibition.

A high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay has been developed and applied to the pharmacokinetic study of the more active stereoisomer, S-AR-42, when administered via intravenous and oral routes in rodents, including plasma, bone marrow, and spleen pharmacokinetics (PK) in CD2F1 mice and plasma PK in F344 rats. Oral bioavailability was estimated to be 26 and 100% in mice and rats, respectively. R-AR-42 was also evaluated intravenously in rats and was shown to display different pharmacokinetics with a much shorter terminal half-life compared to that of S-AR-42. Renal clearance was a minor elimination pathway for parental S-AR-42.

Kruppel-like factor gene family members, such as Klf2, Klf4 and Klf5, have important roles in maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells as well as in cellular reprogramming, yet it is not known whether other Klf family members exert self-renewal and reprogramming functions when overexpressed. In this study, we examined whether overexpression of any representative Klf family member, such as Klf1-Klf10, would be sufficient for the self-renewal of mouse ES cells. We found that only Klf2, Klf4, and Klf5 produced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-independent self-renewal, although most KLF proteins, if not all, have the ability to occupy the regulatory regions of Nanog, a critical Klf target gene. We also examined whether overexpression of any of Klf1-Klf10 would be sufficient to convert epiblast stem cells into a naive pluripotent state and found that Klf5 had such reprogramming ability, in addition to Klf2 and Klf4. We also delineated the functional domains of the Klf2 protein for LIF-independent self-renewal and reprogramming. Interestingly, we found that both the N-terminal transcriptional activation and C-terminal zinc finger domains were indispensable for this activity. Taken together, our comprehensive analysis provides new insight into the contribution of Klf family members to mouse ES self-renewal and cellular reprogramming.",,"['Jeon, Hyojung', 'Waku, Tsuyoshi', 'Azami, Takuya', 'Khoa, Le Tran Phuc', 'Yanagisawa, Jun', 'Takahashi, Satoru', 'Ema, Masatsugu']","['Jeon H', 'Waku T', 'Azami T', 'Khoa le TP', 'Yanagisawa J', 'Takahashi S', 'Ema M']","['Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Human Biology Program, School of Integrative and Global Majors, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Ibaraki, 305-8575, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.', 'Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.', 'International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine, Life Science Center, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.', 'Animal Resource Center, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta, Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-1-8 Honcho Kawaguchi, Saitama, 332-0012, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160304,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Self Renewal', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Chimera', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Epitopes/metabolism', 'Germ Layers/cytology', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Multigene Family', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",PMC4778944,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0150715 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-48429 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Mar 4;11(3):e0150715. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0150715. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal therapeutic strategy for older adults with AML. Although selected older adults with AML can benefit from intensive therapies, recent evidence supports the use of lower-intensity therapies in most patients and emphasizes the importance of tolerability and quality of life. AREAS COVERED: Results of the current clinical trials and safety data are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Treatment recommendations for elderly patients with AML need to be individualized. In order to avoid toxicities, hematologists should collaborate more with geriatricians to identify clues of vulnerability in elderly patients through the study of functional physical, physiological, cognitive, social, and psychological parameters.",,"['Thomas, Xavier', 'Le Jeune, Caroline']","['Thomas X', 'Le Jeune C']","['a Hematology Department , Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital , Pierre-Benite , France.', 'a Hematology Department , Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital , Pierre-Benite , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160317,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', '*Quality of Life']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'elderly', 'hypomethylating agents', 'safety profile', 'targeted therapy']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740338.2016.1161020 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2016 May;15(5):635-45. doi: 10.1517/14740338.2016.1161020.

It was known that cigarette smoking can change the expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in healthy middle-aged adults. However, it remains unclear whether cigarette smoking can change the levels of circulating miRNAs in young healthy smokers and whether there are differences in cancer susceptibility for the two cases. In this study, the miRNA expression profiles of 28 smokers and 12 non-smokers were determined by Agilent human MicroRNA array. We further performed bioinformatics analysis for the differentially expressed miRNAs. The result showed that 35 miRNAs were differentially expressed. Among them, 24 miRNAs were up-regulated and 11 miRNAs were down-regulated in smokers. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the deregulated miRNAs are related to immune system and hormones regulation. Strikingly, the up-regulated miRNAs are mostly associated with hematologic cancers, such as lymphoma, leukemia. As a comparison, the up-regulated plasma miRNAs in middle-aged smokers are mostly associated with solid cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, suggesting that smoking could have different influences on young adults and middle-aged adults. In a conclusion, we identified the circulating miRNAs deregulated by cigarette smoking and revealed that the age-dependent deregulated miRNAs tend to be mainly involved in different types of human cancers.",,"['Shi, Bing', 'Gao, Hongmin', 'Zhang, Tianyang', 'Cui, Qinghua']","['Shi B', 'Gao H', 'Zhang T', 'Cui Q']","['Department of Cardiology, Beijing Military General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Respiratory, Beijing Military General Hospital No.263 Clinic, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Military General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Centre for Noncoding RNA Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/*genetics/pathology', '*Smokers', 'Smoking/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC5008314,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'cigarette smoking', 'expression profile', 'microRNA', 'plasma']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]']","['7866 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7866 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Apr 19;7(16):21676-85. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7866.,,,,,,,['The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests.'],,,,,,,,,

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in guiding the differentiation of stem cells to their destined lineage, and in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation has been well characterized as a significant contributing factor in the pathogenesis of a variety of cancers. Hematopoiesis is a process that is uniquely susceptible to epigenetic changes due to the small pool of actively cycling stem cells that give rise to the entire mature immune-hematopoietic system. Mutations in DNA methyltransferase enzymes have been shown to be initiating events in the development of hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and, therefore, have become targets for improved diagnostics and therapy. The spatial and temporal regulation of DNA methylation in the hematopoietic developmental hierarchy is critical to hematopoietic homeostasis. An improved understanding of the roles that DNA methylation plays in normal and malignant hematopoiesis will have a significant impact on the future of regenerative stem cell therapy and clinical treatment of hematopoietic malignancies.

While many genes and pathways necessary for regulating angiogenesis have been identified, those responsible for endothelial cell (EC) survival during angiogenesis remain largely unknown. We have investigated the in vivo role of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), a pro-survival member of the BCL2 family, in EC survival during angiogenesis. EC-specific deletion of Mcl1 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in EC apoptosis in the angiogenic vasculature and a corresponding decline in vessel density. Our results suggest this apoptosis was independent of the BH3-only protein BIM. Despite the known link between apoptosis and blood vessel regression, this was not the cause of reduced vessel density observed in the absence of endothelial MCL1. Rather, the reduction in vessel density was linked to ectopic apoptosis in regions of the angiogenic vasculature where EC proliferation and new vessel growth occurs.

Phospho-STAT3 was overexpressed in imatinib-resistant CML patients as relative to imatinib responsive ones. By activation of the STAT3 pathway, BCR-ABL can promote cell cycling, and inhibit differentiation and apoptosis. Ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27a) performs extra-ribosomal functions besides imparting a role in ribosome biogenesis and post-translational modifications of proteins. RPS27a can promote proliferation, regulate cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis of leukemia cells. However, the relationship between STAT3 and RPS27a has not been reported. In this study, we detected a significantly increased expression of STAT3 and RPS27a in bone marrow samples from CML-AP/BP patients compared with those from CML-CP. In addition, we also demonstrated that it was a positive correlation between the level of STAT3 and that of RPS27a. Imatinib-resistant K562/G01 cells expressed significantly higher levels of STAT3 and RPS27a compared with those of K562 cells. RPS27a could be transactivated by p-STAT3 through the specific p-STAT3-binding site located nt -633 to -625 and -486 to -478 of the RPS27a gene promoter in a dose-dependent manner. The transactivated RPS27a could decrease the percentage of apoptotic CML cells induced by imatinib. And the effect of STAT3 overexpression could be counteracted by the p-STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 or RPS27a knockdown. These results suggest that drugs targeting STAT3/p-STAT3/RPS27a combining with TKI might represent a novel therapy strategy in patients with TKI-resistant CML.",,"['Wang, Houcai', 'Xie, Bingqian', 'Kong, Yuanyuan', 'Tao, Yi', 'Yang, Guang', 'Gao, Minjie', 'Xu, Hongwei', 'Zhan, Fenghuang', 'Shi, Jumei', 'Zhang, Yiwen', 'Wu, Xiaosong']","['Wang H', 'Xie B', 'Kong Y', 'Tao Y', 'Yang G', 'Gao M', 'Xu H', 'Zhan F', 'Shi J', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu X']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Carver College of Medicine, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Carver College of Medicine, Iowa, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RPS27a protein, human)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Ubiquitins/*biosynthesis']",PMC4951316,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'RPS27a', 'STAT3', 'apoptosis', 'imatinib']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['7888 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7888 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Apr 5;7(14):18638-50. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7888.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hydralazine, an approved vasodilator and antihypertensive drug, has been recently shown to act as a DNA methylation inhibitor. Even though hydralazine is already tested in clinical cancer trials, its mechanism of antitumor action remains undefined. Here, we show that hydralazine induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in human p53-mutant leukemic T cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that hydralazine triggered the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by inducing Bak activation and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Hydralazine treatment further resulted in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, whereas a superoxide dismutase mimetic inhibited hydralazine-induced cell death. Interestingly, caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells or Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells were strongly resistant to hydralazine treatment, thereby demonstrating the dependence of hydralazine-induced apoptosis on the mitochondrial death pathway.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin allows additional chemotherapy to be delivered to the leukaemic cells without significantly adding to toxicity since the active agent is coupled to a monoclonal anti-CD33 antibody. It was approved by the FDA in 2000 for the treatment of elderly patients with relapsed CD33 positive AML at a dose of 9mg/m(2) on two days two weeks apart. Almost at once, questions were raised about its safety, with a particular liver signal, and it was voluntarily withdrawn from practice in 2010. Many groups have been examining the role of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy, usually at lower doses than originally recommended, with varying degrees of success and toxicity and gemtuzumab ozogamicin is now entering a period of rehabilitation.

Improving predictive accuracy requires understating of prediction limiting factors, such as the statistical methodology used, number and quality of features collected, or simply the population size. Using an in-silico approach (i.e., iterative computerized simulations), based on machine learning (ML) algorithms, we set out to analyze these factors. A cohort of 25,923 adult acute leukemia patients from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry was analyzed. Predictive objective was non-relapse mortality (NRM) 100 days following HSCT. Thousands of prediction models were developed under varying conditions: increasing sample size, specific subpopulations and an increasing number of variables, which were selected and ranked by separate feature selection algorithms. Depending on the algorithm, predictive performance plateaued on a population size of 6,611-8,814 patients, reaching a maximal area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.67. AUCs' of models developed on specific subpopulation ranged from 0.59 to 0.67 for patients in second complete remission and receiving reduced intensity conditioning, respectively. Only 3-5 variables were necessary to achieve near maximal AUCs. The top 3 ranking variables, shared by all algorithms were disease stage, donor type, and conditioning regimen.

However, when activating oncogenic signaling pathways or protective mechanisms against cell death are active, immune cells can also confer therapy resistance. Here, we analyzed the role of activated T and NK cells and released cytokines on tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib - mediated apoptosis induction and proliferation of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Incubation of CML cells with activated, but not with resting CD3(+) T cells or with activated NK cells significantly inhibited TKI-induced apoptosis induction in CML cells as quantified by nuclear fragmentation assays. Transwell experiments revealed a critical role for T or NK cell-derived cytokines for CML cell protection. Accordingly, CML cells treated with IFNgamma also showed a clearly reduced sensitivity to TKI-mediated cell death induction and inhibition of proliferation. In contrast, IFNalpha or other pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, such as TNFalpha and GM-CSF did not impair TKI-induced apoptosis in CML cells. On a molecular level, IFNgamma-exposed CML cells showed a significantly reduced caspase-3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage as well as an increased expression of anti-apoptotic molecule xIAP. Finally, IFNgamma diminished TKI-induced downregulation of Jak-2 and STAT-5 phosphorylation and increased nuclear expression of RUNX-1, which may at least in part contribute to the reduced sensitivity to TKI effects. Our results demonstrate that IFNgamma released by activated T or NK cells may interfere with the therapeutic effects of TKI in CML.

(Combretaceae).,78-82,10.4103/0974-8490.171103 [doi],"UNLABELLED: Lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors are the promising therapeutic target for treating a wide spectrum of inflammatory-related diseases such as cancer, asthma, lymphoma, leukemia, and autoimmune disorders. In the present study, the photochemical constituents and the anti-LOX potential of leaf galls of Terminalia chebula are evaluated to exemplify its further potential development as medicine. Extracts of T. chebula galls were tested for anti-LOX activity using linoleic acid as substrate and lipoxidase as an enzyme and also the total content of polyphenols with phytochemical analysis of the extract were determined. The presence of highest total phenolic and flavonoid content of 141 +/- 2.2 mg of gallic acid equivalent/g d.w and 125 +/- 1.4 mg of quercetin equivalent/g d.w and maximal LOX inhibitory activity (52.67%) at 800 mug/mL concentrations were identified in the ethanolic extracts of leaf galls of T.chebula. The higher LOX inhibitory activity was positively correlated to the high content of total polyphenols/flavonoids. The results of this study confirm the folklore use of T. chebula leaves gall extracts as a natural anti-inflammatory agent and justify its ethnobotanical use. Therefore, the results encourage the use of T. chebula leave gall extracts for medicinal health, functional food, and nutraceuticals applications. SUMMARY: The present investigation demonstrated promising anti-LOX proper-ties of T. chebula leaves gall extracts. Presumably, these activities could be attributed in part to the polyphenolic features of the extract, as there was a strong correlation of higher LOX inhibiting activities with that of high total phenolic and flavonoid content in the methanolic leaf gall extracts of T. chebula. The results of this study confirm the folklore use of T. chebula leaves gall extracts as a natural anti-inflammatory agent and justify the ethnobotanical approach in the search for novel bioactive com-pounds.",,"['Eshwarappa, Ravi Shankara Birur', 'Ramachandra, Yarappa Lakshmikantha', 'Subaramaihha, Sundara Rajan', 'Subbaiah, Sujan Ganapathy Pasura', 'Austin, Richard Surendranath', 'Dhananjaya, Bhadrapura Lakkappa']","['Eshwarappa RS', 'Ramachandra YL', 'Subaramaihha SR', 'Subbaiah SG', 'Austin RS', 'Dhananjaya BL']","['Department of Chemistry, School of Graduate Studies, Jain University, Chamrajpete, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Research Unit in Vrukshayurveda, A Division of Center for Advanced Studies in Biosciences, Jain University, Chamrajpete, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Department of Studies and Research in Biotechnology, Kuvempu University, Shankarghatta, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Studies and Research in Biotechnology, Kuvempu University, Shankarghatta, Karnataka, India.', 'Research Unit in Vrukshayurveda, A Division of Center for Advanced Studies in Biosciences, Jain University, Chamrajpete, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Research Unit in Vrukshayurveda, A Division of Center for Advanced Studies in Biosciences, Jain University, Chamrajpete, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Mysore, Mysore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Toxinology/Toxicology and Drug Discovery, Center for Emerging Technologies, Jain University, Kanakpura Taluk, Ramanagara, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Pharmacognosy Res,Pharmacognosy research,101558769,,,,PMC4753765,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-lipoxygenase', 'Antioxidant', 'Drug', 'Gallic acid', 'Galls', 'Plants', 'Terminalia chebula']",2016/03/05 06:00,2016/03/05 06:01,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0974-8490.171103 [doi]', 'PR-8-78 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacognosy Res. 2016 Jan-Mar;8(1):78-82. doi: 10.4103/0974-8490.171103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because they have to persist throughout an organism's life span, HSCs tightly regulate the balance between proliferation and quiescence. Here, we investigated the role of the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (plzf) in HSC fate using the Zbtb16(lu/lu)mouse model, which harbors a natural spontaneous mutation that inactivates plzf. Regenerative stress revealed that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs had a lineage-skewing potential from lymphopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, an increase in the long-term-HSC pool, and a decreased repopulation potential. Furthermore, oldplzf-mutant HSCs present an amplified aging phenotype, suggesting that plzf controls age-related pathway. We found that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs harbor a transcriptional signature associated with a loss of stemness and cell cycle deregulation. Lastly, cell cycle analyses revealed an important role for plzf in the regulation of the G1-S transition of HSCs.

Intriguingly, we found that UV light-inactivated HSV-1 (UV-HSV-1) is equally effective in promoting PBMC cytolysis of leukemic cells and is 1000- to 10 000-fold more potent at stimulating innate antileukemic responses than UV-inactivated cytomegalovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, reovirus, or adenovirus. Mechanistically, UV-HSV-1 stimulates PBMC cytolysis of leukemic cells, partly via Toll-like receptor-2/protein kinase C/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling, and potently stimulates expression of CD69, degranulation, migration, and cytokine production in natural killer (NK) cells, suggesting that surface components of UV-HSV-1 directly activate NK cells. Importantly, UV-HSV-1 synergizes with interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-2 in inducing activation and cytolytic activity of NK cells. Additionally, UV-HSV-1 stimulates glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation-dependent oxygen consumption in NK cells, but only glycolysis is required for their enhanced antileukemic activity. Last, we demonstrate that T cell-depleted human PBMCs exposed to UV-HSV-1 provide a survival benefit in a murine xenograft model of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

We analyzed the course of 21 HCL patients treated with vemurafenib outside of trials with individual dosing regimens (240-1920 mg/d; median treatment duration, 90 days). Vemurafenib treatment improved blood counts in all patients, with platelets, neutrophils, and hemoglobin recovering within 28, 43, and 55 days (median), respectively. Complete remission was achieved in 40% (6/15 of evaluable patients) and median event-free survival was 17 months. Response rate and kinetics of response were independent of vemurafenib dosing. Retreatment with vemurafenib led to similar response patterns (n = 6). Pharmacodynamic analysis of BRAF V600E downstream targets showed that vemurafenib (480 mg/d) completely abrogated extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation of hairy cells in vivo. Typical side effects also occurred at low dosing regimens. We observed the development of acute myeloid lymphoma (AML) subtype M6 in 1 patient, and the course suggested disease acceleration triggered by vemurafenib. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hotspot mutation (E545K) was identified in the AML clone, providing a potential novel mechanism for paradoxical BRAF activation. These data provide proof of dependence of HCL on active BRAF signaling. We provide evidence that antitumor and side effects are observed with 480 mg vemurafenib, suggesting that dosing regimens in BRAF-driven cancers could warrant reassessment in trials with implications for cost of cancer care.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Dietrich, Sascha', 'Pircher, Andreas', 'Endris, Volker', 'Peyrade, Frederic', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Follows, George A', 'Hullein, Jennifer', 'Jethwa, Alexander', 'Ellert, Elena', 'Walther, Tatjana', 'Liu, Xiyang', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Elter, Thomas', 'Brummer, Tilman', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Hermann, Michael', 'Herold, Michael', 'Weichert, Wilko', 'Dearden, Claire', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Seiffert, Martina', 'Hallek, Michael', 'von Kalle, Christof', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Gaehler, Anita', 'Andrulis, Mindaugas', 'Steurer, Michael', 'Zenz, Thorsten']","['Dietrich S', 'Pircher A', 'Endris V', 'Peyrade F', 'Wendtner CM', 'Follows GA', 'Hullein J', 'Jethwa A', 'Ellert E', 'Walther T', 'Liu X', 'Dyer MJ', 'Elter T', 'Brummer T', 'Zeiser R', 'Hermann M', 'Herold M', 'Weichert W', 'Dearden C', 'Haferlach T', 'Seiffert M', 'Hallek M', 'von Kalle C', 'Ho AD', 'Gaehler A', 'Andrulis M', 'Steurer M', 'Zenz T']","['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany;

Previous studies have shown evidence for association between risk of ALL and variation within IKZF1, ARID5B, CEBPE, CDKN2A, GATA3, and BM1-PIP4K2A genes. However, variants identified only account for <10% of the genetic risk of ALL. METHODS: We applied pathway-based analyses to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the California Childhood Leukemia Study to determine whether different biologic pathways were overrepresented in childhood ALL and major ALL subtypes. Furthermore, we applied causal inference and data reduction methods to prioritize candidate genes within each identified overrepresented pathway, while accounting for correlation among SNPs. RESULTS: Pathway analysis results indicate that different ALL subtypes may involve distinct biologic mechanisms. Focal adhesion is a shared mechanism across the different disease subtypes. For ALL, the top five overrepresented Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways include axon guidance, protein digestion and absorption, melanogenesis, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and focal adhesion (PFDR < 0.05). Notably, these pathways are connected to downstream MAPK or Wnt signaling pathways which have been linked to B-cell malignancies. Several candidate genes for ALL, such as COL6A6 and COL5A1, were identified through targeted maximum likelihood estimation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show distinct biologic pathways are overrepresented in different ALL subtypes using pathway-based approaches, and identified potential gene candidates using causal inference methods. IMPACT: The findings demonstrate that newly developed bioinformatics tools and causal inference methods can provide insights to furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of leukemia.

However, age-specific molecular alterations are becoming more evident and may signify the need to age-stratify treatment regimens. The NCI/COG TARGET-AML initiative used whole exome capture sequencing (WXS) to interrogate the genomic landscape of matched trios representing specimens collected upon diagnosis, remission, and relapse from 20 cases of de novo childhood AML. One hundred forty-five somatic variants at diagnosis (median 6 mutations/patient) and 149 variants at relapse (median 6.5 mutations) were identified and verified by orthogonal methodologies. Recurrent somatic variants [in (greater than or equal to) 2 patients] were identified for 10 genes (FLT3, NRAS, PTPN11, WT1, TET2, DHX15, DHX30, KIT, ETV6, KRAS), with variable persistence at relapse. The variant allele fraction (VAF), used to measure the prevalence of somatic mutations, varied widely at diagnosis. Mutations that persisted from diagnosis to relapse had a significantly higher diagnostic VAF compared with those that resolved at relapse (median VAF 0.43 vs. 0.24, P < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that 90% of the diagnostic variants with VAF >0.4 persisted to relapse compared with 28% with VAF <0.2 (P < 0.001). This study demonstrates significant variability in the mutational profile and clonal evolution of pediatric AML from diagnosis to relapse. Furthermore, mutations with high VAF at diagnosis, representing variants shared across a leukemic clonal structure, may constrain the genomic landscape at relapse and help to define key pathways for therapeutic targeting.

In therapy tests in mice, the primary tumor was successfully eradicated, but animals died due to formation of lethal metastases. We supposed that high activities of SUM-IAP detoxifying enzymes caused metastasis formation in the liver. Therefore, therapy tests with SUM-IAP in combination with cisplatin and N-methylformamide (NMF), which were not detoxified in the liver, were carried out. METHOD: Antitumor activity was assayed in female CD2F1 mice with advanced subcutaneously growing P388 mice leukemia cells. RESULT: The results of the therapy tests with SUM-IAP plus cisplatin were as expected: No formation of metastases and long-time survival of more than 100 days were observed; however, the toxicity was increased as measured by decrease in body weight and the number in leukocytes. The results of the tests in combination with NMF were surprising: Applying only half the dose of SUM-IAP used in the experiments with cisplatin, no metastases were found and long-time survivors did not show signs of additional toxicity. CONCLUSION: NMF strongly enhances the antitumor activity of the oxazaphosphorine cytostatic SUM-IAP in mice with subcutaneously growing P388 mice leukemia cells by an unknown mechanism of action.",,"['Voelcker, G']",['Voelcker G'],"['Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University Frankfurt Medical School, Frankfurt, Germany. voelckerdr@aol.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160303,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Formamides)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (SUM-IAP compound)', '0 (Thiazines)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Formamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Thiazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cisplatin', 'N-methylformamide', 'Oxazaphosphorine cytostatics', 'SUM-IAP']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/03/04 06:00,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-016-2132-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-016-2132-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Jun;142(6):1183-9. doi: 10.1007/s00432-016-2132-5.

We mapped insulated neighborhoods in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and found that tumor cell genomes contain recurrent microdeletions that eliminate the boundary sites of insulated neighborhoods containing prominent T-ALL proto-oncogenes. Perturbation of such boundaries in nonmalignant cells was sufficient to activate proto-oncogenes. Mutations affecting chromosome neighborhood boundaries were found in many types of cancer. Thus, oncogene activation can occur via genetic alterations that disrupt insulated neighborhoods in malignant cells.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Hnisz, Denes', 'Weintraub, Abraham S', 'Day, Daniel S', 'Valton, Anne-Laure', 'Bak, Rasmus O', 'Li, Charles H', 'Goldmann, Johanna', 'Lajoie, Bryan R', 'Fan, Zi Peng', 'Sigova, Alla A', 'Reddy, Jessica', 'Borges-Rivera, Diego', 'Lee, Tong Ihn', 'Jaenisch, Rudolf', 'Porteus, Matthew H', 'Dekker, Job', 'Young, Richard A']","['Hnisz D', 'Weintraub AS', 'Day DS', 'Valton AL', 'Bak RO', 'Li CH', 'Goldmann J', 'Lajoie BR', 'Fan ZP', 'Sigova AA', 'Reddy J', 'Borges-Rivera D', 'Lee TI', 'Jaenisch R', 'Porteus MH', 'Dekker J', 'Young RA']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Program in Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605-0103, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Program in Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605-0103, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Computational and Systems Biology Program, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Program in Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605-0103, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160303,United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic']",PMC4884612,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2016/04/02 06:00,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1126/science.aad9024 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 2016 Mar 25;351(6280):1454-1458. doi: 10.1126/science.aad9024.

They have been implicated in several fundamental biological processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis and stem cell maintenance. There is increasing evidence that microRNAs also play roles in cellular transformation and carcinogenesis by acting either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Recent studies introduced MIR376 as an important microRNA family for cancer formation and progression. The MIR376 family is located on human chromosome 14 and it has several members containing identical or similar seed sequences. Biological roles of family members were studied in different cancer settings, including gliomas, leukemia, breast and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, two MIR376 family members, namely MIR376A and MIR376B were implicated in the regulation of macroautophagy (autophagy herein). Since autophagy dysregulation underlies various diseases including cancer, it is essential to understand the role of the MIR376 family in this context.

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center within a large, academic medical center. PATIENTS: Three patients with high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia who received azacitidine. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Patient 1 presented with pericarditis after cycle 2 of azacitidine, patient 3 presented 3 weeks after completing cycle 5, and patient 2 presented during cycle 1. All patients were treated symptomatically and responded to corticosteroids. None of the patients were re-challenged with hypomethylating agents. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable adverse drug reaction (score of 6) for patients 1 and 3 and a possible adverse drug reaction (score of 3) for patient 2. CONCLUSION: With the exclusion of other common causes of pericarditis, we believe it is likely that azacitidine was responsible for the findings in our patients. Providers caring for patients receiving hypomethylating agents should consider this potential adverse drug reaction in the setting of unexplained chest pain or other clinical signs consistent with cardiotoxicity.","['(c) 2016 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Newman, Matthew', 'Malla, Midhun', 'Gojo, Ivana']","['Newman M', 'Malla M', 'Gojo I']","['Department of Pharmacy, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', ""Department of Internal Medicine, St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona."", 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160401,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chest Pain/etiology/prevention & control', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Pericarditis/*chemically induced/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['azacitidine', 'demethylating agent', 'leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'pericarditis']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/01/05 06:00,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1733 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2016 Apr;36(4):443-8. doi: 10.1002/phar.1733.

In this study, five types of HTLV-1 proviral sequences were detected in 11 different sites of the genome in a reference MT-2 cell line. The five types of HTLV-1 proviral sequences were one complete proviral genome, two types of proviruses with deletion of large internal viral sequences (5.3 and 3.9 kB), one provirus with a large deletion (6.2 kB) from 5'LTR to position 6257, and one provirus of LTR only. The provirus with identical deletion of large internal viral sequence (5.3 kB) was found to be integrated into six different sites (chromosomes). A complete provirus and three of four types of defective provirus were consistently detected in two other MT-2 cell lines cultured in different laboratories. Not only Tax/Rex RNA and HBZ RNA, but also the transcriptional product for a specific defective provirus, were detectable in all three MT-2 cell lines. Because it has been reported that defective provirus is frequently detected in ATL cells, these results may be important in understanding the mechanism of HTLV-1 proviral polymorphism, which may be related to leukemogenesis.

Measurement of scattered and reflected light offers a versatile and non-invasive measurement technique. Therefore, we investigated two methods to detect the formation of inclusion bodies and monitor their production: (1) online 180 degrees scattered light measurement (lambda = 625 nm) using a sensor platform during cultivation in shake flask and (2) online measurement of the light reflective interference using a porous Si-based optical biosensor (SiPA). It could be shown that 180 degrees scattered light measurement allows monitoring of alterations in the optical properties of Escherichia coli BL21 cells, associated with the formation of inclusion bodies during cultivation. A reproducible linear correlation between the inclusion body concentration of the non-fluorescent protein human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) carrying a thioredoxin tag and the shift (""Deltaamp"") in scattered light signal intensity was observed. This was also observed for the glutathione-S-transferase-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP-GST).

As HLA-E is also over-expressed in several haematological malignancies and CMV has been linked to a reduced risk of leukaemic relapse, we determined the impact of latent CMV infection on NK cell cytotoxicity against four tumour target cell lines with varying levels of HLA-E expression. NK cell cytotoxicity against K562 (leukaemia origin) and U266 (multiple myeloma origin) target cells was strikingly greater in healthy CMV-seropositive donors than seronegative donors and was associated strongly with target cell HLA-E and NK cell NKG2C expression. NK cell cytotoxicity against HLA-E transfected lymphoma target cells (221.AEH) was approximately threefold higher with CMV, while NK cell cytotoxicity against non-transfected 721.221 cells was identical between the CMV groups. NK cell degranulation (CD107a(+) ) and interferon (IFN)-gamma production to 221.AEH cells was localized almost exclusively to the NKG2C subset, and antibody blocking of NKG2C completely eliminated the effect of CMV on NK cell cytotoxicity against 221.AEH cells. Moreover, 221.AEH feeder cells and interleukin (IL)-15 were found to expand NKG2C(+) /NKG2A(-) NK cells preferentially from CMV-seronegative donors and increase NK cell cytotoxicity against HLA-E(+) tumour cell lines. We conclude that latent CMV infection enhances NK cell cytotoxicity through accumulation of NKG2C(+) NK cells, which may be beneficial in preventing the initiation and progression of haematological malignancies characterized by high HLA-E expression.",['(c) 2016 British Society for Immunology.'],"['Bigley, A B', 'Rezvani, K', 'Shah, N', 'Sekine, T', 'Balneger, N', 'Pistillo, M', 'Agha, N', 'Kunz, H', ""O'Connor, D P"", 'Bollard, C M', 'Simpson, R J']","['Bigley AB', 'Rezvani K', 'Shah N', 'Sekine T', 'Balneger N', 'Pistillo M', 'Agha N', 'Kunz H', ""O'Connor DP"", 'Bollard CM', 'Simpson RJ']","['Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Program for Cell Enhancement and Technologies for Immunotherapy, Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation and Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's National Health System, Washington, DC, USA."", 'Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD57 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/*analysis/immunology', '*Virus Latency', 'Young Adult']",PMC4955006,['NOTNLM'],"['*221 AEH', '*CD158', '*CD57', '*K562', '*NKG2A', '*U266', '*leukaemia', '*lymphoma', '*multiple myeloma']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/05/02 06:00,['2016/03/05 06:00'],"['2016/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cei.12785 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2016 Aug;185(2):239-51. doi: 10.1111/cei.12785.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, multiple myeloma cells are sensitive to antagonists that selectively target prosurvival proteins such as BCL-2/BCL-XL (ABT-737 and ABT-263/navitoclax) or BCL-2 only (ABT-199/GDC-0199/venetoclax). Resistance to these three drugs is mediated by expression of MCL-1. However, given the selectivity profile of venetoclax it is unclear whether coexpression of BCL-XL also affects antitumor responses to venetoclax in multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma cell lines (n = 21), BCL-2 is expressed but sensitivity to venetoclax correlated with high BCL-2 and low BCL-XL or MCL-1 expression. Multiple myeloma cells that coexpress BCL-2 and BCL-XL were resistant to venetoclax but sensitive to a BCL-XL-selective inhibitor (A-1155463). Multiple myeloma xenograft models that coexpressed BCL-XL or MCL-1 with BCL-2 were also resistant to venetoclax. Resistance to venetoclax was mitigated by cotreatment with bortezomib in xenografts that coexpressed BCL-2 and MCL-1 due to upregulation of NOXA, a proapoptotic factor that neutralizes MCL-1. In contrast, xenografts that expressed BCL-XL, MCL-1, and BCL-2 were more sensitive to the combination of bortezomib with a BCL-XL selective inhibitor (A-1331852) but not with venetoclax cotreatment when compared with monotherapies. IHC of multiple myeloma patient bone marrow biopsies and aspirates (n = 95) revealed high levels of BCL-2 and BCL-XL in 62% and 43% of evaluable samples, respectively, while 34% were characterized as BCL-2(High)/BCL-XL (Low) In addition to MCL-1, our data suggest that BCL-XL may also be a potential resistance factor to venetoclax monotherapy and in combination with bortezomib.

HA22 is in clinical trials to treat patients with hairy cell leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). LMB-11 is an improved variant of HA22 with reduced immunogenicity, has a longer half-life in the blood and high activity in vitro and in a Burkitt lymphoma model in vivo Searching for RIT enhancing combination therapies, we found the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 to enhance LMB-11 and HA22 activity 5- to 10-fold on ALL cell lines and on patient-derived ALL samples. In addition, H89 increased the activity of mesothelin-targeting RITs SS1P (38-fold) and RG7787 (7-fold) against the cervical cancer cell line KB31. Unexpectedly we found that the enhancement by H89 was not because of inhibition of protein kinase A; it was partially recapitulated by inhibition of S6K1, which led to inactivation of its downstream targets rpS6 and GSK3beta, resulting in a fall in MCL1 levels. H89 increased the rate of ADP-ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2, enhancing the arrest of protein synthesis and the reduction of MCL1 in synergy with the RIT. In summary, H89 increased RIT activity by enhancing the two key events: ADP-ribosylation of eEF2 and reduction of MCL1 levels.

Multiple HLA class I and class II restricted epitopes have been identified in WT1, and multiple investigators are pursuing the treatment of cancer patients with WT1-based vaccines and adoptively transferred WT1-reactive T cells. Here we isolated an HLA-A*0201-restricted WT1-reactive T-cell receptor (TCR) by stimulating peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy donors with the peptide WT1:126-134 in vitro. This TCR mediated peptide recognition down to a concentration of approximately 0.1 ng/mL when pulsed onto T2 cells as well as recognition of HLA-A*0201 target cells transfected with full-length WT1 cDNA. However, it did not mediate consistent recognition of many HLA-A*0201 tumor cell lines or freshly isolated leukemia cells that endogeneously expressed WT1. We dissected this pattern of recognition further and observed that WT1:126-134 was more efficiently processed by immunoproteasomes compared with standard proteasomes. However, pretreatment of WT1 tumor cell lines with interferon gamma did not appreciably enhance recognition by our TCR. In addition, we highly overexpressed WT1 in several leukemia cell lines by electroporation with full-length WT1 cDNA. Some of these lines were still not recognized by our TCR suggesting possible antigen processing defects in some leukemias. These results suggest WT1:126-134 may not be a suitable target for T-cell based tumor immunotherapies.",,"['Jaigirdar, Adnan', 'Rosenberg, Steven A', 'Parkhurst, Maria']","['Jaigirdar A', 'Rosenberg SA', 'Parkhurst M']","['NIH/NCI Surgery Branch, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology/metabolism']",PMC4883700,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000116 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2016 Apr;39(3):105-16. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000116.,,['Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS756228'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

NR4As play a key role in maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and are critical tumor suppressors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Expression of NR4As is broadly silenced in leukemia initiating cell enriched populations from human patients relative to normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Rescue of NR4A expression in human AML cells inhibits proliferation and reprograms AML gene signatures via transcriptional mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. By intersecting an acutely regulated NR4A1 dependent transcriptional profile with genome wide NR4A binding distribution, we now identify an NR4A targetome of 685 genes that are directly regulated by NR4A1. We show that NR4As regulate gene transcription primarily through interaction with distal enhancers that are co-enriched for NR4A1 and ETS transcription factor motifs. Using a subset of NR4A activated genes, we demonstrate that the ETS factors ERG and FLI-1 are required for activation of NR4A bound enhancers and NR4A target gene induction. NR4A1 dependent recruitment of ERG and FLI-1 promotes binding of p300 histone acetyltransferase to epigenetically activate NR4A bound enhancers via acetylation at histone H3K27. These findings disclose novel epigenetic mechanisms by which NR4As and ETS factors cooperate to drive NR4A dependent gene transcription in human AML cells.",,"['Duren, Ryan P', 'Boudreaux, Seth P', 'Conneely, Orla M']","['Duren RP', 'Boudreaux SP', 'Conneely OM']","['Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160303,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Computational Biology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Histones/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC4777543,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2016/07/29 06:00,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0150450 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-54573 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Mar 3;11(3):e0150450. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0150450. eCollection 2016.,,"['P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA160747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This meta-analysis aims to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of blood-based circulating miRNAs for leukemia. METHODS: We searched multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wan Fang Data and CQVIP) up to June 18, 2015. RESULTS: 32 studies from 10 publications were included in this meta-analysis. Diagnostic capacity was evaluated by pooled sensitivity, specifIcity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) through random-effects model. Sensitivity analyses were sequentially performed to find potential sources of heterogeneity. The quality of included studies was assessed by QUADAS (quality assessment for studies of diagnostic accuracy). Meta-Disc 1.4 and Stata 12.0 software were used to perform the meta-analysis. A high diagnostic accuracy was displayed, with a sensitivity of 0.84, a specificity of 0.88, a PLR of 7.20, a NLR of 0.18, a DOR of 52, and an AUC of 0.94. Subgroup analyses revealed better performance for combined miRNAs, acute myeloid leukemia patients and Asian population than other subgroups.

METHODS: All children born between 1973 and 2006 and diagnosed with a hematological malignancy before the age of 20 years (N = 1,819) were followed until 10 years from diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models estimating hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the impact of family characteristics on overall survival in children with hematological malignancies. RESULTS: Having siblings and increasing birth order were associated with reduced survival from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Associations with AML were strongest and statistically significant. HRs of 1.62 (CI 0.85; 3.09) and 5.76 (CI 2.01; 16.51) were observed for the fourth or later born children with ALL (N = 41) and AML (N = 9), respectively. Children with older parents showed a tendency toward inferior ALL survival, while for AML young maternal age was related to poorer survival. Based on small numbers, a trend toward poorer survival from non-Hodgkin lymphoma was observed for children having siblings and for children of younger parents. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is warranted to gain further knowledge on the impact of family factors on childhood cancer survival in other populations and to elaborate potential underlying mechanisms and pathways of those survival inequalities.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Erdmann, Friederike', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck', 'Dalton, Susanne Oksbjerg', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Zeeb, Hajo', 'Simony, Sofie Bay', 'Deltour, Isabelle', 'Ferro, Gilles', 'Bautz, Andrea', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Schuz, Joachim']","['Erdmann F', 'Winther JF', 'Dalton SO', 'Lightfoot T', 'Zeeb H', 'Simony SB', 'Deltour I', 'Ferro G', 'Bautz A', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Schuz J']","['Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Epidemiology & Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, Heslington, York, UK.', 'Department of Prevention and Evaluation, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology BIPS GmbH, Bremen, Germany.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France.', 'Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160303,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', '*Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Middle Aged', 'Paternal Age', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'childhood hematological malignancies', 'family characteristics', 'lymphoma', 'survival']",2016/03/05 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25950 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jun;63(6):1096-104. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25950.

Normally the death of cell and the growth are active processes and depend not only on external factors but also on the expression of genes such as Bcl-2, which activate and inhibit apoptosis. The term Bcl-2 is an acronym for B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 genes. It has been reported that there is deregulation of Bcl-2 expression during progression from oral epithelial dysplasia to squamous cell carcinoma. Expression of this oncoprotein can be detected by immunohistochemistry. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: An attempt was made to evaluate Bcl-2 oncoprotein expression in patients with oral precancer and cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A selective prospective clinical and immunohistochemical study. Clinicopathological examination was correlated with immunohistochemical findings. The immunolocalization of Bcl-2 protein was performed using the labeled streptavidin biotin method. To visualize the reaction, 3,3-diaminobenzidine was used. RESULTS: Bcl-2 expression was positive in 11 [36.66%, low Bcl-2 expression 3 (10.00%), moderate Bcl-2 expression 7 (23.33%), and high Bcl-2 expression 1 (3.33%)] oral cancer cases and 14 [87.50%, low expression 8 (50%), moderate expression 6 (37.50%)] precancer cases.

We have previously shown that the protein from a CD20 mRNA splice variant (D393-CD20) is expressed at various levels in leukemic B cells or lymphoma B cells but not in resting, sorted B cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors. RESULTS: Western blot (WB) analysis of B malignancy primary samples showed additional CD20 signals. Deep molecular PCR analysis revealed four new sequences corresponding to in-frame CD20 splice variants (D657-CD20, D618-CD20, D480-CD20, and D177-CD20) matching the length of WB signals. We demonstrated that the cell spliceosome machinery can process ex vivo D480-, D657-, and D618-CD20 transcript variants by involving canonical sites associated with cryptic splice sites. Results of specific and quantitative RT-PCR assays showed that these CD20 splice variants are differentially expressed in B malignancies. Moreover, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation modified the CD20 splicing profile and mainly increased the D393-CD20 variant transcripts. Finally, investigation of three cohorts of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients showed that the total CD20 splice variant expression was higher in a stage B and C sample collection compared to routinely collected CLL samples or relapsed refractory stage A, B, or C CLL. CONCLUSION: The involvement of these newly discovered alternative CD20 transcript variants in EBV transformation makes them interesting molecular indicators, as does their association with oncogenesis rather than non-oncogenic B cell diseases, differential expression in B cell malignancies, and correlation with CLL stage and some predictive CLL markers.

Recently, we have shown that clonal evolution and blast crisis correlate with altered expression and activity of Separase, a cysteine endopeptidase that is a mitotic key player in chromosomal segregation and centriole duplication. Hyperactivation of Separase in human hematopoietic cells has been linked to a feedback mechanism that posttranslationally stimulates Separase proteolytic activity after imatinib therapy-induced reduction of Separase protein levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: In search for potential therapy-responsive transcriptional mechanisms we have investigated the role of the transcription factor c-MYB for Separase expression in CML cell lines (LAMA-84, K562, BV-173) and in clinical samples. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot immunostaining experiments revealed that c-MYB expression levels are decreased in an imatinib-dependent manner and positively correlate with Separase expression levels in cell lines and in clinical CML samples. RNA silencing of c-MYB expression in CML cell lines resulted in reduced Separase protein levels. Gelshift and ChIP assays confirmed that c-MYB binds to a putative c-MYB binding sequence located within the ESPL1 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ESPL1/Separase is a regulatory target of c-MYB. Therefore, c-MYB, known to be required for BCR-ABL-dependent transformation of hematopoietic progenitors and leukemogenesis, may also control the Separase-dependent fidelity of mitotic chromosomal segregation and centriole duplication essential for maintenance of genomic stability.",,"['Prinzhorn, Wiltrud', 'Stehle, Michael', 'Kleiner, Helga', 'Ruppenthal, Sabrina', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang']","['Prinzhorn W', 'Stehle M', 'Kleiner H', 'Ruppenthal S', 'Muller MC', 'Hofmann WK', 'Fabarius A', 'Seifarth W']","['III.

However, standardizing ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometric analysis has proved unsatisfactory. The key point is that ZAP-70 is weakly expressed with a continuous expression pattern rather than a clear discrimination between positive and negative CLL cells, which means that the resulting judgment is subjective. Thus, in this study, we aimed at assessing the reliability and repeatability of ZAP-70 expression using the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (geo MFI) index method based on flow cytometry with 256-channel resolution in a series of 402 CLL patients and to compare ZAP-70 with other biological and clinical prognosticators. According to IgHV mutational status, we were able to confirm that the optimal cut-off point for the geo MFI index was 3.5 in the test set. In multivariate analyses that included the major clinical and biological prognostic markers for CLL, the prognostic impact of ZAP-70 expression appeared to have stronger discriminatory power when the geo MFI index method was applied. In addition, we found that ZAP-70-positive patients according to the geo MFI index method had shorter time to first treatment or overall survival (P=0.0002, P=0.0491). This is the first report showing that ZAP-70 expression can be evaluated by a new approach, the geo MFI index, which could be a useful prognostic method as it is more reliable, less subjective, and therefore better associated with improvement of CLL prognostication and prediction of clinical course.",,"['Wu, Yu-Jie', 'Wang, Hui', 'Liang, Jian-Hua', 'Miao, Yi', 'Liu, Lu', 'Qiu, Hai-Rong', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Wang, Rong', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Wu YJ', 'Wang H', 'Liang JH', 'Miao Y', 'Liu L', 'Qiu HR', 'Qiao C', 'Wang R', 'Li JY']","[""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160218,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC4762435,['NOTNLM'],"['ZAP-70', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'geometric mean fluorescence intensity index', 'prognosis']",2016/03/05 06:00,2016/03/05 06:01,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S94613 [doi]', 'ott-9-797 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Feb 18;9:797-805. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S94613. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improvements in front-line therapy, the outcome in these patients remains poor, especially after relapse. As there are no standard chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of patients with R/R B-precursor ALL, T-cell-based therapeutic approaches have recently come to the forefront in ALL therapy. Recently, monoclonal antibodies have been developed to target specific antigens expressed in B-lineage blast cells. In this setting, CD19 is of great interest as this antigen is expressed in B-lineage cells. Therefore, it has been selected as the target antigen for blinatumomab, a new bi-specific T-cell engager antibody. This sophisticated antibody binds sites for both CD19 and CD3, leading to T-cell proliferation and activation and B-cell apoptosis. Owing to its short serum half-life, blinatumomab has been administrated by continuous intravenous infusion with a favorable safety profile. The most significant toxicities were central nervous system events and the cytokine release syndrome. This new therapeutic approach using blinatumomab has been shown to be effective in patients with positive minimal residual disease and in patients with R/R B-precursor ALL leading to a recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration after an accelerated review process.

Despite characterization of the host factors that rely on SUMOylation to exert their antiviral effects, the enzymes that mediate these SUMOylation events remain to be defined. We show that unconjugated SUMO levels are largely maintained throughout infection regardless of the presence of ICP0, the HSV-1 SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, in the absence of ICP0, high-molecular-weight SUMO-conjugated proteins do not accumulate if HSV-1 DNA does not replicate. These data highlight the continued importance for SUMO signaling throughout infection. We show that the SUMO ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4 (PIAS4) is upregulated during HSV-1 infection and localizes to nuclear domains that contain viral DNA. PIAS4 is recruited to sites associated with HSV-1 genome entry through SUMO interaction motif (SIM)-dependent mechanisms that are destabilized by ICP0. In contrast, PIAS4 accumulates in replication compartments through SIM-independent mechanisms irrespective of ICP0 expression. Depletion of PIAS4 enhances the replication of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1, which is susceptible to restriction by the intrinsic antiviral immune response. The mechanisms of PIAS4-mediated restriction are synergistic with the restriction mechanisms of a characterized intrinsic antiviral factor, promyelocytic leukemia protein, and are antagonized by ICP0. We provide the first evidence that PIAS4 is an intrinsic antiviral factor. This novel role for PIAS4 in intrinsic antiviral immunity contrasts with the known roles of PIAS proteins as suppressors of innate immunity. IMPORTANCE: Posttranslational modifications with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins regulate multiple aspects of host immunity and viral replication. The protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family of SUMO ligases is predominantly associated with the suppression of innate immune signaling. We now identify a unique and contrasting role for PIAS proteins as positive regulators of the intrinsic antiviral immune response to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. We show that PIAS4 relocalizes to nuclear domains that contain viral DNA throughout infection. Depletion of PIAS4, either alone or in combination with the intrinsic antiviral factor promyelocytic leukemia protein, significantly impairs the intrinsic antiviral immune response to HSV-1 infection. Our data reveal a novel and dynamic role for PIAS4 in the cellular-mediated restriction of herpesviruses and establish a new functional role for the PIAS family of SUMO ligases in the intrinsic antiviral immune response to DNA virus infection.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Conn et al.'],"['Conn, Kristen L', 'Wasson, Peter', 'McFarlane, Steven', 'Tong, Lily', 'Brown, James R', 'Grant, Kyle G', 'Domingues, Patricia', 'Boutell, Chris']","['Conn KL', 'Wasson P', 'McFarlane S', 'Tong L', 'Brown JR', 'Grant KG', 'Domingues P', 'Boutell C']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom chris.boutell@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160414,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpes Simplex/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/chemistry/*genetics', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",PMC4836348,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2016/08/26 06:00,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03055-15 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03055-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Apr 14;90(9):4807-4826. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03055-15.

As such, this much smaller patient population has led to pediatric oncology drug development lagging behind that for adult cancers. Developing drugs for pediatric malignancies also brings with it a number of unique trial design considerations, including flexible enrollment approaches, age-appropriate formulation, acceptable sampling schedules, and balancing the need for age-stratified dosing regimens, given the smaller patient populations. The regulatory landscape for pediatric pharmacotherapy has evolved with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) legislation such as the 2012 FDA Safety and Innovation Act. In parallel, regulatory authorities have recommended the application of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, for example, in the recently issued FDA Strategic Plan for Accelerating the Development of Therapies for Pediatric Rare Diseases. PBPK modeling provides a quantitative and systems-based framework that allows the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on drug exposure to be modeled in a mechanistic fashion. The application of PBPK modeling in drug development for pediatric cancers is relatively nascent, with several retrospective analyses of cytotoxic therapies, and latterly for targeted agents such as obatoclax and imatinib. More recently, we have employed PBPK modeling in a prospective manner to inform the first pediatric trials of pinometostat and tazemetostat in genetically defined populations (mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged and integrase interactor-1-deficient sarcomas, respectively). In this review, we evaluate the application of PBPK modeling in pediatric cancer drug development and discuss the important challenges that lie ahead in this field.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Rioux, Nathalie', 'Waters, Nigel J']","['Rioux N', 'Waters NJ']","['Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts nwaters@syros.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160302,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (EPZ-5676)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Pyridones)', 'Q40W93WPE1 (tazemetostat)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Benzamides/pharmacokinetics', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacokinetics', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', '*Models, Biological', 'Morpholines', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Pediatrics/*methods', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pyridones/pharmacokinetics', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Young Adult']",,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2018/01/24 06:00,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['dmd.115.068031 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.115.068031 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2016 Jul;44(7):934-43. doi: 10.1124/dmd.115.068031.

Chronic exposure to benzene is known to cause aplastic anemia and increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia in humans. Although the mechanisms by which benzene causes toxicity remain to be fully elucidated, it is widely accepted that its metabolism is crucial to its toxicity, with involvement of one or more reactive metabolites. Novel approaches aimed at evaluating different mechanisms by which benzene can impact on human health by altering gene regulation have been developed. Among these novel approaches, epigenetics appears to be promising. The present review article summarizes the most important findings, reported from the literature, on epigenetic modifications correlated to benzene exposure. A computerized search in PubMed was performed in November 2014, using search terms, including 'benzene', 'epigenetic', 'histone modifications', 'DNA methylation' and 'microRNA'.

Several of the epigenomic changes observed in response to environmental exposures may be mechanistically associated with susceptibility to diseases.

Silencing of BMI-1 was shown to impair the growth and survival of MM cells. However, therapeutic agents specifically targeting BMI-1 were not available so far. Here, we investigated PTC-209, a novel small molecule inhibitor of BMI-1, for its activity in MM. METHODS: BMI-1 expression was analysed in human MM cell lines and primary MM cells by using publically available gene expression profiling (GEP) data. The anti-MM activity of PTC-209 was investigated by viability testing, cell cycle analysis, annexin V and 7-AAD staining, quantification of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), JC-1 as well as colony formation assays. Deregulation of central myeloma growth and survival genes was studied by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. In addition, the impact of PTC-209 on in vitro osteoclast, osteoblast and tube formation was analysed. RESULTS: We confirmed overexpression of BMI-1 in MM patients by using publically available GEP datasets. Of note, BMI-1 expression was further increased at relapse which translated into significantly shorter overall survival in relapsed/refractory patients treated with bortezomib or dexamethasone. Treatment with PTC-209 significantly decreased viable cell numbers in human MM cell lines, induced a G1 cell cycle arrest, promoted apoptosis and demonstrated synergistic activity with pomalidomide and carfilzomib. The anti-MM activity of PTC-209 was accompanied by a significant decrease of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) expression as well as upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B). We also observed upregulation of NOXA (up to 3.6 +/- 1.2-fold induction, P = 0.009) and subsequent downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) protein levels, which likely mediates the apoptotic effects of PTC-209. Importantly, the anti-MM activity was upheld in the presence of stromal support or myeloma growth factors insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). In the MM microenvironment, PTC-209 impaired tube formation, impaired osteoclast development and decreased osteoblast formation in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01 at 1 muM, respectively). The latter might be attributed to an induction of DKK1 and was reversed by concurrent anti-DKK1 antibody treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed overexpression of BMI-1 in MM highlighting its role as an attractive drug target and reveal therapeutic targeting of BMI-1 by PTC-209 as a promising novel therapeutic intervention for MM.",,"['Bolomsky, Arnold', 'Schlangen, Karin', 'Schreiner, Wolfgang', 'Zojer, Niklas', 'Ludwig, Heinz']","['Bolomsky A', 'Schlangen K', 'Schreiner W', 'Zojer N', 'Ludwig H']","['Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminenspital, Montleartstrasse 37, 1160, Vienna, Austria. arnold.bolomsky@extern.wienkav.at.', 'Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. karin.schlangen@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.schreiner@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminenspital, Montleartstrasse 37, 1160, Vienna, Austria. niklas.zojer@wienkav.at.', 'Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminenspital, Montleartstrasse 37, 1160, Vienna, Austria. heinz.ludwig@wienkav.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160302,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 2-Ring)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (PTC-209)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 2-Ring/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects/genetics', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects/genetics']",PMC4776359,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2016/10/25 06:00,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0247-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0247-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Mar 2;9:17. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0247-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyperin (quercetin-3-O-galactoside), a flavonoid compound and major bioactive component of the medicinal herb Apocynum venetum L., is commonly used to prevent endothelium dysfunction. However, its mode of action remains unclear. To the best of our knowledge, we have for the first time investigated the protective effect hyperin exerts against H2O2-induced injury in human endothelium-derived EA.hy926 cells using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)based quantitative proteomic analysis. The results showed that H2O2 exposure induced alterations in the expression of 250 proteins in the cells. We noted that the expression of 52 proteins associated with processes such as cell apoptosis, cell cycle and cytoskeleton organization, was restored by hyperin treatment. Of the proteins differentially regulated following H2O2 stress, the anti-apoptotic protein, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), and the pro-apoptotic protein, BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), exhibited marked changes in expression. Hyperin increased Mcl-1 expression and decreased that of Bid in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, flow cytometric analysis and western blot analysis of the apoptosis-related proteins, truncated BID (tBid), cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, Fas, FasL and caspase-8, demonstrated that the rate of apoptosis and the pro-apoptotic protein levels were decreased by hyperin pretreatment. In the present study we demonstrate that hyperin effectively prevents H2O2induced cell injury by regulating the Mcl1 and Bid-mediated antiapoptotic mechanism, suggesting that hyperin is a potential candidate for use in the treatment of thrombotic diseases.",,"['Liu, Xiao-Xia', 'Tang, Li', 'Ge, Rui', 'Li, Jian-Kuan', 'Kang, Ya', 'Zhu, Mei-Xia', 'Li, Qing-Shan', 'Hao, Xu-Liang']","['Liu XX', 'Tang L', 'Ge R', 'Li JK', 'Kang Y', 'Zhu MX', 'Li QS', 'Hao XL']","['Shanxi Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030012, P.R.

It has been suggested that omacetaxine mepesuccinate, used alone or with interferonalpha or cytarabine, induces remission in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. These effects are possibly mediated by its ability to induce apoptosis of leukemia cells and inhibit the activity of telomerase. To determine whether omacetaxine mepesuccinate is beneficial in diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL), two DLBCL cell lines [a germinal center B celllike subtype (GCB) and an activated B celllike subtype (ABC)] were treated with omacetaxine mepesuccinate at various concentrations for different durations. The present study indicated that omacetaxine mepesuccinate exerts proapoptotic effects in the two cell types in a dose and timedependent manner. The ABC subtype demonstrated increased sensitivity compared with the GCB subtype. At 40 ng/ml, omacetaxine mepesuccinate exhibited a marked proapoptotic effect on DLBCL cells compared with the other tumor cells investigated. Furthermore, omacetaxine mepesuccinate induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and promoted cell terminal differentiation of proB cells. The present study also demonstrated that omacetaxine mepesuccinate exerted its antitumor effect by reducing telomerase activity.

Autophagy protects cells from various stresses, including protecting normal cells from harmful metabolic conditions, and cancer cells from chemotherapeutics. In the current study, a cytarabine arabinoside (AraC)sensitive U937 leukemia cell line and an AraCresistant U937 (U937/AR) cell line were assessed for baseline autophagy activity by investigating the LC3I conversion to LC3II, performing EGFPLC3 puncta, an acidic autophagolysosome assay, and measuring the expression of various autophagyrelated genes. The results demonstrated significantly higher autophagic activity in the U937/AR cells compared with the U937 cells, when the cells were cultured with or without serum. Furthermore, an increase in the autophagic activity in starved U937/AR cells was demonstrated, compared with that in the starved U937 cells. Administration of an autophagy inhibitor demonstrated no change in cell death in the two cell lines when cultured with serum, however, it induced cell death regardless of the AraC sensitivity when the cell lines were cultured without serum. In addition, the U937 cells demonstrated an AraC resistance when cultured without serum. Cotreatment with AraC and the autophagy inhibitor significantly induced cell death in the U937/AR and AraCsensitive U937 cells. In conclusion, autophagy serves an important role in protecting U937 cells from AraC and in the development of AraC resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six studies published from December 2013 to December 2014 met the inclusion criteria for the present meta-analysis: 2 of an Asian and 4 of a non-Asian population. We assessed the biologic characteristics at diagnosis and investigated overall survival. The analyses were stratified by ethnic origin (Asian vs. non-Asian). RESULTS: A total of 816 patients with the JAK2 mutation and 307 patients with the CALR mutation were included. The patients with the JAK2 mutation were older than those with the CALR mutation, and no statistically significant difference was noted in the gender distribution of the patients with PMF with the JAK2 versus CALR mutation. Patients with JAK2-mutated PMF had a higher white blood cell count, but no statistically significant evidence was found for a difference in the platelet count or hemoglobin level. No difference was found in thrombosis risk or acute leukemic transformation in those 2 populations. Major differences were found between the Asian and non-Asian populations. The difference in characteristics between JAK2 and CALR was larger in the Asian population than in the non-Asian population (P = .007). Also, in the non-Asian population, those with JAK2 mutation had lower platelet counts than the Asians (P = .06). In the non-Asian population, the patients diagnosed with JAK2-positive PMF had worse overall survival than the patients with CALR-positive PMF, with a combined hazard ratio of 2.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.83-3.22). CONCLUSION: The results of the present meta-analysis have confirmed the role of the CALR mutation in the diagnosis of, and as a prognostic tool for, PMF. Our results suggest that patients with the CALR mutation will have better overall survival than patients with the JAK2 mutation in a non-Asian population.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Their pharmacological actions depend on biotransformation into active thioguanine-nucleotides; intracellular metabolism is mediated by enzymes of the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis and relies on polymorphic enzymes involved in thiopurines' catabolism such as thiopurine-S-methyl transferase. Given the enzymes involved in thiopurines' metabolism, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these drugs are able to induce significant oxidative stress conditions, possibly altering their pharmacological activity. METHODS: A systemic search of peer-reviewed scientific literature in bibliographic databases has been carried out. Both clinical and preclinical studies as well as mechanistic studies have been included to shed light on the role of oxidative stress in thiopurines' pharmacological effects. RESULTS: Sixty-nine papers were included in our review, allowing us to review the contribution of oxidative stress in the pharmacological action of thiopurines. Thiopurines are catabolized in the liver by xanthine oxidase, with potential production of reactive oxidative species and azathioprine is converted into mercaptopurine by a reaction with reduced glutathione, that, in some tissues, may be facilitated by glutathione- S-transferase (GST). A clear role of GSTM1 in modulating azathioprine cytotoxicity, with a close dependency on superoxide anion production, has been recently demonstrated. Interestingly, recent genome-wide association studies have shown that, for both azathioprine in inflammatory bowel disease and mercaptopurine in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, treatment effects on patients' white blood cells are related to variants of a gene, NUDT15, involved in biotransformation of oxidated nucleotides. CONCLUSIONS: Basing on previous evidences published in literature, oxidative stress may contribute to thiopurine effects in significant ways that, however, are still not completely elucidated.",,"['Pelin, Marco', 'De Iudicibus, Sara', 'Londero, Margherita', 'Spizzo, Riccardo', 'Dei Rossi, Sveva', 'Martelossi, Stefano', 'Ventura, Alessandro', 'Decorti, Giuliana', 'Stocco, Gabriele']","['Pelin M', 'De Iudicibus S', 'Londero M', 'Spizzo R', 'Dei Rossi S', 'Martelossi S', 'Ventura A', 'Decorti G', 'Stocco G']","['University of Trieste, Department of Life Sciences, Via A.

Some proinflammatory products e.g. TNF-alpha are crucial intermediates in axon regeneration, oligodendroglial renewal and remyelination. A more functional system of nomenclature classifies cytokines by their neuro 'protective' or 'suppressive' properties. Beyond the balance of these 'environmental' or 'extrinsic' signals, specific 'intrinsic' determinants of cytokine signalling appear to influence the outcome of axoglial regeneration. In this commentary, we examine the potential importance of cytokine-induced histone modification on oligodendrocyte differentiation. Neuroinflammation mediates the release of astrocytic leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and erythropoietin (EPO) which potentiates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin production. Meanwhile, histone deacetylation strongly suppresses important inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Given that LIF and EPO induce histone deacetylases in other systems, future studies should examine whether this mechanism significantly influences the outcome of cytokine-induced remyelination, and whether epigenetic drug targets could potentiate the effects of exogenous cytokine therapy.",,"['Roe, Cieron']",['Roe C'],"['Brighton and Sussex Medical School, The Audrey Emerton Building, Eastern Road, Kemp Town, Brighton, BN2 5BE, UK. c.roe1@uni.bsms.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160302,United States,Cell Mol Neurobiol,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Histone Code/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism']",PMC5226993,['NOTNLM'],"['Epigenetics', 'Histone modification', 'Myelination', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Neurotrophic cytokines', 'Oligodendrocytes', 'Therapy']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/02/14 06:00,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10571-016-0330-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10571-016-0330-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Neurobiol. 2017 Jan;37(1):1-4. doi: 10.1007/s10571-016-0330-y.

The developing cardiovascular system in children is thought to be highly susceptible to the toxic effects of chemotherapy, which causes damage to the blood vessel wall, including the endothelium. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a marker of endothelial damage, and it contributes to AH. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are derived from the bone marrow and participate in the process of blood vessel repair. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the rate of circulating EPCs and plasma levels of ET-1 with respect to hypertension in childhood ALL survivors. The study included 88 childhood ALL survivors and 44 healthy children as controls. All patients and controls had 24-h blood pressure monitoring with a HolCARD CR-07 device. The number of EPCs and the ET-1 serum concentration were measured in the peripheral blood of patients and controls using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. A correlation was found between the number of EPCs and the ET-1 concentration in the peripheral blood of healthy children and normotensive ALL survivors. However, such a correlation was not found in hypertensive childhood ALL survivors. We conclude that dysregulation of the 'ET-1 and EPC axis' may contribute to the development of AH in some childhood ALL survivors.",,"['Ociepa, Tomasz', 'Bartnik, Magdalena', 'Zielezinska, Karolina', 'Prokowska, Mai', 'Urasinska, Elzbieta', 'Urasinski, Tomasz']","['Ociepa T', 'Bartnik M', 'Zielezinska K', 'Prokowska M', 'Urasinska E', 'Urasinski T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160303,England,Hypertens Res,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,9307690,['0 (Endothelin-1)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Pressure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Endothelial Progenitor Cells', 'Endothelin-1/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*blood/etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Survivors']",,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['hr201622 [pii]', '10.1038/hr.2016.22 [doi]']",ppublish,Hypertens Res. 2016 Jul;39(7):530-5. doi: 10.1038/hr.2016.22.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of PD has not been fully elucidated. The present study demonstrated that PD significantly inhibited the proliferation of the MOLT-4 leukemia cell line in a dose and time-dependent manner by using Cell Counting Kit8 assay. PD also dose-dependently increased the apoptotic rate and caused cell cycle arrest in S phase in MOLT4 cells, as revealed by flow cytometry. In addition, PD dose-dependently decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and led to the generation of reactive oxygen species in MOLT-4 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was decreased, whereas that of proapoptotic protein Bcl2associated X was increased by PD. Furthermore, the expression of two cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin D1 and cyclin B1, was suppressed by PD. Of note, the proapoptotic and cell cycleinhibitory effects of PD were potentiated by Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibition.

Hematogones (HGs) are normal B-lymphocyte precursors that increase in hematological diseases and may influence remission duration in AML. HG detection was prospectively investigated in 262 AML patients to determine its prognostic value. Flow cytometric HG detection was performed in bone marrow aspiration after intensive chemotherapy at the time of hematological recovery. Patients with HGs in bone marrow samples had a significantly better relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients without HGs (P = 0.0021, and P = 0.0016). Detectable HGs independently predicted RFS (HR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.42 - 0.89, P = 0.012) and OS (HR = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.38 - 0.92, 0.019) controlling for age, ELN classification, the number of chemotherapy cycles to achieve CR, performance status, secondary AML and flow cytometric minimal residual disease (MRD). In intensively treated AML, individual determination of HGs could be useful to stratify the optimal risk-adapted therapeutic strategy after induction chemotherapy. Am. J. Hematol. 91:566-570, 2016.

High EDAG-1 expression is also found in human thyroid cancer cells and peripheral blood of patients with leukemia, but its functional significance was unclear. Current study aims to further clarify the expression pattern of EDAG-1 and tests its roles in proliferation and invasion of human thyroid cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. To this end, we have performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies to clarify how EDAG-1 regulates the proliferation, invasion, and adhesion ability of human thyroid cancer cells SW579cells.

The IRE1alpha-XBP1 pathway, a key branch of the UPR, is activated in many cancers. Here, we show that the expression of both mature and spliced forms of XBP1 (XBP1s) is up-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and AML patient samples. IRE1alpha RNase inhibitors [MKC-3946, 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (HNA), STF-083010 and toyocamycin] blocked XBP1 mRNA splicing and exhibited cytotoxicity against AML cells. IRE1alpha inhibition induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest at least partially by regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, G1 phase controlling proteins (p21cip1, p27kip1 and cyclin D1), as well as chaperone proteins. Xbp1 deleted murine bone marrow cells were resistant to growth inhibition by IRE1alpha inhibitors. Combination of HNA with either bortezomib or AS2O3 was synergistic in AML cytotoxicity associated with induction of p-JNK and reduction of p-PI3K and p-MAPK. Inhibition of IRE1alpha RNase activity increased expression of many miRs in AML cells including miR-34a. Inhibition of miR-34a conferred cellular resistance to HNA.

The in vitro efficacy of tefinostat was characterised in cell lines and in a cohort of 73 primary AML and CMML samples. Dose-dependent induction of apoptosis and significant growth inhibitory effects were seen in myelomonocytic (M4), monocytic/monoblastic (M5) and CMML samples in comparison to non-monocytoid AML sub-types (p = 0.007). Importantly, no growth inhibitory effects were seen in normal bone marrow CD34+ cells exposed to AML-toxic doses of tefinostat in clonogenic assays. Expression of hCE-1 was measured by intracellular flow cytometry and immunoblotting across the cohort, with highest levels seen in M5 AML patients. hCE-1 levels correlated with significantly increased tefinostat sensitivity (low EC50) as measured by growth inhibition assays (p = 0.001) and concomitant elevation of the mature monocytoid marker CD14+. Strong induction of intracellular histone protein acetylation was observed in tefinostat-responsive samples, as were high levels of the DNA damage sensor gamma-H2A.X, highlighting potential biomarkers of patient responsiveness. Synergistic interaction between tefinostat and the current standard treatment cytarabine was demonstrated in dose response and clonogenic assays using simultaneous drug addition in primary samples (median Combination Index value = 0.51).

As such, there is growing evidence that disturbances in physiological Notch signaling contribute to cancer development and growth through various mechanisms. Notch was first reported to contribute to tumorigenesis in the early 90s, through identification of the involvement of the Notch1 gene in the chromosomal translocation t(7;9)(q34;q34.3), found in a small subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Since then, Notch mutations and aberrant Notch signaling have been reported in numerous other precursor and mature hematological malignancies, of both myeloid and lymphoid origin, as well as many epithelial tumor types. Of note, Notch has been reported to have both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles, dependent on the cancer cell type. In this review, we will first give a general description of the Notch signaling pathway, and its physiologic role in hematopoiesis. Next, we will review the role of aberrant Notch signaling in several hematological malignancies.

Unfortunately, there are some issues TKIs are not able to address; first of all TKIs are not so effective in increasing survival of patients in blast crisis, second they are not able to eradicate leukemic stem cells (LSC) which represent the major cause of disease relapse, and third patients often develop resistance to TKIs due to mutations in the drug binding site. For all these reasons it's of primary interest to find alternative strategies to treat CML. Literature shows that Hedgehog signaling pathway is involved in LSC maintenance, and pharmacological inhibition of Smoothened (SMO), one of the key molecules of the pathway, has been demonstrated to reduce Bcr-Abl positive bone marrow cells and LSC. Consequently, targeting SMO could be a promising way to develop a new treatment strategy for CML overcoming the limitations of current therapies. In our work we have tested some compounds able to inhibit SMO, and among them MRT92 appears to be a very potent SMO antagonist. We found that almost all our compounds were able to reduce Gli1 protein levels in K-562 and in KU-812 CML cell lines. Furthermore, they were also able to increase Gli1 and SMO RNA levels, and to reduce cell proliferation and induce apoptosis/autophagy in both the tested cell lines. Finally, we demonstrated that our compounds were able to modulate the expression of some miRNAs related to Hedgehog pathway such as miR-324-5p and miR-326. Being Hedgehog pathway deeply implicated in the mechanisms of CML we may conclude that it could be a good therapeutic target for CML and our compounds seem to be promising antagonists of such pathway.",,"['Chiarenza, Alessandra', 'Manetti, Fabrizio', 'Petricci, Elena', 'Ruat, Martial', 'Naldini, Antonella', 'Taddei, Maurizio', 'Carraro, Fabio']","['Chiarenza A', 'Manetti F', 'Petricci E', 'Ruat M', 'Naldini A', 'Taddei M', 'Carraro F']","['Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'CNRS, UMR-9197, Neuroscience Paris- Saclay Institute, Molecules Circuits Department, Signal Transduction and Developmental Neuropharmacology Team, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.', 'Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Istituto Toscano Tumori, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160302,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (SMO protein, human)', '0 (Smoothened Receptor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smoothened Receptor']",PMC4774938,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2016/03/03 06:00'],"['2015/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0149919 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-49157 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Mar 2;11(3):e0149919. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0149919. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exome sequencing of the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells identified a KRAS G13C mutation. Interestingly, the KRAS G13C mutation was observed in T and B lymphocytes, as well as natural killer cells, but not granulocytes. Our case was completely phenotypically different from RASopathies and did not meet the criteria for Ras-associated lymphoproliferative disease or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

AIMS: To compare the heart rate reserve (HRR) and percent of 220-age methods for prescribing cycle ergometry exercise intensity using heart rate (HR) against the HRs obtained during a CPET in adults undergoing treatment for acute leukemia (AL). METHODS: In this exploratory study, part of a larger randomized controlled trial, 14 adults with AL completed CPET on a cycle ergometer with indirect calorimetry within 96 hr of admission to a cancer hospital to determine VO2peak and HR corresponding to low (40% VO2peak), moderate (60% VO2peak), and high (75% VO2peak) exercise intensities. Analyses of variance were used to compare estimated HR for each intensity level using the HRR and percent of 220-age methods with HR determined via VO2peak. RESULTS: HR corresponding to low-intensity exercise differed significantly across all three methods (p </= .05). No significant differences were observed between HR estimated via the percent of 220-age method and determined via VO2peak at moderate (100 +/- 8 and 113 +/- 24 bpm, p = .122) or high intensities (125 +/- 10 and 123 +/- 25 bpm, p = .994). CONCLUSION: In adults with AL, HR-based methods for defining aerobic exercise intensities should be used with caution. At low intensity, neither should be used, while at moderate and high intensities, the percent of 220-age equation might serve as an adequate substitute for CPET.",['(c) The Author(s) 2016.'],"['Story, Christina', 'Bryant, Ashley Leak', 'Phillips, Brett', 'Bailey, Charlotte', 'Shields, Edgar W', 'Battaglini, Claudio']","['Story C', 'Bryant AL', 'Phillips B', 'Bailey C', 'Shields EW', 'Battaglini C']","['Department of Exercise and Sport Science, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'School of Nursing, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Exercise and Sport Science, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Exercise and Sport Science, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA claudio@email.unc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160301,United States,Biol Res Nurs,Biological research for nursing,9815758,,IM,"['Acute Disease/*therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen Consumption/*physiology']",PMC5835965,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute leukemia', '*aerobic exercise intensity', '*chemotherapy', '*heart rate']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2016/03/03 06:00'],"['2016/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1099800416633836 [pii]', '10.1177/1099800416633836 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Res Nurs. 2016 Jul;18(4):432-8. doi: 10.1177/1099800416633836.

SUMMARY: Historically, conventional cancer chemotherapy agents were recommended for the management of progressive lymphomas requiring systemic treatment; in recent years, however, emerging targeted therapies have altered the landscape of lymphoma treatment. Idelalisib, a novel oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, disrupts downstream signaling pathways involved in cancer cell growth and survival. Inhibition of PI3K has been demonstrated to produce durable treatment responses and improved survival outcomes in clinical trials involving patients with indolent forms of NHL. Idelalisib is indicated for use in combination with rituximab for treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and as monotherapy for relapsed small lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma after the failure of at least two systemic treatments. The recommended dosage of idelalisib is 150 mg orally twice daily; the medication can be taken without regard to mealtimes. The most common adverse effects of idelalisib include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, cough, and pyrexia. Severe hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicities, including colitis and intestinal perforation, have also been reported in association with idelalisib use. Ongoing clinical studies are exploring the potential for expanded use of idelalisib in the management of other B-cell malignancies. CONCLUSION: Idelalisib is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or indolent NHL, providing a novel targeted therapeutic option for the management of these hematologic malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

Given the different prognoses and treatment strategies, a correct diagnosis is crucial. Molecular clonality assays assess rearranged lymphocyte antigen receptor gene diversity and can help differentiate reactive from neoplastic lymphoid proliferations. Molecular clonality assays are commonly used to assess atypical, mixed, or mature lymphoid proliferations; small tissue fragments that lack architecture; and fluid samples. In addition, clonality testing can be utilized to track neoplastic clones over time or across anatomic sites. Molecular clonality assays are not stand-alone tests but useful adjuncts that follow clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic assessment. Even though clonality testing provides valuable information in a variety of situations, the complexities and pitfalls of this method, as well as its dependency on the experience of the interpreter, are often understated. In addition, a lack of standardized terminology, laboratory practices, and interpretational guidelines hinders the reproducibility of clonality testing across laboratories in veterinary medicine. The objectives of this review are twofold. First, the review is intended to familiarize the diagnostic pathologist or interested clinician with the concepts, potential pitfalls, and limitations of clonality testing. Second, the review strives to provide a basis for future harmonization of clonality testing in veterinary medicine by providing diagnostic guidelines.",['(c) The Author(s) 2016.'],"['Keller, S M', 'Vernau, W', 'Moore, P F']","['Keller SM', 'Vernau W', 'Moore PF']","['Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA pfmoore@ucdavis.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160301,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,,IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*veterinary', '*Veterinary Medicine']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*PCR', '*genomic DNA', '*leukemia', '*lymphocyte antigen receptor gene rearrangement', '*lymphoma', '*molecular clonality testing', '*veterinary medicine']",2016/03/05 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/03/03 06:00'],"['2016/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0300985815626576 [pii]', '10.1177/0300985815626576 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2016 Jul;53(4):711-25. doi: 10.1177/0300985815626576.

Emergence of FPCL seems unrelated to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) serological positivity or to skin inflammation. A total of 17 cutaneous lymphomas with a history of vaccine injection at the site of tumor development were selected from 47 FPCLs. Clinical presentation, histology, immunophenotype, FeLV p27 and gp70 expression, and clonality were assessed. A majority of male (12/17), domestic short-haired (13/17) cats with a mean age of 11.3 years was reported. Postinjection time of development ranged from 15 days to approximately 9 years in 5 cats. At diagnosis, 11 of 17 cats had no evidence of internal disease. Lymphomas developed in interscapular (8/17), thoracic (8/17), and flank (1/17) cutaneous regions; lacked epitheliotropism; and were characterized by necrosis (16/17), angiocentricity (13/17), angioinvasion (9/17), angiodestruction (8/17), and peripheral inflammation composed of lymphoid aggregates (14/17). FeLV gp70 and/or p27 proteins were expressed in 10 of 17 tumors. By means of World Health Organization classification, immunophenotype, and clonality, the lesions were categorized as large B-cell lymphoma (11/17), anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (3/17), natural killer cell-like (1/17) lymphoma, or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (1/17). Lineage remained uncertain in 1 case. Cutaneous lymphomas at injection sites (CLIS) shared some clinical and pathological features with feline injection site sarcomas and with lymphomas developing in the setting of subacute to chronic inflammation reported in human beings. Persistent inflammation induced by the injection and by reactivation of FeLV expression may have contributed to emergence of CLIS.",['(c) The Author(s) 2016.'],"['Roccabianca, P', 'Avallone, G', 'Rodriguez, A', 'Crippa, L', 'Lepri, E', 'Giudice, C', 'Caniatti, M', 'Moore, P F', 'Affolter, V K']","['Roccabianca P', 'Avallone G', 'Rodriguez A', 'Crippa L', 'Lepri E', 'Giudice C', 'Caniatti M', 'Moore PF', 'Affolter VK']","['DIVET: Dipartimento di Scienze Veterinarie e Sanita Pubblica, University of Milano, Italy paola.roccabianca@unimi.it.', 'DIMEVET: Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Veterinarie, University of Bologna, Italy.', 'Private practitioner, Milano, Italy.', 'ISTOVET, via W.

However, its role in heart development is not understood. Here, we demonstrate a requirement for KMT2D in cardiac precursors and cardiomyocytes during cardiogenesis in mice. Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of ion transport and cell cycle genes, leading to altered calcium handling and cell cycle defects. We further determined that myocardial Kmt2d deletion led to decreased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 at enhancers and promoters. Finally, we identified KMT2D-bound regions in cardiomyocytes, of which a subset was associated with decreased gene expression and decreased H3K4me2 in mutant hearts.

Hyper-phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (hyper-pRb) is found in high levels in ALL cells. Nevertheless, the ALL lymphocyte proliferation rate for the average patient is surprisingly low compared to its normal counterpart of the same maturation level. Additionally, as stated in literature, ALL cells possibly reside at or beyond the RP which is located in the late-G1 phase. This state may favor their differentiation resistant phenotype. A major phenomenon contributing to this fact is thought to be the observed limited redundancy in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) by the various Cyclin Dependent Kinases (Cdks). The latter may result in partial loss of pRb functions despite hyper-phosphorylation. RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, an in silico model aiming at simulating the biochemical regulation of the RP in ALL is introduced. By exploiting experimental findings derived from leukemic cells and following a semi-quantitative calibration procedure, the model has been shown to satisfactorily reproduce such a behavior for the RP pathway. At the same time, the calibrated model has been proved to be in agreement with the observed variation in the ALL cell cycle duration. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model aims to contribute to a better understanding of the complex phenomena governing the leukemic cell cycle. At the same time it constitutes a significant first step in the creation of a personalized proliferation rate predictor that can be used in the context of multiscale cancer modeling. Such an approach is expected to play an important role in the refinement and the advancement of mechanistic modeling of ALL in the context of the emergent and promising scientific domains of In Silico Oncology and more generally In Silico Medicine.",,"['Ouzounoglou, Eleftherios', 'Dionysiou, Dimitra', 'Stamatakos, Georgios S']","['Ouzounoglou E', 'Dionysiou D', 'Stamatakos GS']","['In Silico Oncology and In Silico Medicine Group, Laboratory of Microwaves and Fiber Optics, Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, 9 Iroon Polytechniou, Zografou, 15780, Athens, Greece. elouzou@central.ntua.gr.', 'In Silico Oncology and In Silico Medicine Group, Laboratory of Microwaves and Fiber Optics, Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, 9 Iroon Polytechniou, Zografou, 15780, Athens, Greece. dimdio@esd.ece.ntua.gr.', 'In Silico Oncology and In Silico Medicine Group, Laboratory of Microwaves and Fiber Optics, Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, 9 Iroon Polytechniou, Zografou, 15780, Athens, Greece. gestam@central.ntua.gr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160301,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', '*G1 Phase', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', '*S Phase']",PMC4774111,,,2016/03/05 06:00,2017/02/23 06:00,['2016/03/03 06:00'],"['2015/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12918-016-0264-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12918-016-0264-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2016 Mar 1;10:23. doi: 10.1186/s12918-016-0264-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a multicentre, prospective cohort study that included children aged </=18 years with de novo AML. DNA was isolated from blood lymphocytes or buccal swabs, and candidate gene SNP analysis was conducted. Primary outcome was the occurrence of microbiologically documented sterile site infection during chemotherapy. Secondary outcomes were Gram-positive and -negative infections, viridans group streptococcal infection and proven/probable invasive fungal infection. Interpretation was guided by consistency in risk alleles and microbiologic agent with previous literature. Over the study period 254 children and adolescents with AML were enrolled. Overall, 190 (74.8%) had at least one sterile site microbiologically documented infection. Among the 172 with inferred European ancestry and DNA available, nine significant associations were observed; two were consistent with previous literature. Allele A at IL1B (rs16944) was associated with decreased microbiologically documented infection, and allele G at IL10 (rs1800896) was associated with increased risk of Gram-positive infection. We identified SNPs associated with infection risk in paediatric AML.

Inhibition of CXC chemokine receptor 4 significantly ameliorates T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in murine models of the disease; however, signaling by CXC chemokine receptor 4 is important in limiting the divagation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells out of the perivascular space into the central nervous system parenchyma. Therefore, Inhibition of CXC chemokine receptor 4 potentially may untangle T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells from retention outside the brain. Here, we show that leukemic lymphoblasts massively infiltrate cranial bone marrow, with diffusion to the meninges without invasion of the brain parenchyma, in mice that underwent xenotransplantation with human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells or that developed leukemia from transformed hematopoietic progenitors. We tested the hypothesis that T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia neuropathology results from meningeal infiltration through CXC chemokine receptor 4-mediated bone marrow colonization. Inhibition of leukemia engraftment in the bone marrow by pharmacologic CXC chemokine receptor 4 antagonism significantly ameliorated neuropathologic aspects of the disease. Genetic deletion of CXCR4 in murine hematopoietic progenitors abrogated leukemogenesis induced by constitutively active Notch1, whereas lack of CCR6 and CCR7, which have been shown to be involved in T cell and leukemia extravasation into the central nervous system, respectively, did not influence T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia development. We hypothesize that lymphoblastic meningeal infiltration as a result of bone marrow colonization is responsible for the degenerative alterations of the neuroparenchyma as well as the alteration of cerebrospinal fluid drainage in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts.

METHODS: We randomly divided 36 C57 male mice into a control and a heat stress treatment group and submerged the lower part of the torso in water at 25 degrees C and 43 degrees C, respectively, both for 15 minutes. At 1, 7, and 14 days after treatment, we obtained the testicular organ indexes, observed the changes in testicular morphology by HE staining, and determined the location and expression levels of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) and synaptonemal comlex protein-3 (SCP-3) in the testis tissue by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: The testicular organ index was significantly lower in the heat stress treatment than in the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the controls, the heat shock-treated mice showed loosely arranged spermatogenic cells scattered in the seminiferous tubules at 1 day after heat stress treatment, atrophied, loosely arranged and obviously reduced number of spermatogenic cells at 7 days, and relatively closely arranged seminiferous tubules and increased number and layers of spermatogenic cells at 14 days. The number of SCP-3 labelled spermatocytes obviously decreased in the heat stress-treated animals at 1 and 7 days and began to increase at 14 days. The PLZF protein expression was significantly reduced in the heat stress treatment group at 1 day as compared with that in the control (0.19 +/- 0.12 vs 0.64 +/- 0.03, P < 0.01), but elevated to 0.77 +/- 0.02 at 7 and 14 days, even remarkably higher than in the control animals (P < 0.01).

Furthermore, genetic mouse models of tetraspanins highlight their contribution to tumorigenesis.

The second haplotype of all three offspring contained KIR 2DL4, -2DL5, -2DS1, -2DS4 (del 22bp variant), -2DS5, -3DL1 and -3DL2 genes, which was the basis of the assumption that there is a hybrid haplotype and that the present 3DL1 gene is a variant of the 3DS1 gene. Due to consanguinity among the ancestors, the results of KIR segregation analysis showed the existence of a very rare KIR genotype in the offspring. The family who is the subject of this case is even more interesting because the father was 10/10 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched to his daughter, all members of the family have the ""best"" donor KIR-B content and the presence of a rare KIR genotype with KIR 2DP1-2DL1 genes absence.",,"['Vojvodic, S', 'Ademovic-Sazdanic, D']","['Vojvodic S', 'Ademovic-Sazdanic D']","['Tissue Typing Compartment, Institute for Blood Transfusion of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, Serbia.', 'Tissue Typing Compartment, Institute for Blood Transfusion of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, Serbia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151230,Poland,Balkan J Med Genet,Balkan journal of medical genetics : BJMG,9806959,,,,PMC4768826,['NOTNLM'],"['Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobin-like receptor (KIR)', 'polymorphism', 'natural killer (NK) cells']",2016/03/02 06:00,2016/03/02 06:01,['2016/03/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/bjmg-2015-0006 [doi]', 'bjmg-18-01-55 [pii]']",epublish,Balkan J Med Genet. 2015 Dec 30;18(1):55-64. doi: 10.1515/bjmg-2015-0006. eCollection 2015 Jun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systematical studies concerning the clinical implications and genetic correlations of HOXA9 aberrations in patients with AML are relatively promising. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we investigated mutational status and the mRNA levels of the HOXA9 gene in 258 patients with AML. Furthermore, hematological characteristics, chromosome abnormalities, and genetic mutations associated with AML were analyzed, followed by the assessment of clinical survival. Besides, the expression level and mutational status of MEIS1, a cofactor of HOXA9, were also detected in patients with AML with the aim of a deeper understanding about the homeodomain-containing transcription factors associated with hematological characteristics. RESULTS: HOXA9 and MEIS1 mutations were detected in 4.26% and 3.49% AML cases, respectively. No correlations were detected between mutation status and clinical characteristics, cytogenetic and genetic aberrations, and clinical survival. Higher HOXA9 expression levels were correlated with white blood cell count and closely associated with unfavorable karyotype as well as MLL-PTD and EZH2 mutations, whereas, there was an inverse correlation with the French-American-British M3 subtype. Compared with patients with lower HOXA9 expression levels, those with higher HOXA9 expression levels had a lower complete remission rate and inferior survivals in both AML and cytogenetically normal AML. CONCLUSION: HOXA9 expression may serve as a promising biomarker to ameliorate a prognostic model for predicting clinical outcome and consummating individualized treatment in patients with AML.",,"['Gao, Li', 'Sun, Junzhong', 'Liu, Fang', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Ma, Yigai']","['Gao L', 'Sun J', 'Liu F', 'Zhang H', 'Ma Y']","[""Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China; Department of Oncology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160209,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC4755436,['NOTNLM'],"['HOXA9', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical survival', 'expression']",2016/03/02 06:00,2016/03/02 06:01,['2016/03/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S95279 [doi]', 'ott-9-711 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Feb 9;9:711-22. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S95279. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For most subtypes of AML, the backbone of treatment was introduced nearly 40 years ago as a combination of cytosine arabinoside with an anthracycline. This therapy is still the worldwide standard of care. Two-thirds of patients achieve complete remission, although most of them ultimately relapse. Since the FLT3 mutation is the most frequent, it serves as a key molecular target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that inhibit FLT3 kinase. In this study, we report the conjugation of TKIs onto spherical gold nanoparticles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The internalization of TKI-nanocarriers was proved by the strongly scattered light from gold nanoparticles and was correlated with the results obtained by transmission electron microscopy and dark-field microscopy. The therapeutic effect of the newly designed drugs was investigated by several methods including cell counting assay as well as the MTT assay. RESULTS: We report the newly described bioconjugates to be superior when compared with the drug alone, with data confirmed by state-of-the-art analyses of internalization, cell biology, gene analysis for FLT3-IDT gene, and Western blotting to assess degradation of the FLT3 protein.

Bergia odorata Edgew) (Elatinaceae family) is used traditionally to repair bones and is applied as a poultice on sores. It is also used for stomach troubles and as an antidote to scorpion stings. So far, very little scientific work has been reported to validate its ethnomedical uses in the alleviation of pain, bone repair, etc. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to explore the anti-inflammatory and anti-implantation potential of n-hexane extract of B. suffruticosa whole plant in mice along with identification of its chemical constituents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: n-Hexane extract of B. suffruticosa whole plant was screened for acute and chronic anti-inflammatory activity followed by an anti-estrogenic activity. Eventually, n-hexane extract was tested for anti-implantation activity by exploiting markers of uterine receptivity, lipid peroxidation, and superoxide enzyme activity. The extract was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight in each study. RESULTS: Thin layer chromatography fingerprint profile of n-hexane extract revealed the presence of lupeol and beta-sitosterol. The n-hexane extract reduced the edema by 80% in acute inflammation, whereas it reduced edema to 75% on the 5(th) day in chronic inflammation. The n-hexane extract reduced elevated malonaldehyde level from 6 to 2.5 nmol/g x 10(-5) and increased superoxide dismutase enzyme activity from 0 to 350 units/g in treated animals on the 5(th) day of pregnancy. Moreover, extract decreased uterine weight from 0.33 to 0.2 g in estradiol treated animals. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that n-hexane extract of B. suffruticosa is having potent anti-inflammatory, anti-estrogenic, and anti-implantation activity. This is the first report of all the pharmacological activities of B. suffruticosa mentioned above. SUMMARY: TLC fingerprint profile of n-hexane extract of Bergia suffruticosa whole plant revealed the presence of lupeol and beta-sitosteroln-Hexane extract showed in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in both acute and chronic model of inflammation in ratsn-Hexane extract possess significant anti-estrogenic activityn-Hexane extract altered the levels superoxide anion radical and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity during the blastocyst implantationAnti-implantation activity of n-hexane extract is attributed to its anti-inflammatory and anti-estrogenic potential.

A typical host has between 10(4) and 10(5) clones of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes, each clone distinguished by the genomic integration site of the single-copy HTLV-1 provirus. The HTLV-1 bZIP (HBZ) factor gene is constitutively expressed from the minus strand of the provirus, whereas plus-strand expression, required for viral propagation to uninfected cells, is suppressed or intermittent in vivo, allowing escape from host immune surveillance. It remains unknown what regulates this pattern of proviral transcription and latency. Here, we show that CTCF, a key regulator of chromatin structure and function, binds to the provirus at a sharp border in epigenetic modifications in the pX region of the HTLV-1 provirus in T cells naturally infected with HTLV-1. CTCF is a zinc-finger protein that binds to an insulator region in genomic DNA and plays a fundamental role in controlling higher order chromatin structure and gene expression in vertebrate cells. We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin. CTCF-binding sites (CTCF-BSs) have been propagated throughout the genome by transposons in certain primate lineages, but CTCF binding has not previously been described in present-day exogenous retroviruses.

This manuscript proposes mathematical model equations representing the disease dynamics of B-cell CLL. We interconnect delay differential cell cycle models in each of the tumor-involved disease centers using physiologically relevant cell migration. We further introduce five hypothetical case studies representing CLL heterogeneity commonly seen in clinical practice and demonstrate how the proposed CLL model framework may capture disease pathophysiology across patient types. We conclude by exploring the capacity of the proposed temporally- and spatially distributed model to capture the heterogeneity of CLL disease progression. By using global sensitivity analysis, the critical parameters influencing disease trajectory over space and time are: 1) the initial number of CLL cells in peripheral blood, the number of involved lymph nodes, the presence and degree of splenomegaly; 2) the migratory fraction of nonproliferating as well as proliferating CLL cells from bone marrow into blood and of proliferating CLL cells from blood into lymph nodes; and 3) the parameters inducing nonproliferative cells to proliferate.

Instead patients are enrolled in intensive induction therapies with substantial side effects. In modern protocols, therapy response is monitored by minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis and used for postinduction risk group stratification. DNA methylation profiling is a candidate for subtype discrimination at diagnosis and we investigated its role as a prognostic marker in pediatric T-ALL. PROCEDURE: Sixty-five diagnostic T-ALL samples from Nordic pediatric patients treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL 2008 (NOPHO ALL 2008) protocol were analyzed by HumMeth450K genome wide DNA methylation arrays. Methylation status was analyzed in relation to clinical data and early T-cell precursor (ETP) phenotype. RESULTS: Two distinct CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) groups were identified. Patients with a CIMP-negative profile had an inferior response to treatment compared to CIMP-positive patients (3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR3y ) rate: 29% vs. 6%, P = 0.01). Most importantly, CIMP classification at diagnosis allowed subgrouping of high-risk T-ALL patients (MRD >/=0.1% at day 29) into two groups with significant differences in outcome (CIR3y rates: CIMP negative 50% vs. CIMP positive 12%; P = 0.02). These groups did not differ regarding ETP phenotype, but the CIMP-negative group was younger (P = 0.02) and had higher white blood cell count at diagnosis (P = 0.004) compared with the CIMP-positive group. CONCLUSIONS: CIMP classification at diagnosis in combination with MRD during induction therapy is a strong candidate for further risk classification and could confer important information in treatment decision making.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Borssen, Magnus', 'Haider, Zahra', 'Landfors, Mattias', 'Noren-Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Asberg, Ann E', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Madsen, Hans O', 'Marquart, Hanne', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Hultdin, Magnus', 'Roos, Goran', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Degerman, Sofie']","['Borssen M', 'Haider Z', 'Landfors M', 'Noren-Nystrom U', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Asberg AE', 'Kanerva J', 'Madsen HO', 'Marquart H', 'Heyman M', 'Hultdin M', 'Roos G', 'Forestier E', 'Degerman S']","['Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Pediatrics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Trondheim, Norway.', 'Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Woman and Child health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160229,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*MRD', '*T-ALL', '*WBC', '*childhood leukemia', '*prognosis']",2016/03/02 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/03/02 06:00'],"['2015/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25958 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jul;63(7):1185-92. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25958.

Here, by serial transplantation in NOG mice, we established two highly tumorigenic adult T-cell leukemia-derived cell lines, ST1-N6 and TL-Om1-N8. When transplanted s.c., these cells formed tumors significantly earlier and from fewer initial cells than their parental lines ST1 and TL-Om1. We found that protein kinase B (AKT) signaling was upregulated in ST1-N6 and TL-Om1-N8 cells, and that this upregulation was due to the decreased expression of a negative regulator, INPP5D. Furthermore, the introduction of a constitutively active AKT mutant expression vector into ST1 cells augmented the tumorigenicity of the cells, whereas treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 attenuated the progression of tumors induced by ST1-N6 cells. Collectively, our results reveal that the AKT signaling pathway plays a critical role in the malignancy of adult T-cell leukemia-derived cells.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Its clinical significance in the setting of normal bone marrow morphology is unclear. We described the clinical characteristics, cytogenetic findings, and outcome of 102 such patients seen at our institution from 2000-2014. Their median age was 66 years. The indication for bone marrow biopsy was either unexplained cytopenias (48%) or hematologic cancer staging/reevaluation (52%). In 88 (86%) patients, 20q- was an isolated finding. Thirty-nine (38%) patients previously received chemotherapy and 88 (86%) had cytopenias at the time of 20q- finding. After a median of 35 months, 12 (13%) patients developed MNs: 10 myelodysplastic syndromes, one acute myeloid leukemia and one myeloproliferative neoplasm. None of 14 patients with normal blood counts, but 7 of 35 (20%) with mild cytopenias, and 5 of 53 (9%) with moderate/severe cytopenias developed MNs.

However, asparaginase-related complications, including the development of hypersensitivity reactions, can limit its use in individual patients. Of considerable concern in the setting of clinical allergy is the development of neutralizing antibodies and associated asparaginase inactivity. Also problematic in the use of asparaginase is the potential for the development of silent inactivation, with the formation of neutralizing antibodies and reduced asparaginase activity in the absence of a clinically evident allergic reaction. Here we present guidelines for the identification and management of clinical hypersensitivity and silent inactivation with Escherichia coli- and Erwinia chrysanthemi- derived asparaginase preparations. These guidelines were developed by a consensus panel of experts following a review of the available published data. We provide a consensus of expert opinions on the role of serum asparaginase level assessment, indications for switching asparaginase preparation, and monitoring after change in asparaginase preparation.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['van der Sluis, Inge M', 'Vrooman, Lynda M', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Goulden, Nicholas', 'Mondelaers, Veerle', 'Sanchez de Toledo, Jose', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Whitlock, James A']","['van der Sluis IM', 'Vrooman LM', 'Pieters R', 'Baruchel A', 'Escherich G', 'Goulden N', 'Mondelaers V', 'Sanchez de Toledo J', 'Rizzari C', 'Silverman LB', 'Whitlock JA']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands i.vandersluis@erasmusmc.nl lynda_vrooman@dfci.harvard.edu."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, MA, USA i.vandersluis@erasmusmc.nl lynda_vrooman@dfci.harvard.edu."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris and University Paris Diderot, France.', 'University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Clinic of Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Belgium.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca, Hospital S.

The majority of these genetic events are small, site-specific alterations in DNA sequence. In more than two thirds of patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia mutations epigenetic modifiers are detected. Epigenetic modifiers encompass a large group of proteins that modify DNA at cytosine residues or cause post-translational histone modifications such as methylations or acetylations. Altered functions of these epigenetic modifiers disturb the physiological balance between gene activation and gene repression and contribute to aberrant gene expression regulation found in acute myeloid leukemia.

Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the only accepted therapy with curative potential. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Herein, we report our multicenter, retrospective experience with 46 (23 female; 23 male) Ph(+) ALL patients, who were treated off-study between 2005 and 2012. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 46 years (range, 19-73 years). During induction, 30 (65%), 13 (28%), and 3 (7%) patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) concurrent with chemotherapy (TKIs/chemotherapy), chemotherapy only, and TKIs only, respectively. Following induction, rates of complete remission (CR) of the study population were 85% (n = 39). CR rate in patients receiving TKIs during induction (n = 33) was significantly higher compared with patients who received chemotherapy only (n = 13; P = .011). Taking TKIs during induction significantly reduced induction mortality (3.3% vs. 38%; P = .01). Allo-HCT was performed subsequently in 21 (46%) patients. More patients who received TKIs with or without chemotherapy (19/33; 58%) during induction were able to undergo to allo-HCT compared with patients who received chemotherapy only (2/13; 15%; P = .005). Median overall survival of patients who were treated with TKIs during induction and received allo-HCT (not reached; NR) was significantly prolonged compared with patients who received allo-HCT but without TKIs during induction (23.2 months) and to the rest of the cohort (21.2 months; P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Current state-of-the art management of Ph(+) ALL in real-life seems to be incorporation of TKIs to chemotherapy regimens and proceeding to allo-HCT, whenever possible.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In murine models, forced expression of MN1 in hematopoietic progenitors induces an aggressive myeloid leukemia that is strictly dependent on a defined gene expression program in the cell of origin, which includes the homeobox genes Hoxa9 and Meis1 as key components. Here, we have shown that this program is controlled by two histone methyltransferases, MLL1 and DOT1L, as deletion of either Mll1 or Dot1l in MN1-expressing cells abrogated the cell of origin-derived gene expression program, including the expression of Hoxa cluster genes. In murine models, genetic inactivation of either Mll1 or Dot1l impaired MN1-mediated leukemogenesis. We determined that HOXA9 and MEIS1 are coexpressed with MN1 in a subset of clinical MN1hi leukemia, and human MN1hi/HOXA9hi leukemias were sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of DOT1L. Together, these data point to DOT1L as a potential therapeutic target in MN1hi AML.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Transplantation outcomes from HIDs or MSDs were compared in a disease-specific, biologically phase III randomized, multicenter study. Between July 2010 and December 2013, 210 patients with Philadelphia-negative high-risk ALL in CR1 were assigned to undergo unmanipulated HIDs (121 patients) or MSDs HSCT (89 patients) according to donor availability on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. RESULTS: Overall, 24 of the 210 patients had lost transplant eligibility. Therefore, 186 of 210 (88%) patients were finally transplanted from MSD (n = 83) or HID (n = 103). Based on the ITT principle, the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) did not differ between HID and MSD groups [61%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 52%-70%; vs. 60%, CI, 49%-71%; P = 0.91] from CR, neither did DFS differ between the two groups (68%, CI, 58%-78%; vs. 64%, CI, 52%-76%; P = 0.56) from time of the graft, with cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality of 13% (CI, 7%-19%) and 11% (CI, 4%-18%; P = 0.84) and relapse rates of 18% (CI, 10%-26%) and 24% (CI, 14%-34%; P = 0.30), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Haploidentical HSCT achieves outcomes similar to those of MSD-HSCT for Philadelphia-negative high-risk ALL patients in CR1. Such transplantation could be a valid alternative as post-remission treatment for high-risk ALL patients in CR1 lacking an identical donor. Clin Cancer Res; 22(14); 3467-76.

METHODS: The design was observational from reviewing the medical records of patients seen in outpatient and inpatient settings. It included >/=50 subjects who demanded attention during the period 2008-2012 and that met specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. The main measures were: comorbidity (population group), clinical stage, patient treatment, response to treatment, overall survival, progression-free survival, and mortality. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: p<0.05. RESULTS: 270 patients (CLL=90, DLBCL=81, FL=99) were recruited, with a mean age of 72.5, 65.5, and 62.4 years, respectively. These groups of neoplasms, compared with the general population, showed a higher percentage of men (60.0, 56.8 and 52.6 vs. 46.2%) and morbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index: 1.6, 1.5, 1.4 vs. 0.4, respectively; p<0.05). The administration of chemotherapy treatment was 28.9 vs. 86.4 and 90.9%, respectively (p<0.001).

The most important and well-known function of Rex is stabilizing and exporting viral mRNAs from the nucleus, particularly for unspliced/partially-spliced mRNAs encoding the structural proteins essential for viral replication. Without Rex, these unspliced viral mRNAs would otherwise be completely spliced. Therefore, Rex is vital for the translation of structural proteins and the stabilization of viral genomic RNA and, thus, for viral replication. Rex schedules the period of extensive viral replication and suppression to enter latency. Although the importance of Rex in the viral life-cycle is well understood, the underlying molecular mechanism of how Rex achieves its function has not been clarified. For example, how does Rex protect unspliced/partially-spliced viral mRNAs from the host cellular splicing machinery? How does Rex protect viral mRNAs, antigenic to eukaryotic cells, from cellular mRNA surveillance mechanisms? Here we will discuss these mechanisms, which explain the function of Rex as an organizer of HTLV-1 expression based on previously and recently discovered aspects of Rex.

Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9761 was a prospectively designed study aimed at determining the prognostic significance of OM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 502 patients with suspected clinical stage I (T1-2N0M0) NSCLC were prospectively enrolled at 11 institutions. Primary tumor and lymph nodes (LNs) were collected and sent to a central site for molecular analysis. Both were assayed for OM using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for carcinoembryonic antigen. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-nine of the 502 enrolled patients underwent complete surgical staging. Three hundred four patients (61%) had pathologic stage I NSCLC (T1, 58%; T2, 42%) and were included in the final analysis. Fifty-six percent had adenocarcinomas, 34% had squamous cell carcinomas, and 10% had another histology. LNs from 298 patients were analyzed by IHC; 41 (14%) were IHC-positive (42% in N1 position, 58% in N2 position). Neither overall survival (OS) nor disease-free survival was associated with IHC positivity; however, patients who had IHC-positive N2 LNs had statistically significantly worse survival rates (hazard ratio, 2.04, P = .017). LNs from 256 patients were analyzed by RT-PCR; 176 (69%) were PCR-positive (52% in N1 position, 48% in N2 position). Neither OS nor disease-free survival was associated with PCR positivity. CONCLUSION: NSCLC tumor markers can be detected in histologically negative LNs by AE1/AE3 IHC and carcinoembryonic antigen RT-PCR. In this prospective, multi-institutional trial, the presence of OM by IHC staining in N2 LNs of patients with NSCLC correlated with decreased OS.

This study presents an analysis of hemorrhagic cystitis severity and treatment outcomes in a large pediatric population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with hemorrhagic cystitis treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital(R) were identified from 1990 to 2010. Demographic data were gathered along with information pertaining to initial primary diagnosis, hemorrhagic cystitis diagnosis and treatment, and mortality. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate associations between risk factors and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis as well as treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 285 patients who met inclusion criteria 54% were male. Mean age was 11.41 years. Mean time from initial primary diagnosis to hemorrhagic cystitis onset was 29 months. Noninvasive treatment was performed in 246 patients (86%) and operative intervention was required in 14 (4.9%). Bivariate analysis demonstrated that pelvic radiation therapy (p = 0.0002), any radiation therapy (p = 0.005), acute lymphocytic leukemia (p = 0.01), bone marrow transplantation (p = 0.0225), cyclophosphamide exposure (p = 0.0419) and BK virus positivity (p = 0.0472) were predictors of higher grade hemorrhagic cystitis. Factors correlating with the need for invasive management on bivariate analysis included pelvic radiation therapy (p = 0.0266), bone marrow transplantation (p = 0.0007), hematological malignancy (p = 0.0066), ifosfamide exposure (p = 0.0441) and male gender (p = 0.0383). Multivariate analysis showed independent effects of pelvic radiation therapy (p = 0.001) and delayed onset of hemorrhagic cystitis (p = 0.0444). CONCLUSIONS: Severity of hemorrhagic cystitis and failure of noninvasive management correlate with several identifiable risk factors. Prospective identification of patients with these risk factors may allow for targeted early intervention in those at highest risk.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: From September 2006 to December 2013, a total of 110 consecutive patients with ALL had received UCBT, including 79 male and 31 female patients with a median age of 14(2-51) years, a median weight of 45(12-100)kg. Sixty-one cases were in the first complete remission (CR), 30, 6 and 13 patients in the second, the third CR and advanced stages respectively. The conditioning regimen consisted of total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide and cytarabine (TBI/Cy/Ara-C) in 61 patients, busulfan, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (BU/Cy/Flu) in 39 patients and BU/Cy/Ara-C in 10 patients. All patients received a combination of cyclosporine (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: The median amount of total nuclear cells(TNC) and CD34(+) cells were 3.90(1.97-13.50)x10(7)/kg and 2.07(0.40-5.56)x10(5)/kg. The cumulative incidence of sustained donor engraftment was 94.5% (95% CI 94.5%-94.6%) at a median of 18 days after transplantation (range, 12-37 days). The cumulative incidence of platelet recovery at 180 days after transplantation was 82.1% (95% CI 81.8%-82.4%) with a median time to recovery of 40 (range, 15-153) days. Incidences of grade ~ and ~ acute GVHD were 21.8% and 10.9% respectively. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 17.9%. During a median follow up period of 26 (range 6-94) months, the disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 3 years were 54.5% and 58.8%, respectively. The transplantation-related mortality (TRM) at 180 days after transplantation was 22.7%. The cumulative incidence of 3-year relapse rate was 18.3% (95% CI 17.9%-18.6%).

In a previous research, we reported that cryptotanshinone (CPT) exerted cytotoxic effects toward acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells through mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. PURPOSE: In the present study, we further investigated the role of UPR in CPT-induced cytotoxicity on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells by applying tools of pharmacogenomics and bioinformatics. METHODS: Gene expression profiling was performed by mRNA microarray hybridization. Potential transcription factor binding motifs were identified in the promoter regions of the deregulated genes by Cistrome software. Molecular docking on eIF-4A and PI3K was performed to investigate the inhibitory activity of CPT on translation initiation. RESULTS: CPT regulated genes related to UPR and eIF2 signaling pathways. The DNA-Damage-Inducible Transcript 3 (DDIT3) gene, which is activated as consequence of UPR malfunction during apoptosis, was induced and validated by in vitro experiments. Transcription factor binding motif analysis of the microarrary-retrieved deregulated genes in the promoter region emphasized the relevance of transcription factors, such as ATF2, ATF4 and XBP1, regulating UPR and cell apoptosis. Molecular docking suggested inhibitory effects of CPT by binding to eIF-4A and PI3K providing evidence for a role of CPT's in the disruption of protein synthesis. CONCLUSION: CPT triggered UPR and inhibited protein synthesis via eIF-mediated translation initiation, potentially supporting CPT-induced cytotoxic effects toward acute leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Massage therapy, as a nondrug approach, can be useful in controlling such problems. However, very few studies have been conducted on the effects of massage therapy on the complications of leukemia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of slow-stroke back massage (SSBM) on the symptom cluster in acute leukemia adult patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 60 patients with acute leukemia were allocated randomly to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received SSBM 3 times a week (every other day for 10 minutes) for 4 weeks. The pain, fatigue, and sleep disorder intensities were measured using the numeric rating scale. The sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Statistical tests of chi, t test, and the repeated-measure analysis of variance were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Results showed that the SSBM intervention significantly reduced the progressive sleep disorder, pain, fatigue, and improved sleep quality over time. CONCLUSIONS: Slow-stroke back massage, as a simple, noninvasive, and cost-effective approach, along with routine nursing care, can be used to improve the symptom cluster of pain, fatigue, and sleep disorders in leukemia patients.

We obtained data for the period 2008-2012 from the Death Registry System maintained by the Inner Mongolia Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We computed the percentages of leukemia-related deaths and controls diagnosed by various methods and at different levels of hospitals. The chi(2) test was used to examine differences in leukemia-related mortality according to sex. We also calculated potential years of life lost (PYLL) and average years of life lost. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to analyze the effect of sociodemographic characteristics. The sex-adjusted leukemia-related mortality rate was 3.74/100 000. The mortality rate in men (4.27/100 000) was significantly higher than that in women (3.17/100 000), as was the respective PYLL (8040.5 vs. 6000.5 person-years). Mortality increased with increasing age in both men and women. The highest mortality rate was observed in those over 70 years of age for both men (18.36/100 000) and women (7.68/100 000). Men with a higher education level showed an increased risk of leukemia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-2.07, P = 0.04).

To test the hypothesis that many treatment-related morbidities are identifiable in the early posttherapy period, we determined the rates and causes for hospitalization among survivors of leukemia and lymphoma during the first 3 years posttherapy. Using a health plan claims database, we identified patients aged 0 to 21 years old treated for leukemia or lymphoma from 2000 to 2010. Survivors were matched 10:1 with similar children without a history of cancer. Hospitalization rates over 3 years were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression and risks of cause-specific hospitalization were compared using log-binomial models. Nineteen percent of childhood leukemia and lymphoma survivors were hospitalized in the first 3 years off therapy. Leukemia survivors (N=529) experienced over 6 times (hazard ratio=6.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9-8.0) and lymphoma survivors (N=454) over 3 times the hospitalization rate of controls (hazard ratio=3.2; 95% CI, 2.5-4.2). Compared with children without a cancer history, survivors were at increased risk for hospitalization due to infectious causes (leukemia: relative risk [RR], 60.0; 95% CI, 23.4-154.0; lymphoma: RR, 10.0; 95% CI, 4.4-22.9).

Specific chromosomal translocations within leukemic blasts are important prognostic factors that allow identification of relevant subgroups. In this study, we developed a multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection of the 4 most frequent translocations in ALL (BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, and E2A- PBX1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 214 diagnosed ALL samples from both adult and pediatric ALL and 14 cases of CML patients (154 bone marrow and 74 peripheral blood samples) were assessed for specific chromosomal translocations by cytogenetic and multiplex RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: The results showed that 46 cases of ALL and CML (20.2%) contained the fusion transcripts. Within the positive ALL patients, the most prevalent cryptic translocation observed was mBCR-ABL (p190) at 8.41%. In addition, other genetic rearrangements detected by the multiplex PCR were 4.21% TEL-AML1 and 2.34% E2A-PBX1, whereas MLL-AF4 exhibited negative results in all tested samples. Moreover, MBCR-ABL was detected in all 14 CML samples. In 16 samples of normal karyotype ALL (n=9), ALL with no cytogentic result (n=4) and CML with no Philadelphia chromosome (n=3), fusion transcripts were detected.

An attractive strategy is to identify and subsequently target the survival signals in p53 defective cancer cells. Here we uncover a RUNX2-mediated survival signal in p53 defective cancer cells. The inhibition of this signal induces apoptosis in cancer cells but not non-transformed cells. Using the CRISPR technology, we demonstrate that p53 loss enhances the apoptosis caused by RUNX2 knockdown. Mechanistically, RUNX2 provides the survival signal partially through inducing MYC transcription. Cancer cells have high levels of activating histone marks on the MYC locus and concomitant high MYC expression. RUNX2 knockdown decreases the levels of these histone modifications and the recruitment of the Menin/MLL1 (mixed lineage leukemia 1) complex to the MYC locus. Two inhibitors of the Menin/MLL1 complex induce apoptosis in p53 defective cancer cells. Together, we identify a RUNX2-mediated epigenetic mechanism of the survival of p53 defective cancer cells and provide a proof-of-principle that the inhibition of this epigenetic axis is a promising strategy to kill p53 defective cancer cells.",,"['Shin, Min Hwa', 'He, Yunlong', 'Marrogi, Eryney', 'Piperdi, Sajida', 'Ren, Ling', 'Khanna, Chand', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Liu, Chengyu', 'Huang, Jing']","['Shin MH', 'He Y', 'Marrogi E', 'Piperdi S', 'Ren L', 'Khanna C', 'Gorlick R', 'Liu C', 'Huang J']","['Cancer and Stem Cell Epigenetics Section, Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Epigenetics Section, Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Epigenetics Section, Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York, United States of America."", 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York, United States of America."", 'Transgenic Core Facility, Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Epigenetics Section, Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20160229,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (RUNX2 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4771715,,,2016/03/02 06:00,2016/07/13 06:00,['2016/03/02 06:00'],"['2015/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1005884 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-15-02538 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2016 Feb 29;12(2):e1005884. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005884. eCollection 2016 Feb.,,"['ZIA BC011504/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', '1ZIABC011504-02/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to test possible trends in incidence rate of early childhood leukemia (children <5 years old at the diagnosis) in Brazil. Data from 18 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) were analyzed (period 1999-2010). The analysis consisted of frequencies, age-adjusted incidence rates, and joinpoint regression results, including annual average percent change (AAPC) in incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The median age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of overall early childhood leukemia was 61 per million. The AAIR for acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) was 44 per million and nonlymphoid acute leukemia (NLAL) was 14 per million. The median ALL/NLAL ratio was 3.0, suggesting higher incidence rate of NLAL in these settings.

Based on literature reports of limited cases, over 50 % of BPDCN have chromosomal abnormalities, but no single chromosomal change has been identified as diagnostic of this entity. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present a case of BPDCN with complicated chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosomes 12 and 22 and resulting in a simultaneous partial deletion of ETV6 and EWSR1. Notably, these aberrations were identified in bone marrow myeloid precursors in the absence of bone marrow involvement by BPDCN. CONCLUSION: Analysis of 46 BPDCN cases with abnormal karyotypes (45 from literature reports plus this case) showed that 12p- is one of the most common structural aberrations in BPDCN.

In AML cells many chromosomal aberrations are observed, some of them being characteristic of a particular subtype of patients, and others being less significant. Besides chromosomal abnormalities, the leukemic cells can have a variety of mutations involving individual genes. The aim of this work was to investigate the frequencies of molecular alterations with the focus on FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations in AML patients of different age groups living in a southeastern region of Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 50 consecutive AML patients. We analyzed bone marrow samples by conventional cytogenetics. Cytogenetic evaluation in selected cases was complemented by the FISH technique. The internal tandem mutation in the FLT3 gene was identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the NPM1 mutation was assessed by direct nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: The studies using classical cytogenetics showed chromosomal aberrations in 32 (64%) patients. In 18 cases no changes in the karyotype were found by conventional karyotyping. FLT3-ITD mutation was detected in 4 (8%) patients and mutation of NPM1 in 3 patients with AML (6%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of both mutations in our study group was lower than described elsewhere. We have confirmed that FLT3-ITD occurred more commonly in older patients and it was associated with shorter overall survival. By contrast, mutation of exon 12 of the NPM1 gene seems to be a good prognostic factor in AML patients with normal karyotype.",,"['Koczkodaj, Dorota', 'Zmorzynski, Szymon', 'Michalak-Wojnowska, Malgorzata', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, Ewa', 'Filip, Agata A']","['Koczkodaj D', 'Zmorzynski S', 'Michalak-Wojnowska M', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E', 'Filip AA']","['Department of Cancer Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160202,Poland,Arch Med Sci,Archives of medical science : AMS,101258257,,,,PMC4754359,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'NPM1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'karyotype']",2016/03/01 06:00,2016/03/01 06:01,['2016/03/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/aoms.2015.49811 [doi]', '24818 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Med Sci. 2016 Feb 1;12(1):120-8. doi: 10.5114/aoms.2015.49811.

In contrast, even though increased vascularity has been commonly observed in bone marrows of patients with hematological malignancies (liquid tumors), the pathophysiology of leukemia-induced angiogenesis in the bone marrow remains elusive. This paper demonstrates the usage of a microengineered 3D biomimetic model to study leukemic-cell-induced bone marrow angiogenesis. Rational design of the 3D angiogenesis chip incorporating endothelial cells (ECs), leukemic cells, and bone marrow stromal fibroblasts provide an efficient biomimetic means to promote and visualize early angiogenic processes. Morphological features of angiogenesis induced by three different leukemic cell lines (U937, HL60, and K562) are investigated and compared. Quantitative measurements of angiogenic factors secreted from monocultures and cocultures of leukemic cells with bone marrow stromal fibroblasts suggest a synergistic relationship between ECs, leukemic cells, and bone marrow stromal fibroblasts for angiogenic induction, and also confirm the necessity of conducting functional angiogenic assays in proper 3D biomimetic cell culture systems like the one developed in this work.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Using a combined pharmacological screen and drug resistance selection approach in a murine model of Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we indeed find that temporal and/or persistent collateral sensitivity to non-classical BCR-ABL1 drugs arises in emergent tumor subpopulations during the evolution of resistance toward initial treatment with BCR-ABL1-targeted inhibitors. We determined the sensitization mechanism via genotypic, phenotypic, signaling, and binding measurements in combination with computational models and demonstrated significant overall survival extension in mice.

In vitro studies on downstream signalling and functional effects of CLL BCR ligation often report contradictory results, in part owing to the lack of a standardised stimulation protocol. Our aim was to define a biologically relevant and robust in vitro stimulation method with regard to cellular phenotypic and transcriptional responses. METHODS: We evaluated mRNA (FOS, MYC, LPL) and protein (CD54, CD19, CD62L, CD184) expression of genes modulated by BCR triggering in immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region genes (IGHV)-mutated and -unmutated CLL cells, after stimulation using soluble or immobilised anti-IgM antibodies from different suppliers. RESULTS: The effect of BCR stimulation on gene and protein expression was comparable in all CLL patients, irrespective of IGHV mutation status. However, immobilised anti-IgM stimulation elicited clear and robust changes in gene and protein expression, whereas the response to soluble anti-IgM was far less obvious. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the method of BCR stimulation is of major importance regarding responsiveness of CLL cells in the context of the tumour microenvironment, whereas genetic differences in the BCR pathway are less critical.",,"['Rombout, Ans', 'Lust, Sofie', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Naessens, Evelien', 'Verhasselt, Bruno', 'Philippe, Jan']","['Rombout A', 'Lust S', 'Offner F', 'Naessens E', 'Verhasselt B', 'Philippe J']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160225,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (anti-IgM)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (LPL protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins v-fos/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*blood/genetics/immunology', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC4800300,,,2016/03/01 06:00,2016/07/21 06:00,['2016/03/01 06:00'],"['2015/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc201635 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2016.35 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2016 Mar 15;114(6):704-12. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2016.35.

To treat monogenic, inherited diseases, retroviral vectors have been used to add correct genes into patient cells. Conventional gammaretroviral vectors achieved successful results in clinical trials: treated patients had therapeutic gene expression in target cells and had improved symptoms of diseases. However, serious side-effects of leukemia occurred, caused by retroviral insertional mutagenesis (IM). These incidences stressed the importance of monitoring vector integration sites in patient cells as well as of re-consideration on safer vectors. More recently lentiviral vectors which can deliver genes into non-dividing cells started to be used in clinical trials including neurological disorders, showing their efficacy. Vector integration site analysis revealed that lentiviruses integrate less likely to near promoter regions of oncogenes than gammaretroviruses and no adverse events have been reported in lentiviral vector-mediated gene therapy clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a risk-adapted intensity of busulfan at 130 mg/m(2)/day for either 2, 3, or 4 days, with a fixed dose of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days), and thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 days). Our algorithm was based on age, comorbiditie(s), and disease risk. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with hematological malignancies (median age, 37 years; range, 16-65 years), received an allograft from human leukocyte antigen identical siblings. Post-transplant therapy was initiated between days 30 and 60 after allo-HCT. Twenty-five of 26 patients who were planned for post allo-HCT therapy received it (10 with myeloid malignancies received 5-azacytidine, 5 with FLT-3 ITD acute myeloid leukemia received sorafenib, 4 with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis received dasatinib, or dasatinib followed by imatinib, and 5 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia received intrathecal cytarabine). The remaining 27 patients (51%) did not receive post-transplant therapy because of lack of approval by third-party payers. After a median follow-up of 13 months (range, 2-57 months), 1-year non-relapse-mortality was 2%, and cumulative incidences of grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease and all grades chronic graft-versus-host disease were 23% and 9%, respectively. The 2-year overall survival (95% vs. 61%; P = .04) and progression-free survival (81% vs. 53%; P = .05) were significantly better for patients in the post-transplant therapy group. CONCLUSION: This risk-adapted combined approach of selecting conditioning intensity and integrating post-transplant therapies results in lower non-relapse-mortality and encouraging improvement in survival. Our findings warrant confirmation in a large prospective multicenter trial.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The persistence and continued acquisition of mutations in resistant LSCs represent a major cause of refractory disease and/or relapse after remission. Understanding the mechanisms regulating LSC growth and survival is critical in devising effective therapies that will improve treatment response and outcome. Several recent studies indicate that the p53 tumor suppressor pathway is often inactivated in de novo myeloid leukemia through oncogenic-specific mechanisms, which converge on aberrant p53 protein deacetylation. Here, we summarize our current understanding of the various mechanisms underlying deregulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs), which could be exploited to restore p53 activity and enhance targeting of LSCs in molecularly defined patient subsets.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Colon cancer-associated transcript-1 (CCAT1) gene encodes an lncRNA whose over-activation was observed in an expanding list of primary human solid tumors and tumor cell lines, however its biological roles in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has not been reported yet at present. In this study, the aberrant upregulation of CCAT1 was detected in French-American-British M4 and M5 subtypes of adult AML patients. By gain- and loss-of-function analysis, we determined that CCAT1 repressed monocytic differentiation and promoted cell growth of HL-60 by sequestering tumor suppressive miR-155. Accordingly, a significant decrease in miR-155 level was detected in AML patients. Re-introduction of miR-155 into HL-60 cells restored monocytic maturation and repressed cell proliferation. Furthermore, CCAT1 could up-regulated c-Myc via its competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity on miR-155. In conclusion, these results revealed new mechanism of lncRNA CCAT1 in AML development, and suggested that the manipulation of CCAT1 expression could serve as a potential strategy in AML therapy.",,"['Chen, Lianxiang', 'Wang, Wei', 'Cao, Lixia', 'Li, Zhijun', 'Wang, Xing']","['Chen L', 'Wang W', 'Cao L', 'Li Z', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010059, China.', ""Department of Emergency, Inner Mongolia People's Hospital, Hohhot 010017, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010059, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Basic Medical College, The Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010059, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Basic Medical College, The Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010059, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160226,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (CCAT1 long noncoding RNA, human)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC4844940,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CCAT1', 'lncRNA', 'miR-155']",2016/03/01 06:00,2017/03/04 06:00,['2016/03/01 06:00'],"['2015/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.14348/molcells.2016.2308 [doi]', 'molcells.2016.2308 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2016 Apr 30;39(4):330-6. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2016.2308.

The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) quantitative PCR established in this study and a commercial ELISA kit revealed that 49.1% of dairy cattle (964/1,963) from 6 provinces of China and 1.6% of beef cattle (22/1,390) from 15 provinces were BLV positive. In a detailed study of 105 cows, BLV was found most commonly in buffy coat samples that also had highest copy numbers (10(4.75+/-1.56) per mL); all cows negative for BLV in buffy coat samples were also negative in vaginal swab, milk, and fecal samples. Copy numbers of BLV were 10(2.90+/-0.42)/gram of feces, 10(0.83+/-0.62)/mL of milk, and 10(2.18+/-0.81) per vaginal swab. The BLV-positive cows had significantly lower milk production in the early (26.8 vs. 30.9kg) and middle stages of lactation (22.2 vs. 26.1kg) in animals with >/=4 parities than the BLV-negative cows; they also had significantly higher SCS in early and middle lactation stages (early=5.2 vs. 4.3; middle=4.9 vs. 3.9) in animals with >/=4 parities. Milk production and SCS did not significantly differ between the BLV-infected and -uninfected cows when they were in the late lactation stage or in animals with </=3 parities. Taken together, our results indicate that BLV infections are widespread in the dairy farms of China. Vaginal secretions and feces may be involved in BLV transmission. A BLV infection may result in reduced milk yield and increased SCS in a parity and lactation stage-restricted manner.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

In the present study, we investigated NOVA1 expression in various subtypes of mature and immature T- and natural killer (NK)-cell lymphomas as well as in various B-cell lymphoma subtypes. METHODS: NOVA1 immunoexpression was evaluated in hyperplastic palatine tonsils (n = 20), T- and NK-cell lymphomas (n = 177), diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n = 151), and other types of B cell lymphomas (n = 31). Nuclear staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells were graded. NOVA1 mRNA expression was analyzed in various lymphoma cell lines. RESULTS: Tumor cells of T- and NK-cell lymphomas showed higher expression levels of NOVA1 than did normal paracortical T cells, and 56.5% of T- and NK-cell lymphoma cases showed diffuse and strong expression. The NOVA1 expression level varied according to the subtype; it was higher in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-LBL), but it was lower in ALK-positive ALCL. In almost all B-cell lymphomas, NOVA1 expression was very low or negative. NOVA1 mRNA was also expressed in Jurkat, a T-LBL cell line. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that NOVA1 upregulation may be involved in certain subtypes of T- and NK-cell lymphomas, but not in B-cell lymphomas. Upregulated NOVA1 expression seems to be a specific biological feature of activated T cells such as T- and NK-cell lymphomas.",,"['Kim, Eun Kyung', 'Yoon, Sun Och', 'Kim, Soo Hee', 'Yang, Woo Ick', 'Cho, Yoon Ah', 'Kim, Soo Jeong']","['Kim EK', 'Yoon SO', 'Kim SH', 'Yang WI', 'Cho YA', 'Kim SJ']","['Department of Pathology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Anatomic Pathology Reference Lab, Seegene Medical Foundation, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160229,Korea (South),J Pathol Transl Med,Journal of pathology and translational medicine,101650151,,,,PMC4804152,['NOTNLM'],"['Lymphoma, T-cell', 'NK cell lymphoma', 'NOVA1', 'Splicing factor']",2016/02/29 06:00,2016/02/29 06:01,['2016/02/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4132/jptm.2016.02.08 [doi]', 'jptm.2016.02.08 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pathol Transl Med. 2016 Mar;50(2):104-12. doi: 10.4132/jptm.2016.02.08.

To assess the effects of therapeutic ionizing radiation for the treatment of solid neoplasms we studied CLL risks in data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Specifically, we compared the risks of developing CLL in persons with a 1(st) non-hematologic cancer treated with or without ionizing radiation. We controlled for early detection effects on CLL risk induced by surveillance after 1(st) cancer diagnoses by forming all-time cumulative CLL relative risks (RR). We estimate such CLL RR to be 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.17, 1.23) for persons whose 1(st) cancer was not treated with ionizing radiation and 1.00 (0.96, 1.05) for persons whose 1(st) cancer was treated with ionizing radiations.

The long-term toxicities, particularly cardiopulmonary side effects, are now impacting treatment choice, making patient comorbidities of significant concern. About 10 % of patients do not tolerate their initial BCR-ABL1 TKI and an increasing number are developing long-term side effects, particularly with the second generation drugs. Side effects of the five drugs reviewed here highlight the differences between cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and endocrine toxicities, as well as possible second malignancies.

METHODS: MTT assays were used to measure the proliferation-inhibition ratio of K562 and K562/G01 cells. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to test the level of extracellular ROS, DNA damage, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Western blotting was used to verify the amount of protein. RESULTS: FM-Nov17 significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells, with an IC50 of 58.28+/-0.304muM, and K562/G01 cells, with an IC50 of 62.36+/-0.136muM. FM-Nov17 significantly stimulated the generation of intracellular ROS, followed by the induction of DNA damage and the activation of the ATM-p53-r-H2AX pathway and checkpoint-related signals Chk1/Chk2, which led to increased numbers of cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, FM-Nov17 induced apoptotic cell death by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and activating caspase-3 and PARP. The above effects were all prevented by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. CONCLUSIONS: FM-Nov17-induces DNA damage and mitochondria-dependent cellular apoptosis in CML cells. The process is mediated by the generation of ROS.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.', 'Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

Although the effects of MAC on apoptosis have been reported, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that MAC promoted apoptotic cell death and downregulated c-Myc expression in K562 human leukemia cells. The effect of MAC on apoptosis was similar to that of 10058-F4 (a c-Myc inhibitor) or c-Myc siRNA, suggesting that the downregulation of c-Myc expression plays a role in the apoptotic effect of MAC. Further investigation showed that MAC downregulated c-Myc by inhibiting protein synthesis. MAC promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibited the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its target proteins, including p70S6 K and 4E-BP-1. Treatment of cells with AICAR (an AMPK activator), rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor), or mTOR siRNA downregulated c-Myc expression and induced apoptosis to a similar extent to that of MAC.

It is also in clinical trials for the treatment of other malignancies, including solid tumors. Despite its wide use, little is known of its effects on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Here, we study wild-type mice dosed with dasatinib and find that it causes the transient induction of proliferation of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This finding was unexpected given the ability of dasatinib to inhibit c-Kit signaling and promote cell cycle arrest in many cell types. The transient induction of HSC proliferation in dasatinib-dosed mice coincided with a marked induction in the expression of Sca-1 and phospho-S6. Also evident at this time was a rapid but transient loss of lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors that express high levels of c-Kit and the induction of stem cell factor in the serum. These findings suggest that activation of quiescent HSCs is part of a rapid rescue response that restores hematopoietic progenitors to pretreatment levels. This restoration coincides with HSCs returning to quiescence, and the expression of Sca-1 and phospho-S6 reverting to pre-treatment levels, even though dasatinib dosing is maintained. These data suggest that equilibrium is reached between the opposing forces of dasatinib and hematopoietic growth factors. The transient induction of HSC proliferation provided a window of opportunity whereby these cells became sensitive to killing by the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is not clear whether the optimal dose should be 3 mg/m(2) or 6 mg/m(2) In this study, we randomized 788 patients to a single dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 3 mg/m(2) or 6 mg/m(2) with the first course of induction therapy. We found that the rate of complete remission was higher with 3 mg/m(2) [82% vs 76%; odds ratio 1.46 (1.04-2.06); P=0.03], but this was balanced by a higher rate of complete remission with incomplete peripheral blood count recovery in the 6 mg/m(2) treatment (10% vs 7%) resulting in similar overall response rate [89% vs 86%; hazard ratio 1.34 (0.88-2.04); P=0.17]. There was no overall difference in relapse or survival at four years between the arms: 46% vs 54%; hazard ratio 1.17 (0.94-1.45), P=0.5, and 50% versus 47%; hazard ratio 1.10 (0.90-1.34), P=0.3, respectively. The 30- and 60-day mortality was significantly higher in the 6 mg/m(2) recipients: 7% versus 3%; hazard ratio 2.07 (1.11-3.87), P=0.02, and 9% versus 5%; hazard ratio 1.99 (1.17-3.39), P=0.01, respectively, which in addition was associated with a higher rate of veno-occlusive disease (5.6% vs 0.5%; P<0.0001). Our conclusion from this trial is that there is no advantage in using a single dose of 6 mg/m(2) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with induction chemotherapy when compared with a 3 mg/m(2) dose, with respect to response, disease-free and overall survival, either overall, or in any disease subgroup.

Prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (PHD1-3) are molecular oxygen sensors that regulate hypoxia-inducible factor activity, but their functions in metastatic disease remain unclear. Here, we assessed the significance of PHD enzymes during the metastatic spread of colorectal cancer. PHD expression analysis in 124 colorectal cancer patients revealed that reduced tumoral expression of PHD3 correlated with increased frequency of distant metastases and poor outcome. Tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of colorectal tumor cells over and underexpressing PHD3 were investigated in orthotopic and heterotopic tumor models. PHD3 overexpression in a syngeneic tumor model resulted in fewer liver metastases, whereas PHD3 knockdown induced tumor spread. The migration of PHD3-overexpressing tumor cells was also attenuated in vitro Conversely, migratory potential and colony formation were enhanced in PHD3-deficient cells, and this phenotype was associated with enhanced mitochondrial ATP production. Furthermore, the effects of PHD3 deficiency were accompanied by increased mitochondrial expression of the BCL-2 family member, member myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1), and could be reversed by simultaneous inhibition of MCL-1. MCL-1 protein expression was likewise enhanced in human colorectal tumors expressing low levels of PHD3. Therefore, we demonstrate that downregulation of PHD3 augments metastatic spread in human colorectal cancer and identify MCL-1 as a novel downstream effector of oxygen sensing. Importantly, these findings offer new insight into the possible, context-specific deleterious effects of pharmacologic PHD inhibition. Cancer Res; 76(8); 2219-30.

The VH-CH1-hinge domains of mAb2 are fused through a peptidic linker to the N terminus of mAb1 H chain, and paired mutations at the CH1-CL interface mAb1 are introduced that force the correct pairing of the two different free L chains. Two different sets of these CH1-CL interface mutations, called CR3 and MUT4, were designed and tested, and prototypic bispecific Abs directed against CD5 and HLA-DR were produced (CD5xDR). Two different hinge sequences between mAb1 and mAb2 were also tested in the CD5xDR-CR3 or -MUT4 background, leading to bispecific Ab (BsAbs) with a more rigid or flexible structure. All four Abs produced bound with good specificity and affinity to CD5 and HLA-DR present either on the same target or on different cells. Indeed, the BsAbs were able to efficiently redirect killing of HLA-DR(+) leukemic cells by human CD5(+) cytokine-induced killer T cells. Finally, all BsAbs had a functional Fc, as shown by their capacity to activate human complement and NK cells and to mediate phagocytosis. CD5xDR-CR3 was chosen as the best format because it had overall the highest functional activity and was very stable in vitro in both neutral buffer and in serum.

The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is frequently amplified in BC; and elevated Mcl-1 levels have been correlated with poor prognosis. Here we investigated the pathophysiologic role of Mcl-1 in Her2-positive BC cells under hypoxic conditions. METHODS: RNA interference and a novel small molecule inhibitor, EU-5346, were used to examine the role of Mcl-1 in Her2-positive BC cell lines and primary BC cells (sensitive or intrinsically resistant to Her2 inhibitors) under hypoxic conditions (using a hypoxic incubation chamber). Mechanisms-of-action were investigated by RT-PCR, mitochondrial isolation, as well as immunoprecipitation/blotting analysis, and microscopy. The specificity against Mcl-1 of the novel small molecule inhibitor EU5346 was verified in Mcl-1(Delta/null) versus Mcl-1(wt/wt) Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs). Proliferation, survival, and spheroid formation were assessed in response to Mcl-1 and Her2 inhibition. RESULTS: We demonstrate for a strong correlation between high Mcl-1 protein levels and hypoxia, predominantly in Her2-positive BC cells. Surprisingly, genetic depletion of Mcl-1 decreased Her2 and Hif-1alpha levels followed by inhibition of BC cell survival. In contrast, Mcl-1 protein levels were not downregulated after genetic depletion of Her2 indicating a regulatory role of Mcl-1 upstream of Her2. Indeed, Mcl-1 and Her2 co-localize within the mitochondrial fraction and form a Mcl-1/Her2- protein complex. Similar to genetically targeting Mcl-1 the novel small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitor EU-5346 induced cell death and decreased spheroid formation in Her2-positive BC cells. Of interest, EU-5346 induced ubiquitination of Mcl-1- bound Her2 demonstrating a previously unknown role for Mcl-1 to stabilize Her2 protein levels. Importantly, targeting Mcl-1 was also active in Her2-positive BC cells resistant to Her2 inhibitors, including a brain-primed Her2-positive cell line. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate a critical role of Mcl-1 in Her2-positive BC cell survival under hypoxic conditions and provide the preclinical framework for the therapeutic use of novel Mcl-1- targeting agents to improve patient outcome in BC.",,"['Bashari, Muhammad Hasan', 'Fan, Fengjuan', 'Vallet, Sonia', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Arn, Melissa', 'Luckner-Minden, Claudia', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Zornig, Inka', 'Marme, Frederik', 'Schneeweiss, Andreas', 'Cardone, Michael H', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Jager, Dirk', 'Podar, Klaus']","['Bashari MH', 'Fan F', 'Vallet S', 'Sattler M', 'Arn M', 'Luckner-Minden C', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Zornig I', 'Marme F', 'Schneeweiss A', 'Cardone MH', 'Opferman JT', 'Jager D', 'Podar K']","['Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld #460, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jl.

Less than 50% of patients experience long-term survival and for those adults over age 60, long-term survival is only 10%. At time of relapse, 5-year prognosis is a dismal 7%. Novel and less toxic agents are urgently needed. The last few years have seen a surge in immune therapies for B-ALL. These agents may target CD19, CD20, CD22, and less frequently CD52. Expression of these surface markers and the drugs which target them are discussed. Some immune therapies are simple monoclonal antibodies against B lymphocyte markers such as rituximab, ofatumumab, and epratuzumab. Others are in a class of antibody-drug conjugates which link a highly toxic chemotherapy to a monoclonal antibody for targeted delivery, such as inotuzumab and denintuzumab. Finally, novel immune therapies recruit (in the case of bispecific T cell engager [BiTE]) or modify (in the case of chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T cells) one's own T cells to fight leukemic cells.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Quizartinib was administered orally to children with relapsed AML or MLL-rearranged ALL following 5 days of high-dose cytarabine and etoposide (AE). A 3+3 dose escalation design was used to identify a safe and biologically active dose. Plasma inhibitory assay (PIA) testing was performed weekly to determine biologic activity. RESULTS: Toxicities were consistent with intensive relapsed leukemia regimens. One of 6 patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at 40 mg/m(2)/day (elevated lipase) and 1 of 9 had a DLT (hyperbilirubinemia) at the highest tested dose of 60 mg/m(2)/day. Of 17 response evaluable patients, 2 had complete response (CR), 1 complete response without platelet recovery (CRp), 1 complete response with incomplete neutrophil and platelet recovery (CRi), 10 stable disease (SD), and 3 progressive disease (PD). Of 7 FLT3-ITD patients, 1 achieved CR, 1 CRp, 1 Cri, and 4 SD. FLT3-ITD patients, but not FLT3 wild-type (WT) patients, had significantly lower blast counts post-quizartinib. FLT3 phosphorylation was completely inhibited in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Quizartinib plus intensive chemotherapy is well tolerated at 60 mg/m(2)/day with near complete inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation in all patients. The favorable toxicity profile, pharmacodynamic activity, and encouraging response rates warrant further testing of quizartinib in children with FLT3-ITD AML. Clin Cancer Res; 22(16); 4014-22.

Treatment of this leukemia with ATRA in combination with chemotherapy has resulted in complete remission rates >90 % and long-term remission rates above 80 %. Furthermore, the combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO) was shown to be safe and effective in frontline treatment and, for patients with low and intermediate risk disease, possibly superior to the standard ATRA and anthracycline-based regimen. However, in spite of this tremendous progress, APL still remains associated with a high incidence of early death due to the frequent occurrence of an abrupt bleeding diathesis. This hemorrhagic syndrome more frequently develops in high-risk APL patients, currently defined as those exhibiting >10 x 10(9)/L WBC at presentation. In addition to high WBC count, other molecular and immunophenotypic features have been associated with high-risk APL. Among them, the expression in APL blasts of the stem/progenitor cell antigen CD34, the neural adhesion molecule (CD56), and the T cell antigen CD2 help to identify a subset of patients at higher risk of relapse and often the expression of these markers is associated with high WBC count. At the molecular level, the short PML/RARA isoform and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations have been associated with increased relapse risk. These observations indicate that extended immunophenotypic and molecular characterization of APL at diagnosis including evaluation of CD2, CD56, and CD34 antigens and of FLT3 mutations may help to better design risk-adapted treatment in this disease.",,"['Testa, Ugo', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Testa U', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. ugo.testa@iss.it.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Neuro-Oncohematology, Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160226,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology/mortality', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/complications/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/blood/genetics', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Membrane markers', 'Prognosis']",2016/02/28 06:00,2016/08/12 06:00,['2016/02/28 06:00'],"['2015/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2622-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2622-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Apr;95(5):673-80. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2622-1.

After encountering four patients with both disorders, we prospectively screened 38 patients with inclusion body myositis for the presence of expanded large granular lymphocyte populations by standard clinical laboratory methods (flow cytometry, examination of blood smears, and T cell receptor gene rearrangements), and performed muscle immunohistochemistry for CD8, CD57, and TIA1. Most (22/38; 58%) patients with inclusion body myositis had aberrant populations of large granular lymphocytes in their blood meeting standard diagnostic criteria for T cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia. These T cell populations were clonal in 20/20 patients and stably present on follow-up testing in 15 patients a median of 350 days later. T cell aberrant loss of CD5 or gain of expression of CD16 and CD94 were common (19/42, 45%). In comparison, 2/15 (14%) age-matched patients with dermatomyositis, polymyositis, or necrotizing myopathy, and 0/20 (0%) age-matched healthy subjects had large granular lymphocyte expansions, with none of these patients having T cell aberrant expression of CD5, CD16 or CD94. Reduced blood CD4/CD8 ratio, increased blood CD8 count, and lymphocytosis were additional biomarkers highly correlated with flow cytometry-measured large granular lymphocyte expansions. Cross-sectional data suggested more aggressive disease in patients with such expansions than without. Muscle immunohistochemistry demonstrated invasion of large granular lymphocytes into muscle in 15/15 inclusion body myositis patients but in only 1/28 patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis. The extent of CD8+ and CD57+ cells in inclusion body myositis muscle correlated with the size of blood large granular lymphocyte populations. Myofibre-invading cells expressed CD57, a marker of persistent T cell exposure to antigen and T cell aggressiveness. In many patients with inclusion body myositis, the autoimmune T cell expansion has evolved into a neoplastic-like or overtly neoplastic disorder, perhaps contributing to its relative refractoriness to immune-directed therapies previously reported.","['(c) The Author (2016).

METHODS: The data are extracted from eight Advocate Health Care hospitals. Index admissions are excluded from the cohort if they are observation, inpatient admissions for psychiatry, skilled nursing, hospice, rehabilitation, maternal and newborn visits, or if the patient expires during the index admission. Data are randomly and repeatedly divided into fitting and validating sets for cross validations. Approaches including LACE, STEPWISE logistic, LASSO logistic, and AdaBoost, are compared with sample sizes varying from 2,500 to 80,000. RESULTS: Our results confirm that LACE has moderate discrimination power with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) around 0.65-0.66, which can be improved to 0.73-0.74 when additional variables from EMR are considered. These variables include Inpatient in the last six months, Number of emergency room visits or inpatients in the last year, Braden score, Polypharmacy, Employment status, Discharge disposition, Albumin level, and medical condition variables such as Leukemia, Malignancy, Renal failure with hemodialysis, History of alcohol substance abuse, Dementia and Trauma. When sample size is small (</=5000), LASSO is the best; when sample size is large (>/=20,000), the predictive performance is similar. The STEPWISE method has a slightly lower AUC (0.734) comparing to LASSO (0.737) and AdaBoost (0.737). More than one half of the selected predictors can be false positives when using a single method and a single division of fitting/validating data. CONCLUSIONS: True predictors can be identified by repeatedly dividing data into fitting/validating subsets and referring the final model based on summarizing results. LASSO is a better alternative to the STEPWISE logistic regression, especially when sample size is not large. The evidence for adequate sample size can be explored by fitting models on gradually reduced samples. Our model comparison strategy is not only good for 30-day all-cause non-elective readmission risk predictions, but also applicable to other types of predictive models in clinical studies.",,"['Tong, Liping', 'Erdmann, Cole', 'Daldalian, Marina', 'Li, Jing', 'Esposito, Tina']","['Tong L', 'Erdmann C', 'Daldalian M', 'Li J', 'Esposito T']","['Advocate Health Care, 3075 Highland Parkway, Downers Grove, IL, 60515, USA. liping.tong@advocatehealth.com.', 'Cerner Corporation, World Headquarters, 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, MO, 64117, USA.

In the present study, we evaluated the potential anti-AML activity by a novel Akt kinase inhibitor A-674563. Our results showed that A-674563 dose-dependently inhibited survival and proliferation of U937 AML cells and six lines of human AML progenitor cells, yet sparing human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMCs). A-674563 activated caspase-3/9 and apoptosis in the AML cells. Reversely, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-CHO dramatically alleviated A-674563-induced AML cell apoptosis and cytotoxicity. For the molecular study, we showed that A-674563 blocked Akt activation in U937 cells and human AML progenitor cells. Further, A-674563 decreased sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) activity in above AML cells to deplete pro-survival sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and boost pro-apoptotic ceramide production. Such an effect on SphK1 signaling by A-674563 appeared independent of Akt blockage. Significantly, K6PC-5, a novel SphK1 activator, or supplement with S1P attenuated A-674563-induced ceramide production, and subsequent U937 cell death and apoptosis. Importantly, intraperitoneal injection of A-674563 at well-tolerated doses suppressed U937 leukemic xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, whiling significantly improving the animal survival. The results of the current study demonstrate that A-674563 exerts potent anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo, possibly via concurrent targeting Akt and SphK1 signalings.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We present a case report of a 57-year-old-male patient who was diagnosed in 2009 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He received two standard induction chemotherapies, as well as a following consolidation. Six months later, an allogeneic HSCT was performed. Shortly after HSCT the patient developed progressive polyneuropathy of the lower legs and hypoesthesia. Five months later a severe dementia followed. All images of the brain and spine showed no specific pathologies. High dose corticosteroids and immunoglobulins did not improve the neurologic symptoms. Due to severe worsening of the neuropsychiatric status and the clinical presentation, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) was suspected. Therefore, the patient received ten cycles of plasmapheresis. The patient showed a significant improvement of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive status.

Presence of ETV6/RUNX1 alone is usually not sufficient for leukemia onset, and additional genetic alterations have to occur in ETV6/RUNX1-positive cells to cause transformation. We have previously generated an ETV6/RUNX1 transgenic mouse model where the expression of the fusion gene is restricted to CD19-positive B cells. Since BCL2 family members have been proposed to play a role in leukemogenesis, we investigated combined effects of ETV6/RUNX1 with exogenous expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 by crossing ETV6/RUNX1 transgenic animals with Vav-BCL2 transgenic mice. Strikingly, co-expression of ETV6/RUNX1 and BCL2 resulted in significantly shorter disease latency in mice, indicating oncogene cooperativity. This was associated with faster development of follicular B cell lymphoma and exacerbated immune complex glomerulonephritis. ETV6/RUNX1-BCL2 double transgenic animals displayed increased B cell numbers and immunoglobulin titers compared to Vav-BCL2 transgenic mice. This led to pronounced deposition of immune complexes in glomeruli followed by accelerated development of immune complex glomerulonephritis.

We have previously shown that transcriptome and proteomic effects do not correlate well in oncogene-mediated leukemogenesis. We therefore investigated the effects of MPL W515L using proteomics. The consequences of MPL W515L expression on over 3300 nuclear and 3500 cytoplasmic proteins were assessed using relative quantification mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that MPL W515L expression markedly modulates the CXCL12/CXCR4/CD45 pathway associated with stem and progenitor cell chemotactic movement. We also demonstrated that MPL W515L expressing cells displayed increased chemokinesis which required the MPL W515L-mediated dysregulation of MYC expression via phosphorylation of the RNA transport protein THOC5 on tyrosine 225. In addition MPL W515L expression induced TGFbeta secretion which is linked to sphingosine 1-phosphate production and the increased chemokinesis. These studies identify several pathways which offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of MPL W515L-driven malignancy. We validate our approach by showing that CD34+ cells from MPL W515L positive patients display increased chemokinesis and that treatment with a combination of MYC and sphingosine kinase inhibitors leads to the preferential killing of MPL W515L expressing cells.,,"['Whetton, Anthony D', 'Azmi, Norhaida Che', 'Pearson, Stella', 'Jaworska, Ewa', 'Zhang, Liqun', 'Blance, Rognvald', 'Kendall, Alexandra C', 'Nicolaou, Anna', 'Taylor, Samuel', 'Williamson, Andrew J K', 'Pierce, Andrew']","['Whetton AD', 'Azmi NC', 'Pearson S', 'Jaworska E', 'Zhang L', 'Blance R', 'Kendall AC', 'Nicolaou A', 'Taylor S', 'Williamson AJ', 'Pierce A']","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Pharmacy School, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Pharmacy School, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (THOC5 protein, human)', '0 (THOC5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",PMC4905435,['NOTNLM'],"['MPLW515L', 'MYC', 'S1P', 'THOC5', 'chemokinesis']",2016/02/27 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2016/02/27 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['7639 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7639 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Mar 8;7(10):10739-55. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7639.,,['MR/N00583X/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Butein was found to significantly suppress the cellular proliferation of ALL cell lines and primary ALL blasts in a dose-dependent manner. It also induced cell cycle arrest by decreasing the expression of cyclin E and CDK2.

Moreover, we showed that FOXO3a knockdown significantly decreased the proliferation inhibition by butein, whereas overexpression of FOXO3a enhanced the butein-mediated proliferation inhibition.

Although treatment with the Bcr-Abl-inhibitor imatinib represents the first-line therapy against CML, almost 20-30% of patients develop chemotherapeutic resistance and require alternative therapy. Here we show that a strong hyper-phosphorylation/activation of ERK1/2, Akt Ser473, and 40S ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is detectable in imatinib-resistant KCL22 and K562 CML cells as compared to the -sensitive cell variants. In imatinib-resistant CML cells, high concentration of imatinib is required to strongly inhibit Bcr-Abl, ERK1/2 and Akt Ser473 phosphorylation, but under these conditions the phosphorylation of rpS6, a common downstream effector of MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways is only slightly reduced. By contrast, down-regulation of the protein kinase CK2 by the inhibitor CX-5011 or by silencing the CK2 subunits does not affect the activation state of MEK/ERK1/2 or PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling, but causes a drop in rpS6 phosphorylation in parallel with reduced protein synthesis. CK2-inhibition by CX-5011 induces cell death by apoptosis and acts synergistically with imatinib or the MEK-inhibitor U0126 in reducing the viability of imatinib-resistant CML cells. The ternary mixture containing CX-5011, imatinib and U0126 represents the most effective synergistic combination to counteract CML cell viability. These results disclose a novel CK2-mediated mechanism of acquired imatinib-resistance resulting in hyper-phosphorylation of rpS6.

Understanding of the stemness-regulating signaling pathways incurred by a specific etiology can facilitate the development of novel targets for individualized therapy against HCC. Niche environments, such as virus-induced inflammation, may play a crucial role. However, the mechanisms linking inflammation and stemness expression in HCC remain unclear. Here we demonstrated the distinct role of inflammatory mediators in expressions of stemness-related properties involving the pluripotent octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) in cell migration and drug resistance of hepatitis B virus-related HCC (HBV-HCC). We observed positive immunorecognition for macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)/CD68 and OCT4/NANOG in HBV-HCC tissues. The inflammation-conditioned medium (inflamed-CM) generated by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated U937 human leukemia cells significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of OCT4/NANOG preferentially in HBV-active (HBV+HBsAg+) HCC cells. The inflamed-CM also increased the side population (SP) cell percentage, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cell population, and luciferase activity of OCT4 promoter-GFP/luciferase in HBV-active HCC cells. Furthermore, the inflamed-CM upregulated the expressions of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)/IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and activated IGF-IR/Akt signaling in HBV-HCC. The IGF-IR phosphorylation inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP) suppressed inflamed-CM-induced OCT4 and NANOG levels in HBV+HBsAg+ Hep3B cells. Forced expression of OCT4 significantly increased the secondary sphere formation and cell migration, and reduced susceptibility of HBV-HCC cells to cisplatin, bleomycin, and doxorubicin. Taking together, our results show that niche inflammatory mediators play critical roles in inducing the expression of stemness-related properties involving IGF-IR activation, and the upregulation of OCT4 contributes to cancer migration and drug resistance of HBV-HCC cells.

Therefore, vectors with 4-12 A's in the A bulge in the J-K bifurcation domain were generated, and the impact of the variants on transgene protein expression, vector stability, and IRES sequence upon multiple infection cycles was assessed in RRV encoding yeast-derived cytosine deaminase and green fluorescent protein in vitro. For transgene protein expression, after multiple infection cycles, RRV-IRES with 5-7 A's gave roughly comparable levels, 4 and 8 A's were within about 4-5-fold of the 6 A's, whereas 10 and 12 A's were marked lower. In terms of stability, after 10 infection cycles, expansion of A's appeared to be a more frequent event affecting transgene protein expression than viral genome deletions or rearrangement: 4 and 5 A's appeared completely stable; 6, 7, and particularly 8 A's showed some level of expansion in the A bulge; 10 and 12 A's underwent both expansion and transgene deletion.

Besides cyclooxygenase, AMPK is another target of the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agent aspirin. Preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrate that aspirin can inhibit several types of cancer such as colorectal adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about the cellular response to aspirin that may lead to aspirin resistance. Here, we show that aspirin induces the expression of MCL-1 in HepG2 and SW480 cells through AMPK-mTOR-Akt/ERK axis. Treatment of HepG2 and SW480 cells with aspirin leads to increased MCL-1 expression, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Akt/MEK abrogates the induction of MCL-1 by aspirin. Aspirin activates AMPK, which in turn up-regulates mTORC2 activity, Akt, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and MCL-1 expression. MCL-1 knockdown sensitizes cancer cells to aspirin-induced apoptosis. Combination of aspirin and AMPK, Akt or MEK inhibitor results in more significant inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis than single agent. Moreover, sorafenib blocks aspirin-induced MCL-1 up-regulation. Combination of aspirin and sorafenib leads to much more cell death and less cell proliferation than each drug alone. Treatment of HCC and colon cancer xenografts with both aspirin and sorafenib results in more significant tumor suppression than single agent. These data demonstrate that AMPK-mediated up-regulation of mTORC2 and MCL-1 may compromise the anticancer effects of aspirin.

Activation of oncogenic signalling proteins AKT and ERK by phosphorylation has an established role in the development of lung cancer and has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of emphysema. The aim of this study was to compare the protein level and phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK in paired lung cancer and emphysema tissue using a highly sensitive phosphoprotein analysis approach. METHODS: An antibody-based, nanocapillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) assay was used to determine the relative quantities and phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK in tumour and matched lung tissue from patients, with or without evidence of emphysema, undergoing curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: 20 patients with adenocarcinoma (n=9) or squamous cell carcinoma (n=11) of the lung were included (mean age 67.3 years (SD 7.5, range 47-80 years)), 12 were men and all were current (n=10) or former smokers (n=10). Paired macroscopically normal lung tissue was either histologically normal (n=7) or showed emphysema (n=13). Total and phosphorylated AKT levels were fourfold (p=0.0001) and fivefold (p=0.001) higher in tumour compared with matched lung, respectively. There was no correlation with tumour histology, stage or differentiation; however, total AKT signal in tumour was significantly correlated with fluorodeoxyglucose avidity on positron emission tomography-CT scan (r=0.53, p=0.035). Total ERK was not differentially expressed, but doubly phosphorylated (activated) ERK was threefold higher in emphysema (23.5%, SD 9.2) than either matched tumour (8.8%, SD 8.6) or normal lung tissue (8.3%, SD 9.0) and correlated with the histological severity of emphysema (p=0.005).

This oncogene is generated by the fusion of breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and Abelson leukemia virus (ABL) genes and encodes a novel fusion gene translating into a protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. The discovery and introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) irreversibly changed the landscape of CML treatment, leading to dramatic improvement in long-term survival rates. The majority of patients with CML in the chronic phase have a life expectancy comparable with that of healthy age-matched individuals. Although an enormous therapeutic improvement has been accomplished, there are still some unresolved issues in the treatment of patients with CML. One of the most important problems is based on the fact that TKIs can efficiently target proliferating mature cells but do not eradicate leukemic stem cells, allowing persistence of the malignant clone. Owing to the resistance mechanisms arising during the course of the disease, treatment with most of the approved BCR-ABL1 TKIs may become ineffective in a proportion of patients. This article highlights the different molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance being developed during treatment with TKIs as well as the pharmacological strategies to overcome it. Moreover, it gives an overview of novel drugs and therapies that are aiming in overcoming drug resistance, loss of response, and kinase domain mutations.",,"['Wieczorek, Agnieszka', 'Uharek, Lutz']","['Wieczorek A', 'Uharek L']","['Charite, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160218,United States,Biomark Insights,Biomarker insights,101288638,,,,PMC4760672,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'CML', 'patient management', 'resistance']",2016/02/27 06:00,2016/02/27 06:01,['2016/02/27 06:00'],"['2015/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4137/BMI.S22431 [doi]', 'bmi-suppl.3-2015-049 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Insights. 2016 Feb 18;10(Suppl 3):49-54. doi: 10.4137/BMI.S22431. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapamycin analogs, which partially inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), exhibit immunosuppressive and limited antitumor activity, but sometimes activate survival pathways through feedback mechanisms involving mTORC2. Thus, attention has turned to agents targeting both mTOR complexes by binding the mTOR active site. Here we show that disruption of either mTOR-containing complex is toxic to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells and identify 2 previously unrecognized pathways leading to this cell death. Inhibition of mTORC1-mediated 4EBP1 phosphorylation leads to decreased expression of c-MYC and subsequent upregulation of the proapoptotic BCL2 family member PUMA, whereas inhibition of mTORC2 results in nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated expression of the Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) gene, which encodes a transcription factor that binds and transactivates the proapoptotic BCL2L11 locus encoding BIM. Importantly, 1 or both pathways contribute to death of malignant lymphoid cells after treatment with dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors. Collectively, these observations not only provide new insight into the survival roles of mTOR in lymphoid malignancies, but also identify alterations that potentially modulate the action of mTOR dual inhibitors in ALL.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Yun, Seongseok', 'Vincelette, Nicole D', 'Knorr, Katherine L B', 'Almada, Luciana L', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Peterson, Kevin L', 'Flatten, Karen S', 'Dai, Haiming', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Hendrickson, Andrea E Wahner', 'Fernandez-Zapico, Martin E', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Yun S', 'Vincelette ND', 'Knorr KL', 'Almada LL', 'Schneider PA', 'Peterson KL', 'Flatten KS', 'Dai H', 'Pratz KW', 'Hess AD', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Hendrickson AE', 'Fernandez-Zapico ME', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and.', 'Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;', 'Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;', 'Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;', 'Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD; and.', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD; and.', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD; and.', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD; and.', 'Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Department of Medicine and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Department of Medicine and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160225,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC4891953,,,2016/02/27 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/02/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34523-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-02-629485 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 2;127(22):2711-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-02-629485.

The four main subtypes have different clinical profiles, particularly between chronic and acute types. AIM: To identify the symptom profiles of chronic and acute leukaemia in adults in primary care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Matched case-control studies using Clinical Practice Research Datalink records. METHOD: Putative symptoms of leukaemia were identified in the year before diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was used for analysis, and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated to estimate risk. RESULTS: Of cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2009, 4655 were aged >/=40 years (2877 chronic leukaemia (CL), 937 acute leukaemia (AL), 841 unreported subtype). Ten symptoms were independently associated with CL, the three strongest being: lymphadenopathy (odds ratio [OR] 22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 13 to 36), weight loss (OR 3.0, 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.2), and bruising (OR 2.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 3.2). Thirteen symptoms were independently associated with AL, the three strongest being: nosebleeds and/or bleeding gums (OR 5.7, 95% CI = 3.1 to 10), fever (OR 5.3, 95% CI = 2.7 to 10), and fatigue (OR 4.4, 95% CI = 3.3 to 6.0). No individual symptom or combination of symptoms had a PPV >1%. CONCLUSION: The symptom profiles of CL and AL have both overlapping and distinct features. This presents a dichotomy for GPs: diagnosis, by performing a full blood count, is easy; however, the symptoms of leukaemia are non-specific and of relatively low risk. This explains why many leukaemia diagnoses are unexpected findings.",['(c) British Journal of General Practice 2016.'],"['Shephard, Elizabeth A', 'Neal, Richard D', 'Rose, Peter W', 'Walter, Fiona M', 'Hamilton, Willie']","['Shephard EA', 'Neal RD', 'Rose PW', 'Walter FM', 'Hamilton W']","['University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter.', 'North Wales Centre for Primary Care Research, Bangor University, Wrexham.', 'Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford.', 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge.', 'University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Gen Pract,The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,9005323,,IM,"['Acute Disease/*mortality', 'Age Factors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', '*Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Review Literature as Topic', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC4758497,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'chronic leukaemia', 'diagnosis', 'primary health care']",2016/02/27 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/02/27 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['66/644/e182 [pii]', '10.3399/bjgp16X683989 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Gen Pract. 2016 Mar;66(644):e182-8. doi: 10.3399/bjgp16X683989.,,['RP-PG-0608-10045/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,['2017/03/01 00:00']

The primary genetic alteration in T-PLL are the inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) leading to TRD/TRA-TCL1A fusion, or the t(X;14)(q28;q11) associated with TRD/TRA-MTCP1 fusion. However, additional cooperating abnormalities are necessary for emergence of the full neoplastic phenotype. Though the pattern of secondary chromosomal aberrations is remarkably conserved, targets of the changes are largely unknown. We analysed a cohort of 43 well-characterized T-PLL for hotspot mutations in the genes JAK3, STAT5B and RHOA. Additionally, we selected a subset of 23 T-PLL cases for mutational screening of 54 genes known to be recurrently mutated in T-cell and other haematological neoplasms. Activating mutations in the investigated regions of the JAK3 and STAT5B genes were detected in 30% (13/43) and 21% (8/39) of the cases, respectively, and were mutually exclusive.

METHODS: Hospital discharge records contain a primary diagnosis field for principal disease and 5 secondary diagnosis fields for other diseases related or not to the principal diagnosis. In order to build patient indicators of HM-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), and leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], chronic lymphoid leukemia [CLL], acute myeloid leukemia [AML], and chronic myeloid leukemia [CML])-residents with first ICD-9-CM code 200-208 in any HDR field, or only in primary field, were identified. RESULTS: Among 3,955 patients with first diagnosis of HM registered in primary or secondary fields of HDR in the 2009-2013 period, and never recognized in 2005-2008 (791/year) (60.5/100,000), patients with first HM only in primary field were 2,304 (461/year) (35.2/100,000): 42% were NHL, 34% leukemia, 16% MM, 8% HL. Patient percentage of 461/791/year (58%) (64% among ordinary HDR and 49% in day-hospital HDR) was 35% for CLL (28/81), 47% for MM (74/152), 50% for CML (16/32), 57% for HL (36/63), 62% for NHL (194/314), and 82% for ALL (18/22) and AML (64/78). CONCLUSIONS: Applying the cancer registries national rate, expected new diagnoses of HM in Abruzzo are about 620/year (46.4/100,000), compared to HDR estimates of 461 and 791/year (primary/all diagnoses fields: 58%). Since this percentage varies between 35% and 82%, our findings on the 2 methods seem useful for a validation process in the starting Cancer Registry.",,"['Vitullo, Felice', 'Di Biagio, Katiuscia', 'Murgano, Adriano', 'Di Bartolomeo, Paolo']","['Vitullo F', 'Di Biagio K', 'Murgano A', 'Di Bartolomeo P']","['Department of Hematology, Transfusion Medicine and Biotechnology, ASL of Pescara, Regional Authority of Abruzzo, Pescara - Italy.', 'Environmental Epidemiological Unit, Regional Environmental Protection Agency of Marche, Ancona - Italy.', 'Health Information Systems Unit, Regional Authority of Abruzzo, Pescara - Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Transfusion Medicine and Biotechnology, ASL of Pescara, Regional Authority of Abruzzo, Pescara - Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160222,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Discharge']",,,,2016/02/27 06:00,2017/01/04 06:00,['2016/02/27 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['7ED61FD6-23BA-436D-8A78-C47818D478D6 [pii]', '10.5301/tj.5000472 [doi]']",ppublish,Tumori. 2016 Jun 2;2016(3):258-63. doi: 10.5301/tj.5000472.

We hypothesized that adult survivors of childhood malignant lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia would have impaired RV function. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined RV dimensions and function by echocardiography in 246 survivors, mean 21.7 years after diagnosis, and in 211 matched controls. Of the survivors, 84% had been exposed to anthracyclines, mediastinal radiotherapy, or both. Compared with controls, all mean measures of RV function were lower in the survivor group: fractional area change (44.5 vs. 48.6%, P < 0.001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (2.24 vs. 2.49 cm, P < 0.001), peak systolic tricuspid annular velocity (12.1 vs. 13.0 cm/s, P < 0.001), and free wall strain (-26.5 vs. -28.4%, P < 0.001). In contrast, there were little differences in RV diastolic dimensions. Lower measures of RV function were found in all survivor subgroups having received cardiotoxic treatment, but not in the 16% of survivors unexposed to anthracyclines or mediastinal radiotherapy. Signs of RV systolic dysfunction were found in 30% of the survivors, and more than 3 times more often in survivors with left ventricular dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Long-term survivors of childhood lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia frequently have impaired RV function compared with controls. As this is associated with increased risk of heart failure and death in many other conditions, we recommend increased attention to RV function in childhood survivors. Whether RV dysfunction impairs prognosis in this patient group should be examined in longitudinal studies.","['Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Derivatives of heterocyclic compounds are well known to have selective antiproliferative effect against many types of cancer. In this study, we investigated the ability of an indigenously synthesized anticancer molecule, G-11 [1-(2"",3"",4"",6""-Tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-4-(3'-trifluoromethylphenyl hydrazono)-3-trifluoromethyl-1,4-dihydropyrazol-5-one], to cause selective cytotoxicity and induce differentiation in the acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. G-11 was able to exert cytotoxic effect on hematological (Jurkat, U937, K562, HL-60, CCRF-SB) and solid tumor (MCF-7, HepG2, HeLa, Caco-2) cell lines, with IC50 values significantly lower than noncancerous cells (HEK-293, BJ and Vero) and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. G-11 induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages by inhibiting the activation of FLT3 (CD135 tyrosine kinase). ITD-FLT3 mutation found in many acute myeloid leukemia patients could also be targeted by G-11 as exhibited by its inhibitory effect on MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cell lines. Molecular docking studies suggest the involvement of Leu616, Asp698, Cys694 and Cys828 residues in binding of G-11 to FLT3.

The viability of the HL-60 cells was assessed using the MTT method, and the nuclear condensation indicative of apoptosis was observed by DAPI fluorescence staining. In addition, apoptotic signal proteins were examined using Western blotting. The results showed that apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation, increased significantly in SG-treated HL-60 cells. SG activated caspase-3 and caspase-9, and downregulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. SG also upregulated Bax and released cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, enabling apoptosis via the mitochondrially-mediated ""intrinsic"" pathway. Additionally, SG was able to cleave poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. These results suggest that SG might increase the effect of apoptosis on HL-60 cells through caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial-mediated pathways, and the MAPK pathway.",,"['Li, Zih-Ying', 'Huang, Wen-Chung', 'Tu, Rong-Syuan', 'Gu, Pei-Yu', 'Lin, Chwan-Fwu', 'Liou, Chian-Jiun']","['Li ZY', 'Huang WC', 'Tu RS', 'Gu PY', 'Lin CF', 'Liou CJ']","['* Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'dagger Graduate Institute of Health Industry Technology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'double dagger Research Center for Industry of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', '* Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', '* Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'section sign Department of Cosmetic Sciences, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'double dagger Research Center for Industry of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'paragraph sign Department of Nursing, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '97938-30-2 (vexibinol)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Flavanones/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Sophora/chemistry', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bax', 'Caspase-3', 'PARP-1', 'Sophoraflavanone G']",2016/02/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/27 06:00'],"['2016/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1142/S0192415X16500117 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2016;44(1):165-76. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X16500117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression and diagnostic utility of ZBTB16 in germ cell tumors. A total of 67 adult germ cell tumors were studied (62 testicular germ cell tumors, 2 ovarian yolk sac tumors, 1 mediastinal yolk sac tumor, and 2 retroperitoneal metastatic yolk sac tumors). The 62 testicular primary germ cell tumors are as follows: 34 pure germ cell tumors (20 seminomas, 8 embryonal carcinomas, 2 teratomas, 1 choriocarcinoma, 1 carcinoid, and 2 spermatocytic tumors) and 28 mixed germ cell tumors (composed of 13 embryonal carcinomas, 15 yolk sac tumors, 15 teratomas, 7 seminomas, and 3 choriocarcinomas in various combinations). Thirty-five cases contained germ cell neoplasia in situ. Yolk sac tumor was consistently reactive for ZBTB16. Among the 15 testicular yolk sac tumors in mixed germ cell tumors, all displayed moderate to diffuse ZBTB16 staining. ZBTB16 reactivity was present regardless of the histologic patterns of yolk sac tumor and ZBTB16 was able to pick up small foci of yolk sac tumor intermixed/embedded in other germ cell tumor subtype elements. Diffuse ZBTB16 immunoreactivity was also observed in 2/2 metastatic yolk sac tumors, 1/1 mediastinal yolk sac tumor, 2/2 ovarian yolk sac tumors, 2/2 spermatocytic tumors, 1/1 carcinoid, and the spermatogonial cells. All the other non-yolk sac germ cell tumors were nonreactive, including seminoma (n=27), embryonal carcinoma (n=21), teratoma (n=17), choriocarcinoma (n=4), and germ cell neoplasia in situ (n=35). The sensitivity and specificity of ZBTB16 in detecting yolk sac tumor among the germ cell tumors was 100% (20/20) and 96% (66/69), respectively.

We here report a cohort of 20 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with 8q24/MYC rearrangement, 3 detected at time of initial diagnosis and 17 acquired after a median interval of 48 months. At the time when 8q24/MYC arrangement was detected, 18 patients had B-symptoms, 17 had lymphadenopathy, and 17 had splenomegaly. Histologically, typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia morphology was seen in six patients, increased prolymphocytes in nine and Richter's transformation in five patients. Eighteen patients had karyotypic information available that showed t(8;v) in a complex karyotype in 12 patients and in a non-complex karyotype in 6 patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed MYC rearrangement in 17/17 patients. All patients required therapy after 8q24/MYC rearrangement was detected. At last follow-up, five of six patients with a non-complex karyotype were alive after a median of 74 months (10~143 months) from the detection of 8q24/MYC rearrangement. In contrast, 10 of 12 patients with a complex karyotype died with a median survival of 5.5 months. We conclude that 8q24/MYC rearrangement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is rare and often acquired during the course of disease.

Due to their ability to suppress effector cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been proposed as a cellular therapy to prevent GvHD, however they also inhibit the functions of natural killer (NK) cells, key effectors of the Graft versus Leukemia effect. In this study, we have explored whether a Tregs therapy will also impact on NK cell differentiation. Using an in vitro model of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation into NK cells, we found that activated Tregs led to a 90% reduction in NK cell numbers when added at the time of commitment to the NK cell lineage. This effect was contact dependent and was reversible upon Tregs depletion. The few NK cells that developed in these cultures were mature and exhibited normal functions. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of activated Tregs in rag(-/-) gammac(-/-) mice abrogated HSC differentiation into NK cells thus confirming our in vitro findings.

The pattern and distribution of diagnosed hematological cancers vary depending on age, sex, geography, and ethnicity suggesting the involvement of genetic and environmental factors for the development of these diseases. To our knowledge, there is no published report on HM in the case of Eastern Morocco. In this report we present for the first time the overall pattern of HM for this region. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with HM between January 2008 and December 2012 in three centres in Eastern Morocco providing cancer diagnosis, treatment or palliative care services. The FAB (French-American-British) classification system has been taken into account in the analysis of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 660 cases of HM were registered between January 2008 and December 2012. Overall, 6075 cases of cancers all sites combined were registered during this study period, indicating that HM account for around 10.9 % (660/6075) of all cancers recorded. Among the 660 registered cases of HM, 53 % were males and 47 % were females, with a male to female ratio of 1.1. Thus, overall, men are slightly more affected with HM than women. By contrast, a female predominance was observed in the case of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). HM occur at a relatively young age, with an overall median age at diagnosis of 54 years. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was the most common HM accounting for 29.7 % of all HM, followed by HL, MPN, multiple myelomas (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), AML, MDS, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). The majority of HM cases have been observed among patients aged 60 years and over (40.4 % of HM). Among this age group, NHL was the most common HM. In adolescents, HL was the most frequent HM. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided for the first time the pattern and distribution of HM in Eastern Morocco. Our findings justify the need to establish a regional cancer registry as a first step in blood cancer control in Eastern Morocco.",,"['Elidrissi Errahhali, Mounia', 'Elidrissi Errahhali, Manal', 'Boulouiz, Redouane', 'Ouarzane, Meryem', 'Bellaoui, Mohammed']","['Elidrissi Errahhali M', 'Elidrissi Errahhali M', 'Boulouiz R', 'Ouarzane M', 'Bellaoui M']","['Medical Biology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Oujda, University Mohammed the First, Oujda, Morocco. mounyadrissi@hotmail.com.', 'Medical Biology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Oujda, University Mohammed the First, Oujda, Morocco. manaldrissi@hotmail.fr.', 'Medical Biology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Oujda, University Mohammed the First, Oujda, Morocco. rboulouiz@gmail.com.', 'Medical Biology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Oujda, University Mohammed the First, Oujda, Morocco. mouarzane@hotmail.com.', 'Medical Biology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Oujda, University Mohammed the First, Oujda, Morocco. bmbellaoui@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160225,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morocco/epidemiology', '*Population Surveillance', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC4768409,,,2016/02/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2205-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2205-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Feb 25;16:159. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2205-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work, a conserved haematopoietic transcription factor Tal-1/Scl (Stem Cell Leukemia) was identified in Pacific oyster (Cg-SCL), and it was evolutionarily close to the orthologs in deuterostomes. Cg-SCL was highly distributed in the hemocytes as well as gill and mantle. The hemocyte specific genes Integrin, EcSOD and haematopoietic transcription factors GATA3, C-Myb, c-kit, were down-regulated when Cg-SCL was interfered by dsRNA. During the larval developmental stages, the mRNA transcripts of Cg-SCL gradually increased after fertilization and peaked at early trochophore larvae stage (10 hpf, hours post fertilization), then sharply decreased in late trochophore larvae stage (15 hpf) before resuming in umbo larvae (120 hpf). Whole-mount immunofluorescence assay further revealed that the immunoreactivity of Cg-SCL appeared in blastula larvae with two approximate symmetric spots, and this expression pattern lasted in gastrula larvae. By trochophore, the immunoreactivity formed a ring around the dorsal region and then separated into two remarkable spots at the dorsal side in D-veliger larvae. After bacterial challenge, the mRNA expression levels of Cg-SCL were significantly up-regulated in the D-veliger and umbo larvae, indicating the available hematopoietic regulation in oyster larvae. These results demonstrated that Cg-SCL could be used as haematopoietic specific marker to trace potential developmental events of hematopoiesis during ontogenesis of oyster, which occurred early in blastula stage and maintained until D-veliger larvae.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to the most abundant cell type of the CNS, the astrocytes, various stem cells and progenitor cells also contain GFAP+ populations. Here, in order to distinguish between two types of GFAP expressing cells with or without the expression of the A2B5 antigens, we performed lipidomic analyses on A2B5+/GFAP+ and A2B5-/GFAP+ cells from rat spinal cord. First, A2B5+/GFAP- progenitors were exposed to the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) to induce their differentiation to A2B5+/GFAP+ cells or A2B5-/GFAP+ astrocytes, respectively. The cells were then analyzed for changes in their phospholipid, sphingolipid or acyl chain profiles by mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. Compared to A2B5+/GFAP- progenitors, A2B5-/GFAP+ astrocytes contained higher amounts of ether phospholipids (especially the species containing arachidonic acid) and sphingomyelin, which may indicate characteristics of cellular differentiation and inability for multipotency. In comparison, principal component analyses revealed that the lipid composition of A2B5+/GFAP+ cells retained many of the characteristics of A2B5+/GFAP- progenitors, but their lipid profile was different from that of A2B5-/GFAP+ astrocytes. Thus, our study demonstrated that two GFAP+ cell populations have distinct lipid profiles with the A2B5+/GFAP+ cells sharing a phospholipid profile with progenitors rather than astrocytes. The progenitor cells may require regulated low levels of lipids known to mediate signaling functions in differentiated cells, and the precursor lipid profiles may serve as one measure of the differentiation capacity of a cell population.",,"['Itokazu, Yutaka', 'Tajima, Nobuyoshi', 'Kerosuo, Laura', 'Somerharju, Pentti', 'Sariola, Hannu', 'Yu, Robert K', 'Kakela, Reijo']","['Itokazu Y', 'Tajima N', 'Kerosuo L', 'Somerharju P', 'Sariola H', 'Yu RK', 'Kakela R']","['Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Biocenter 3, P.O.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within the 'German Registry of Disorders on Eosinophils and Mast Cells', we identified 65 patients with SM who had two consecutive BM biopsies. The first biopsy was evaluated by a local pathologist (LP) and the second biopsy by a reference pathologist (RP) of the 'European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM)'. RESULTS: Final diagnoses by RP were SM (n = 27), SM or aggressive SM (ASM) with associated clonal haematological non-mast cell lineage disease [(A)SM-AHNMD, n = 34)] or mast cell leukaemia +/- AHNMD (n = 4). In 15 of 65 patients (23%), initial diagnoses by LP were incorrect (by overlooking SM), for example primary myelofibrosis (n = 3), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassified (n = 3) or B-cell lymphoma (n = 2). Fourteen of 15 patients (93%) with incorrect diagnosis had an advanced SM, mostly (A)SM-AHNMD. In the 50 concordantly diagnosed patients, immunohistochemical markers for quantitative assessment of mast cell infiltration, for example CD117 (KIT) or CD25, were applied by LP in only 34 of 50 patients (68%), and mutational analysis for KIT D816V was performed or recommended in only 13 of 50 patients (26%). Finally, the subclassification of SM was discordant because LP did not diagnose AHNMD in nine of 50 (18%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, adequate diagnosis and subclassification of SM requires an in-depth evaluation of the BM by experienced haematopathologists (preferably in a reference centre) in combination with molecular genetics, serum tryptase level and clinical parameters.","['(c) 2016 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal', 'Foundation.']","['Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Schwaab, Juliana', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Naumann, Nicole', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Valent, Peter', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Metzgeroth, Georgia', 'Reiter, Andreas']","['Jawhar M', 'Schwaab J', 'Horny HP', 'Sotlar K', 'Naumann N', 'Fabarius A', 'Valent P', 'Cross NC', 'Hofmann WK', 'Metzgeroth G', 'Reiter A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160321,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Diagnostic Errors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis', 'Pathology, Clinical/*organization & administration/standards', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow histology', 'European Competence Network on Mastocytosis', 'misdiagnosis', 'systemic mastocytosis']",2016/02/26 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/eci.12607 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2016 May;46(5):392-7. doi: 10.1111/eci.12607.

Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), a key hub in histone lysine methyltransferases, has been reported to play an important role in the processes of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemias and validated to be a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we identified a novel DOT1L inhibitor, DC_L115 (CAS no. 1163729-79-0), by combining structure-based virtual screening with biochemical analyses. This potent inhibitor DC_L115 shows high inhibitory activity toward DOT1L (IC50 = 1.5 muM). Through a process of surface plasmon resonance-based binding assays, DC_L115 was founded to bind to DOT1L with a binding affinity of 0.6 muM in vitro. Moreover, this compound selectively inhibits MLL-rearranged cell proliferation with an IC50 value of 37.1 muM. We further predicted the binding modes of DC_L115 through molecular docking analysis and found that the inhibitor competitively occupies the binding site of S-adenosylmethionine.

This combination therapy of remission induction with ALL maintenance therapy and 5-azacitidine and consolidation with reduced toxicity haploidentical HSCT is novel and promising for patients who lack conventional donors and are not candidates for myeloablative therapy.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Polishchuk, Veronika', 'Khazal, Sajad', 'Berulava, Giorgi', 'Roth, Michael', 'Mahadeo, Kris M']","['Polishchuk V', 'Khazal S', 'Berulava G', 'Roth M', 'Mahadeo KM']","[""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Marrow and Blood Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York."", 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Marrow and Blood Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York."", 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Marrow and Blood Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York."", 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Marrow and Blood Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York."", 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160223,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BMT', 'chemotherapy', 'leukemia']",2016/02/26 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25948 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jun;63(6):1111-2. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25948.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of co-treatment with an additional Bcl-xL inhibitor, Z36. Treatment with Z36 induced cell death in leukemia cell lines, with MT-4 cells exhibiting the lowest sensitivity to Z36. Co-treatment of cells with Z36 and CuD resulted in a greater degree of cell death for Hut78 and Jurkat cells than treatment with CuD alone. In contrast, co-treatment of MT-4 cells with Z36 and CuD had a suppressive effect on cell death. The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) suppressed the growth of leukemia cell lines HuT78, Jurkat, MT-1, and MT-4. CuD-induced cell death was enhanced by 3-MA in Jurkat cells, but inhibited in MT-4 cells. Western blotting results revealed cleavage of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), supporting CuD-induced cell death; 3-MA enhanced CuD-Z36-induced PARP cleavage.

PROCEDURE: We examined OS, event-free survival (EFS) and cumulative incidence (CI) and timing of relapse by community-level poverty for 575 children aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated on consecutive phase III multicenter Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocols between 2000 and 2010. Children were categorized into high- and low-poverty areas for the analysis using aggregate U.S. Census data linked to zip code. RESULTS: Children living in high-poverty areas experienced a 5-year OS of 85% as compared with 92% for those in low-poverty areas (P = 0.02); poverty remained marginally significant (P = 0.07) after adjustment for immunophenotype, age, and white blood cell count. There were no differences detected in EFS or CI relapse by poverty area. However, 92% of the relapses observed in children from high-poverty areas occurred <36 months from complete remission, compared to 48% of those in children from low-poverty areas (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: U.S. children with ALL living in high-poverty areas have a higher risk of early relapse when compared with those living in low-poverty areas despite uniform treatment. This may in part explain decreased OS observed in these children. This finding highlights disparities in childhood cancer outcomes by SES despite uniform treatment. Further investigations of the mechanistic pathways underlying this finding are needed.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Bona, Kira', 'Blonquist, Traci M', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Wolfe, Joanne']","['Bona K', 'Blonquist TM', 'Neuberg DS', 'Silverman LB', 'Wolfe J']","[""Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Population Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Population Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160223,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*economics/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Socioeconomic Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'disparities', 'poverty', 'socioeconomic status']",2016/02/26 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25928 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jun;63(6):1012-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25928.

Thirty-four patients with R/R CLL/SLL who had received 1-5 prior chemotherapy regimens were treated with 6 cycles of BR induction. Patients achieving at least a minor response received twelve 28-d cycles of lenalidomide 5-10 mg/d. The primary endpoint was PFS. The median age was 67 years, with a median of 2 prior therapies. Eleven patients had confirmed presence of 17p and/or 11q deletions. Twenty-five (74%) completed 6 cycles of induction BR (response rate 56%).

The impact of BM aspiration delay on measured MRD levels and resulting risk stratification is currently unknown. We analysed paired MRD data of 289 paediatric ALL patients requiring a repeat BM aspiration. MRD levels differed in 108 patients (37%) with a decrease in the majority (85/108). This would have resulted in different risk group allocation in 64 of 289 patients (23%) when applying the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 2000 criteria. MRD change was associated with the duration of delay; 40% of patients with delay >/=7 days had a shift to lower MRD levels compared to only 18% after a shorter delay. Patients MRD-positive at the original but MRD-negative at the repeat BM aspiration (n = 50) had a worse 5-year event-free survival than those already negative at first aspiration (n = 115) (86 +/- 5% vs. 94 +/- 2%; P = 0.024).

Although most patients with LCH have localized disease, requiring local or even no therapy, those patients with disseminated, 'multi-system' disease require specific therapy because they may be at risk for morbidity or even mortality. The current standard of care has developed empirically, based mainly on the experience of treating children with leukaemia and other haemo-proliferative disorders. At the time of writing, the combined use of vinblastine and prednisone remains the standard of care for children with multi-system LCH. The combination of cytarabine and cladribine is the current standard for second-line therapy of refractory cases with vital organ dysfunction. Recent advances in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of LCH may support a change in treatment strategy. Evidence of mutations that aberrantly activate RAF/MEK/ERK signalling in over two thirds of patients with LCH may direct a target therapy strategy. Vemurafenib, a small molecule widely used in the treatment of melanoma, is the main candidate for testing in prospective trials for patients with evidence of BRAF(V) (600E) mutation on lesional tissue. Additional molecules, including the recently approved trametinib, could follow. Identification of mutations in other genes in the remaining multisystem LCH cases could contribute to define a scenario in which target therapy becomes the main therapeutic choice in this intriguing disorder. However, because the long-term risks and benefits of these agents in children are unknown, and other effective treatments exist for many LCH patients, the optimal indications for administering a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to children is an open question.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Arico, Maurizio']",['Arico M'],"['Azienda Sanitaria Regionale, Ragusa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160223,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Mutation', '*Point-of-Care Systems', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MAP2K1', '*RAF', '*histiocytosis', '*vemurafenib']",2016/02/26 06:00,2017/05/04 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13955 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Jun;173(5):663-70. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13955.

METHODS: Experiments were divided into 4 groups: control group, in which the cells were treated with complete medium (alpha-MEM containing 10% FBS); group LIF, in which the cells were treated with complete medium containing 10 ng/ml LIF; group bFGF, in which the cells were treated with complete medium containing 10 ng/ml bFGF; combination group, in which the cells were treated with complete medium containing 10 ng/ml LIF and 10 ng/ml bFGF. The growth curves of hUC-MSC at passage 4 in different groups were assayed by cell counting kit 8. Cellular morphologic changes were observed under inverted phase contrast microscope; hUC-MSC senescence in different groups was detected by beta-galactosidase staining. The expression of PCNA, P16, P21, P53, OCT4 and NANOG genes was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The cell growth curves of each group were similar to the S-shape; the cell proliferation rate from high to low as follows: that in the combination group > group bFGF > group LIF > control group. Senescence and declining of proliferation were observed at hUC-MSC very early in control group; the cells in group LIF maintained good cellular morphology at early stage, but cell proliferation was slow and late senescence was observed; a few cells in group bFGF presented signs of senescence, but with quick proliferation; the cells in combination group grew quickly and maintained cellular morphology of hUC-MSC for long time. The LIF and bFGF up-regulated the expression of PCNA, OCT4 and NANOG, while they down-regulated the expression of P16, P21, P53, and their combinative effects were more significant. CONCLUSION: LIF combined with bFGF not only can promote the proliferation and maintenance of stemness of hUC-MSC, but also can delay the senescence of hUC-MSC.",,"['Hu, Wen-Long', 'Wu, Ping-Ping', 'Yin, Chang-Chang', 'Shi, Jian-Ming', 'Yin, Ming']","['Hu WL', 'Wu PP', 'Yin CC', 'Shi JM', 'Yin M']","['Medicine Graduate School, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Basic Medical College, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang 332000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Medicine Graduate School, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Basic Medical College, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang 332000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Medicine Graduate School, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.

METHODS: The clinical data of 43 patients with newly-diagnosed childhood B-NHL/B-ALL from July 2005 to December 2013 in West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University were retrospectively analyzed with particular focus on clinical presentations, laboratory findings and histology. Among them 26 patients received B-NHL-2010 protocol and 17 patients received LMB-89 protocol treatment. Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the survival rates between groups, while multiple factor logistic regression was used to identify the prognostic factors. RESULTS: (1) The median age at diagnosis was 7.58 (2.42-13.67) years. The male-to-female ratio was 2.9 : 1. No significant difference was found in the median age at diagnosis between male and female children with B-NHL/B-ALL (P = 0.837). (2) Burkitt's lymphoma was the most common (34/43, 79.07%), followed by diffuse large B cell lymphoma (4/43, 9.3%), ALL-L3 (3/43, 6.98%) and others (2/43, 4.65%) in decreasing frequency. (3) According to St. Jude staging classification, 4 patients (9.30%) were divided into stage I, 9 patients (20.93%) into stage II, 23 patients (53.49%) into stage III and 7 patients (16.28%) into stage IV; (4) Clinically, the common predilection sites were as following: ileocecus (11/43, 25.58%), nasopharynx (10/43, 23.26%), faciomaxillary (9/43, 20.93%), superficial lymphadenopathy (8/43, 18.60%), other sites such as mediastinum and bone marrow (5/43, 11.63%). (5) With a median follow up of 24 months (0.7-105 months), the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate and event-free survival (EFS) rate were 79.8% +/- 6.5%% and 71.0% +/- 7.2%, respectively. The 2-year OS and EFS rates in patients treated with B-NHL-2010 protocol were 79.1% +/- 8.4% and 74.1% +/- 8.4%, while those in patients treated with LMB-89 protocol were 87.5% +/- 8.3% and 66.7% +/- 12.4%, respectively, but there was no significant difference between them (P > 0.05). The 2-year EFS rate in patients with LDH > 2N and bone marrow infiltration were significantly lower than that of other groups (P < 0.05). (6) 8 patients (18.6%) relapsed. The median relapsed time was 6 months (2-9 months). 1 patient suffered progressive disease. Male, systemic symptom, elevated LDH, bone marrow and CNS infiltration and advanced stage (stage III and stage IV) were associated with relapse /progressive disease. Logistic regression analysis showed that LDH > 2N was an independent unfavorable prognostic factors (OR = 31.129, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Outcome of B-NHL/B-ALL is greatly improved by current intensive and short-time chemotherapy regimen. The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate is 71.0% +/- 7.2%. There is no significant difference in EFS rate between patients treated with B-NHL-2010 protocol and LMB89 protocol.

METHODS: The clinical features of 153 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) received L-ASP or PEG-ASP in our hospital from January 2010 to January 2015 year were analyzed retrospectively. Among 153 patients, 108 patients received L-ASP treatment and 45 patients received PEG-ASP treatment. The change of coagulation function and the incidence of complications of 2 treated groups were compared, and the influence of differenent using time of L-ASP on above mentioned factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The age, sex, white blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis, subtype and risk factors of disease, total effective rate and complication rates showed no significant difference in the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The total infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen (FIB) also showed no significant difference (P = 0.12, 0.65, 0.09). FIB levels decreased slower after treatment of PEG-ASP (9.49 vs 6.90) (P = 0.000) than that after treatment of L-ASP. When L-ASP used at interval, FIB level decreased slower than that of continuous use. However, the risk of bleeding is higher when used at interval early (P = 0.01, 0.013). CONCLUSION: Using PEG-ASP can better monitor the coagulation function than L-ASP. L-ASP used at interval can monitor the coagulation function easily, but its early use may cause an increased incidence of complications.",,"['Xu, Lin-Wei', 'Wei, Xiao-Lei', 'Wei, Yong-Qiang', 'Hao, Xiao-Xiao', 'Zhou, Qin-Jun', 'Feng, Ru']","['Xu LW', 'Wei XL', 'Wei YQ', 'Hao XX', 'Zhou QJ', 'Feng R']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong Province, China.

METHODS: The 38 patients with median age 40.5 (range 13-69) were treated with FLAG regimen from July 2006 to July 2013 in hospital. According to disease status, all the patiens were divided into 4 different groups: early relapse group (3 patients), late relapse group (12 patients), first induction failure group (16 patients) and second induction failure group (7 patients); meanwhile, based on risk status, all above-mentioned patients were stratified into better (8 patients), intermediate (26 patients) and poor (4 patients) groups, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty two cases achieved complete remission, 5 cases achieved partial remission among 38 patients. The complete remission (CR) rate was 57.9% and the overall response (OR) rate was 71.7%. The CR rate was higher in first induction failure group (12/16, 75%) than that in second induction failure group (3/7, 42.9%) and late relapse group (6/12, 50%). In better group and intermediate group, the CR rates (5/8, 62.5%; 16/26, 61.5%) were higher than that in poor group (1/4, 25%). The risk status was associated with the CR rate (P = 0.03) [OR = 25.9(95% CI 1.2-545.4)]. The intermediate risk was favorable factor to CR. Out of 22 patients with CR, 12 patients received allogenetic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and 10 patients received large dose of cytarabine or other regimens as consolidation treatments, 6 patients who accepted allo-HSCT are still alive. The overall survival (OS) was 25 months. The univariate analyses showed that the response to FLAG was accociated with OS [HR = 0.246, CR vs NR (95% CI 0.07-0.79) P = 0.03]. The 2-year cumulative survial rates in CR group and PR group were 62% and 48%, respectively. The 18- month cumulative survival rate was 73% in better group, 52% in intermediate group, 36% in poor group (P = 0.17); and 65% in first induction failure group and 32% in second induction failure group (P = 0.19).

METHODS: Clinical data of 44 AYA ALL patients admitted in our hospital from September 1997 to April 2014 were analyzed retrospectively and the impact of treatment on overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) were investigated. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at diagnosis was 23.7 (15-37) years and the male/female was 2.38:1. Out of them 88.6% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) after 1 course of induction chemotherapy, 35 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and 6 patients received chemotherapy, 3 patients received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) as consolidation therapy in CR1. The expected 3-year OS and EFS rates of all the 44 patients were 64.3% and 61.7% respectively. The expected 5-year OS and EFS rates were 55.4% and 56.6% respectively. Allo-HSCT was not superior to chemotherapy and auto-HSCT in all the 44 patients (P = 0.308 for OS and P = 0.291 for EFS). In allo-HSCT group, the treatment related mortality was 22.9%, and the differences of OS and EFS in standard risk and poor risk AYA ALL patients were no significant (P = 0.775 for OS and P = 0.817 for EFS). However, compared with chemotherapy and auto-HSCT, allo-HSCT could significantly improve the OS and EFS in standard risk AYA ALL (P = 0.0296 for OS and P = 0.0359 for EFS).

CONCLUSION: The emodin derivative E19 can efficiently inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of K562 cells and K562/G01 cells, while the inhibition of phosphorylation of P210 protein and down-regulation of P210 protein expression may be involved in these processes.",,"['Li, Bo-Jun', 'Liu, Ting-Bo', 'Wang, Wen-Feng', 'Lin, Min-Hui', 'Hu, Jian-Da']","['Li BJ', 'Liu TB', 'Wang WF', 'Lin MH', 'Hu JD']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital, Affiliated to Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan 442000, Hubei Province, China."", 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.

We identified Medicare enrollees diagnosed with MDS between 2006 and 2011, and analysed linked claims for performance on two widely-accepted quality measures: diagnostic bone marrow cytogenetic testing (diagnostic quality) and pre-treatment iron assessment for patients receiving an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA; treatment quality). A total of 4575 patients met the criteria for diagnostic quality measurement, and 3379 for treatment quality measurement. In the diagnostic cohort, 74% had a claim for marrow cytogenetic testing 3 months before to 3 months after diagnosis. In multivariate models, younger age (P < 0.001), treatment at a higher-volume MDS centre (P < 0.001), and claims for pancytopenia (P < 0.001) were all associated with higher levels of testing. A borderline result was observed for diagnostic year, with improvement over time (P = 0.06). In the treatment cohort, 56% had evidence of pre-ESA iron assessment, with higher rates for later years of diagnosis (P < 0.001), higher household income (P = 0.03), and those treated at higher-volume centres (P = 0.01). In this large cohort of patients with MDS, quality of care was suboptimal overall, but worse in several specific subgroups.

To activate silenced genes, repressive chromatin marks are removed and active marks must be acquired. Histone H3 lysine-4 (H3K4) demethylases are key chromatin modifiers that establish the repressive chromatin state at Notch target genes. However, the counteracting histone methyltransferase required for the active chromatin state remained elusive. Here, we show that the RBP-J interacting factor SHARP is not only able to interact with the NCoR corepressor complex, but also with the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2D coactivator complex. KMT2D and NCoR compete for the C-terminal SPOC-domain of SHARP. We reveal that the SPOC-domain exclusively binds to phosphorylated NCoR. The balance between NCoR and KMT2D binding is shifted upon mutating the phosphorylation sites of NCoR or upon inhibition of the NCoR kinase CK2beta. Furthermore, we show that the homologs of SHARP and KMT2D in Drosophila also physically interact and control Notch-mediated functions in vivo Together, our findings reveal how signaling can fine-tune a committed chromatin state by phosphorylation of a pivotal chromatin-modifier.","['(c) The Author(s) 2016.

We have shown that a tandem fusion of two designed binding proteins, termed monobodies, directed to the interaction interface between the Src homology 2 (SH2) and kinase domains and to the phosphotyrosine-binding site of the SH2 domain, respectively, inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Because the latter monobody inhibits processive phosphorylation by Bcr-Abl and the SH2-kinase interface is occluded in the active kinase, it remained undetermined whether targeting the SH2-kinase interface alone was sufficient for Bcr-Abl inhibition. To address this question, we generated new, higher affinity monobodies with single nanomolar KD values targeting the kinase-binding surface of SH2. Structural and mutagenesis studies revealed the molecular underpinnings of the monobody-SH2 interactions. Importantly, the new monobodies inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity in vitro and in cells, and they potently induced cell death in chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines. This work provides strong evidence for the SH2-kinase interface as a pharmacologically tractable site for allosteric inhibition of Bcr-Abl.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Wojcik, John', 'Lamontanara, Allan Joaquim', 'Grabe, Grzegorz', 'Koide, Akiko', 'Akin, Louesa', 'Gerig, Barbara', 'Hantschel, Oliver', 'Koide, Shohei']","['Wojcik J', 'Lamontanara AJ', 'Grabe G', 'Koide A', 'Akin L', 'Gerig B', 'Hantschel O', 'Koide S']","['From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637.', 'Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, School of Life Sciences, Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland, and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637.', 'Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, School of Life Sciences, Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland, and.', 'Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, School of Life Sciences, Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland, and oliver.hantschel@epfl.ch.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, Shohei.Koide@nyumc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160224,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*chemistry/immunology/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'src Homology Domains']",PMC4861451,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL tyrosine kinase', 'FN3', 'PPI inhibitor', 'Src homology 2 domain (SH2 domain)', 'enzyme inhibitor', 'protein engineering', 'protein-protein interaction', 'x-ray crystallography']",2016/02/26 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)41181-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.707901 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Apr 15;291(16):8836-47. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.707901.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CLL who survived >10 years were defined as LTSs of CLL. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to compare the incidence of OC in LTS of CLL versus the general population. A multivariable model was used to identify independent predictors of OC. Overall survival was analyzed as a function of the presence of OC. RESULTS: Among 797 LTSs of CLL, the cumulative frequency of OC was 36%, similar between 570 patients (72%) who required treatment for CLL (TRT) and 227 (28%) who remained untreated (UT). The most common OC in both groups was non-melanoma skin cancer, followed by prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and leukemia in TRT patients, and by prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and gastrointestinal tumors in the UT group. The SIR for all OC was 1.2 (P = 0.034). It was higher in males (SIR 1.31; P = 0.013) and patients <60 years (SIR 1.27; P = 0.027). A higher SIR was shown for secondary leukemia, melanoma, and head-and-neck cancers, whereas a lower SIR was found for gastrointestinal and bladder cancers. Independent predictors of OC development were advanced age, male gender, and lower platelets. The survival of patients with OC was 16.2 months and that of patients without OC 22.9 years. CONCLUSIONS: LTSs of CLL have an increased incidence of OC compared with the general population. CLL therapy is not a risk factor for OC in LTSs of CLL. The presence of an OC in these patients may be associated with shorter survival.","['(c) The Author 2016.

However, its potential role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is still unknown. The ZFX expression was significantly increased in CML patients and cell lines. Based on loss-of-function experiments in CML cells, we found that knockdown of ZFX expression impaired cell proliferation and induced mitotic arrest in G0/G1 stage and apoptosis. In addition, ZFX silencing sensitized CML cells to imatinib treatment.

Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib mesylate (IM), revolutionized CML therapy. Nevertheless, about 20 % of CMLs display primary or acquired TKI resistance. TKI resistance can be either caused by mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain or by aberrant signaling by its effectors, e.g. Lyn or Gab2. Bcr-Abl mutations are frequently observed in TKI resistance and can only in some cases be overcome by second line TKIs. In addition, we have previously shown that the formation of Gab2 complexes can be regulated by Bcr-Abl and that Gab2 signaling counteracts the efficacy of four distinct Bcr-Abl inhibitors. Therefore, TKI resistance still represents a challenge for disease management and alternative therapies are urgently needed. FINDINGS: Using different CML cell lines and models, we identified the clinically approved TKIs sorafenib (SF) and axitinib (AX) as drugs overcoming the resistance mediated by the Bcr Abl(T315I) mutant as well as the one mediated by Gab2 and Lyn(Y508F). In addition, we demonstrated that AX mainly affects the Bcr-Abl/Grb2/Gab2 axis, whereas SF seems to act independently of the fusion kinase and most likely by blocking signaling pathways up- and downstream of Gab2. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that SF and AX show potency in various and mechanistically distinct scenarios of TKI resistance, including Bcr-Abl(T315I) as well as Lyn- and Gab2-mediated resistances. Our data invites for further evaluation und consideration of these inhibitors in the treatment of TKI resistant CML.",,"['Halbach, Sebastian', 'Hu, Zehan', 'Gretzmeier, Christine', 'Ellermann, Julia', 'Wohrle, Franziska U', 'Dengjel, Jorn', 'Brummer, Tilman']","['Halbach S', 'Hu Z', 'Gretzmeier C', 'Ellermann J', 'Wohrle FU', 'Dengjel J', 'Brummer T']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research (IMMZ), Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.

Mice engineered with these mutations provide a foundation for understanding leukemogenesis and identifying therapies. However, data from whole genome studies provide evidence that malignancies are characterized by multiple genetic alterations that vary between patients, as well as inherited genetic variation that can also contribute to oncogenesis. Improved outcomes will require precision medicine approaches-targeted therapies tailored to malignancies in each patient. Preclinical models that reflect the range of mutations and the genetic background present in patient populations are required to develop and test the combinations of therapies that will be used to provide precision medicine therapeutic strategies. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) produced by transplanting leukemia cells from patients into immune deficient mice provide preclinical models where disease mechanisms and therapeutic efficacy can be studied in vivo in context of the genetic variability present in patient tumors. PDX models are possible because many elements in the bone marrow microenvironment show cross-species activity between mice and humans. However, several cytokines likely to impact leukemia cells are species-specific with limited activity on transplanted human leukemia cells. In this review we discuss the importance of PDX models for developing precision medicine approaches to leukemia treatment. We illustrate how PDX models can be optimized to overcome a lack of cross-species cytokine activity by reviewing a recent strategy developed for use with a high-risk form of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that is characterized by overexpression of CRLF2, a receptor component for the cytokine, TSLP.",['Copyright (c) 2016 American Federation for Medical Research.'],"['Francis, Olivia L', 'Milford, Terry-Ann M', 'Beldiman, Cornelia', 'Payne, Kimberly J']","['Francis OL', 'Milford TA', 'Beldiman C', 'Payne KJ']","['Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, California, USA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, California, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, California, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20160212,England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', '*Precision Medicine', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5154753,['NOTNLM'],"['Animal', 'Cytokines', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoid', 'Models']",2016/02/26 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jim-2016-000076 [pii]', '10.1136/jim-2016-000076 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 2016 Mar;64(3):740-4. doi: 10.1136/jim-2016-000076.

Discerning the function of these processes is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of leukemia and for developing the targeted therapies. Here, we provide an overview of one of the mechanisms that regulates gene transcription in leukemia. This mechanism involves the direct interaction between Casein Kinase II (CK2) and the Ikaros transcription factor. Ikaros (IKZF1) functions as a master regulator of hematopoiesis and a tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Impaired Ikaros function results in the development of high-risk leukemia. Ikaros binds to the upstream regulatory elements of its target genes and regulates their transcription via chromatin remodeling. In vivo, Ikaros is a target for CK2, a pro-oncogenic kinase. CK2 directly phosphorylates Ikaros at multiple amino acids. Functional experiments showed that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ikaros, regulates Ikaros' DNA binding affinity, subcellular localization and protein stability. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation of Ikaros by CK2 regulates Ikaros binding and repression of the terminal deoxytransferase (TdT) gene in normal thymocytes and in T-cell ALL. Available data suggest that the oncogenic activity of CK2 in leukemia involves functional inactivation of Ikaros and provide a rationale for CK2 inhibitors as a potential treatment for ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 American Federation for Medical Research.'],"['Gowda, Chandrika S', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ding, Yali', 'Kapadia, Malika', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Gowda CS', 'Song C', 'Ding Y', 'Kapadia M', 'Dovat S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20160209,England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,"['148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Casein Kinase II/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Signal Transduction']",2016/02/26 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jim-2016-000075 [pii]', '10.1136/jim-2016-000075 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 2016 Mar;64(3):735-9. doi: 10.1136/jim-2016-000075.

Objective Very little is known about the potential efficacy of combination of these two agents to potentiate TNF-induced apoptosis in human chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). Materials and methods In the present study, we investigated whether SV combined with BGM mediates its effect through suppression of NF-kappaB-signalling pathway. Results We found that the combination treatment enhanced cytotoxicity and potentiated the apoptosis induced by TNF as indicated by intracellular esterase activity, Annexin V staining and caspase activation. This effect of co-treatment correlated with down-regulation of various gene products that mediate cell proliferation (cyclin D1), cell survival (cIAP-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Survivin), invasion (MMP-9) and angiogenesis (VEGF); all known to be regulated by NF-kappaB. SV combined with BGM also produced TNF-induced cell-cycle arrest in S-phase and this arrest correlated with a concomitant increase in the levels of cyclin-dependent inhibitor p21 and p27. The combination therapy inhibited TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, IkappaBalpha degradation and p65 translocation to the nucleus as compared with the treatment with individual agents alone. Besides, SV combined with BGM did not significantly potentiate apoptotic effect induced by TNF in p65(-)(/)(-) cells, as compared with wild-type fibroblasts.

Through high-density imputation and conditional analyses, we identified seven distinct association signals at these four loci, each with allelic effects on T2D susceptibility that were homogenous across ancestry groups. By leveraging differences in the structure of linkage disequilibrium between diverse populations, and increased sample size, we localised the variants most likely to drive each distinct association signal. We demonstrated that integration of these genetic fine-mapping data with genomic annotation can highlight potential causal regulatory elements in T2D-relevant tissues. These analyses provide insight into the mechanisms through which T2D association signals are mediated, and suggest future routes to understanding the biology of specific disease susceptibility loci.",['(c) The Author 2016.

This study thus aimed to investigate the relationship between SUA and prehypertension in subjects with different glycemic status, including NGT, pre-diabetes and diabetes. A total of 12 010 participants were included after excluding subjects with blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, history of hypertension, leukaemia, lymphoma, hypothyroidism, medication for hypertension and hyperuricemia and missing data. Subjects were divided into four groups based on SUA quartiles (male Q1: 345.0, Q2: 345.0-392.6, Q3: 392.6-440.2, Q4: 440.2 mumol l(-1) and female Q1: 249.8, Q2: 249.8-285.5, Q3: 285.5-333.1, Q4: 333.1 mumol l(-1)). Diabetes, pre-diabetes and NGT were assessed according to the 2010 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. Normotension and prehypertension were defined according to the JNC-7 (The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) criteria. The SUA was significantly higher in prehypertensive subjects as compared with normotensive subjects. SUA, as a continuous variable, was positively associated with prehypertension in subjects with NGT but not pre-diabetes and diabetes. Besides, NGT subjects with the highest quartile of SUA exhibited a higher risk of prehypertension after adjustment for other confounding factors. In pre-diabetes and diabetes groups, none of SUA quartiles was significantly related to prehypertension. SUA was significantly associated with an increased risk of prehypertension in subjects with NGT but insignificantly in subjects with pre-diabetes and diabetes.",,"['Wu, I-H', 'Wu, J-S', 'Sun, Z-J', 'Lu, F-H', 'Chang, C-S', 'Chang, C-J', 'Yang, Y-C']","['Wu IH', 'Wu JS', 'Sun ZJ', 'Lu FH', 'Chang CS', 'Chang CJ', 'Yang YC']","['Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Dou-Liou Branch, Yunlin, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Tainan Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160225,England,J Hum Hypertens,Journal of human hypertension,8811625,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Glucose/*analysis', '*Blood Pressure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*blood/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/*blood/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prediabetic State/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prehypertension/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Uric Acid/*blood']",,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2018/01/24 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jhh20164 [pii]', '10.1038/jhh.2016.4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hum Hypertens. 2016 Aug;30(8):479-82. doi: 10.1038/jhh.2016.4.

There is no effective therapy or vaccine; thus, the diagnosis and elimination of BLV-infected cattle are the most effective method to eradicate the infection. Clinical veterinarians need a simpler and more rapid method of diagnosing infection, because both nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR are labor intensive, time-consuming, and require specialized molecular biology techniques and expensive equipment. In this study, we describe a novel PCR method for amplifying the BLV provirus from whole blood, thus eliminating the need for DNA extraction. Although the sensitivity of PCR directly from whole blood (PCR-DB) samples as measured in bovine blood containing BLV-infected cell lines was lower than that of nested PCR, the PCR-DB technique showed high specificity and reproducibility. Among 225 clinical samples, 49 samples were positive by nested PCR, and 37 samples were positive by PCR-DB. There were no false positive samples; thus, PCR-DB sensitivity and specificity were 75.51% and 100%, respectively. However, the provirus loads of the samples detected by nested PCR and not PCR-DB were quite low. Moreover, PCR-DB also stably amplified the BLV provirus from tumor tissue samples. PCR-DB method exhibited good reproducibility and excellent specificity and is suitable for screening of thousands of cattle, thus serving as a viable alternative to nested PCR and real-time PCR.",,"['Nishimori, Asami', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Nakahara, Ayako', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Nishimori A', 'Konnai S', 'Ikebuchi R', 'Okagawa T', 'Nakahara A', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku Kita 18- jo Nishi 9-chome, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0818, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160225,Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle/blood/virology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*veterinary', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*veterinary', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC4905833,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2016/02/26 06:00'],"['2016/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1292/jvms.15-0577 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2016 Jun 1;78(5):791-6. doi: 10.1292/jvms.15-0577.

CD200 has been shown to be overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although previous studies have confirmed the diagnostic value of CD200 in differentiating CLL from to other B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders especially mantle cell lymphoma, whether CD200 has prognostic significance in CLL remains to be determined. We evaluated the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD200 in 307 consecutive, untreated patients with CLL in our center using flow cytometry. Using a CD200 MFI cutoff of 189.5, these cases could be divided into two groups. Patients with lower CD200 MFI (< 189.5) had a significantly shorter time-to-treatment (TTT) than those with higher CD200 MFI (>/= 189.5) (median TTT: 2 months vs 28 months, p = 0.0008). However, the effect of CD200 MFI on overall survival was not significant (CD200 MFI < 189.5: undefined vs CD200 MFI >/= 189.5: undefined, P = 0.2379). In subgroup analysis, CD200 MFI retained its prognostic value in patients with favourable characteristics such as Binet stage A disease, mutated IGHV status, normal TP53 or negative CD38 expression.

In the testing group (n = 157), high RUNX1 expression (RUNX1high) was associated with poorer overall survival (OS; P = 0.0025) and event-free survival (EFS; P = 0.0025) than low RUNX1 expression (RUNX1low). In addition, the prognostic significance of RUNX1 was confirmed using European Leukemia Net (ELN) genetic categories and multivariable analysis, which was further validated using a second independent CN-AML cohort (n = 162, OS; P = 0.03953). To better understand the mechanisms of RUNX1, we investigated genome-wide gene/microRNAs expression signatures and cell signaling pathways associated with RUNX1 expression status. Several known oncogenes/oncogenic microRNAs and cell signaling pathways were all up-regulated, while some anti-oncogenes and molecules of immune activation were down-regulated in RUNX1high CN-AML patients.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of the XN analyzer supplemented with the WPC channel for differentiating between reactive and neoplastic leukocytosis. METHODS: Blood samples of 253 patients with viral infections, lymphoma or leukemia were analyzed by the Sysmex XN-2000 analyzer equipped with the WPC channel. The results were compared to routine leukocyte differentiation using the routine Sysmex XE-2100 analyzer and automated digital microscopy (DM96). The combined information from standard morphology, immune phenotyping and clinical diagnosis served as a reference. RESULTS: The XN WPC channel demonstrated an excellent performance for differentiating neoplastic (AUC=0.933) and reactive leukocytosis (AUC=0.900) as compared to morphological smear examination (AUC=0.949 and AUC=0.968, respectively) or to the differentiation results of our routine hematology analyzer (AUC=0.630 and AUC=0.635, respectively).

Although genomic alterations have been broadly reported, protein studies are still in their early stages. Herein, a 224-antibody microarray has been employed to study the intracellular signalling pathways in a cohort of 14 newly diagnosed B-CLL patients as a preliminary study for further investigations. Several protein profiles were differentially identified across the cytogenetic and molecular alterations presented in the samples (deletion 13q14 and 17p13.1, trisomy 12, and NOTCH1 mutations) by a combination of affinity and MS/MS proteomics approaches. Among others altered cell signalling pathways, PKC family members were identified as down-regulated in nearly 75% of the samples tested with the antibody arrays. This might explain the rapid progression of the disease when showing p53, Rb1, or NOTCH1 mutations due to PKC-proteins family plays a critical role favouring the slowly progressive indolent behaviour of CLL. Additionally, the antibody microarray results were validated by a LC-MS/MS quantification strategy and compared to a transcriptomic CLL database. In summary, this research displays the usefulness of proteomic strategies to globally evaluate the protein alterations in CLL cells and select the possible biomarkers to be further studied with larger sample sizes.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recent findings show that zinc, an essential trace element in humans, is critically involved in regulating various signaling pathways and genes expression. However, its role in ES cell fate determination remains to be further explored. Here we showed that 2muM zinc chloride (ZnCl2) transiently maintained mouse ES cell pluripotency in vitro. The cultured mouse ES cells remained undifferentiated under 2muM ZnCl2 treatment in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal, retinoic acid (RA) or embryoid bodies (EBs) differentiation assays. In addition, ZnCl2 increased pluripotency genes expression and inhibited differentiation genes expression. Further mechanistic studies revealed that ZnCl2 transiently activated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling through promoting Stat3 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Stat3 signaling abrogated the effects of ZnCl2 on mouse ES cell pluripotency. Taken together, this study demonstrated a critical role of zinc in the pluripotency maintenance of mouse ES cells, as well as an important regulator of Stat3 signaling.",,"['Hu, Jing', 'Yang, Zhiyong', 'Wang, Jinbo', 'Yu, Jia', 'Guo, Jing', 'Liu, Shiying', 'Qian, Chunmei', 'Song, Liwen', 'Wu, Yi', 'Cheng, Jiajing']","['Hu J', 'Yang Z', 'Wang J', 'Yu J', 'Guo J', 'Liu S', 'Qian C', 'Song L', 'Wu Y', 'Cheng J']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'The First Clinical Medical College of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'The First Clinical Medical College of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160224,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chlorides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Zinc Compounds/*pharmacology']",PMC4765890,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2015/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0148994 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-36452 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Feb 24;11(2):e0148994. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0148994. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since a lower incidence of severe GVHD is advantageous in unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT), a higher incidence of GVHD using older MSDs could be overcome using cord blood for older patients. We retrospectively analyzed Japanese registration data of 2,091 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplastic syndrome aged 50 years or older who underwent MSD bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (n = 319), MSD peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) (n = 462), or unrelated CBT (n = 1,310) between 2007 and 2012. Median age of MSD was 56 (range, 38-74) years. Compared with CBT, the risk of developing extensive chronic GVHD was higher after BMT (hazard ratio [HR], 2.00; P = 0.001) or PBSCT (HR, 2.38; P < 0.001), and transplant-related mortality was lower after BMT (HR, 0.61; P < 0.001) or PBSCT (HR, 0.63; P < 0.001). Relapse rates were not significant difference between three groups. Although overall mortality was lower after BMT (HR, 0.67; P < 0.001) or PBSCT (HR, 0.75; P = 0.002) compared with CBT, the rates of a composite endpoint of GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) were not significant difference between three groups. These data showed that MSDs remain the best donor source for older patients, but CBT led to similar GRFS to BMT and PBSCT.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Konuma, Takaaki', 'Tsukada, Nobuhiro', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Ohno, Yuju', 'Miyakoshi, Shigesaburo', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Kobayashi, Naoki', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Matsuhashi, Yoshiko', 'Kato, Koji', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Miyamura, Koichi']","['Konuma T', 'Tsukada N', 'Kanda J', 'Uchida N', 'Ohno Y', 'Miyakoshi S', 'Kanamori H', 'Hidaka M', 'Sakura T', 'Onizuka M', 'Kobayashi N', 'Sawa M', 'Eto T', 'Matsuhashi Y', 'Kato K', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Miyamura K']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Medical Center, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Leukemia Research Center, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160328,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/genetics', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cause of Death', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/therapy', 'Neutrophils', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Siblings', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24340 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2016 May;91(5):E284-92. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24340.

Using phage display, we identified 2 high-affinity anti-CD56 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), m900 and m906, which bound to spatially separated non-overlapping epitopes with similar affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant 2.9 and 4.5 nM, respectively). m900 bound to the membrane proximal fibronectin type III-like domains, whereas m906 bound to the N-terminal IgG-like domains. m906 induced significant down-regulation of CD56 in 4 neuroblastoma cell lines tested, while m900-induced downregulation of CD56 was much lower. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) made by conjugation with a highly potent pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD) exhibited killing activity that correlated with CD56 down-regulation, and to some extent with in vivo binding ability of the antibodies. The m906PBD ADC was much more potent than m900PBD, likely due to higher CD56-mediated downregulation and stronger binding to cells. Treatment with m906PBD ADC resulted in very potent cytotoxicity (IC50: 0.05-1.7 pM). These results suggest a novel approach for targeting CD56-expressing neuroblastoma cells.

Resistance to one such compound, ABT-737, is due to increased levels of anti-apoptotic MCL1. Using chemical and genetic approaches, we show that resistance to ABT-737 is abrogated by inhibition of the mitochondrial RING E3 ligase, MARCH5. Mechanistically, this is due to increased expression of pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member, NOXA, and is associated with MARCH5 regulation of MCL1 ubiquitylation and stability in a NOXA-dependent manner.

Imatinib mesylate (IM), a competitive inhibitor of BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase activity, is the current standard therapy for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) which is caused by the BCR/ABL1 gene fusion encoding a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. However, up to 33 % of CML patients do not respond to therapy either initially or due to acquired resistance. Usually, IM resistance is due to the presence of BCR-ABL1 mutations but in many cases resistance is far from being completely understood or from being satisfactorily addressed from a therapeutic standpoint. Although second- and third-generation TKIs (e.g., dasatinib (DA), nilotinib, and bosutinib) were developed to override this phenomenon, resistance remains an unsolved problem. Above all, as more patients are treated with TKIs, more cases of resistance are expected and the discovery of biomarkers of resistance acquires a crucial clinical significance. We established a valuable in vitro experimental system that mimics the acquired resistance in the absence of mutations. It was developed by the continuous exposure of K562, a human CML-derived cell line expressing BCR-ABL gene, to increasing concentrations of IM and DA (over 36 and 24 weeks, respectively) allowing us to obtain several cell lines with different resistance levels, and therefore to evaluate drug transporters' role in the dynamic cellular responses allied with resistance evolution. The development of such cell models is fundamental to understand the role of drug transporters in resistance since the majority of previous studies were performed on cell lines engineered to over-express a single transporter. Drug transporters were overexpressed in the majority of resistant cell lines and cell lines from all levels of resistance had increased expression of more than one drug transporter. However, the transporters that attain higher mRNA overexpression (e.g., ABCB1 and ABCG2) did not substantiate a linear relation with the level of resistance. Also, variation in expression of these genes occurs over time of exposure to the same concentration of IM while maintaining resistance, suggesting that resistance mechanisms could vary dynamically in patients as disease progresses. Indeed, we observed that while responding patients demonstrated stable transporters' expression signatures in consecutive samples, in IM-resistant patients they vary significantly over time, advising caution when comparing single-point samples from responsive and resistant patients.",,"['Gromicho, Marta', 'Rueff, Jose', 'Rodrigues, Antonio Sebastiao']","['Gromicho M', 'Rueff J', 'Rodrigues AS']","['Centre for Toxicogenomics and Human Health, Genetics, Oncology and Human Toxicology, NOVA Medical School/Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Rua Camara Pestana 6, 1150-008, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Toxicogenomics and Human Health, Genetics, Oncology and Human Toxicology, NOVA Medical School/Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Rua Camara Pestana 6, 1150-008, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Toxicogenomics and Human Health, Genetics, Oncology and Human Toxicology, NOVA Medical School/Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Rua Camara Pestana 6, 1150-008, Lisbon, Portugal. sebastiao.rodrigues@nms.unl.pt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)']",IM,"['Cryopreservation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Drug transporters', 'Gene expression', 'K562 cell line', 'Multidrug resistance']",2016/02/26 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-3347-1_6 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1395:75-85. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3347-1_6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This poses a serious clinical dilemma, as the prognosis and treatment of either condition are markedly different. Although most reactive myeloid infiltrates require a simple course of corticosteroids before the symptoms regress, the development of LC may require chemotherapeutic or transplant-variant interventions. Erythroblast transformation specific regulated gene-1 (ERG) is a member of the erythroblast transformation specific family of transcription factors, which are downstream effectors of mitogenic signaling transduction pathways. ERG is a key regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis and has recently been found to be overexpressed in acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, the authors aimed to explore the diagnostic utility of ERG immunohistochemistry in LC by comparing the frequency and expression level of ERG immunostain in 32 skin biopsies, 16 with LC and 16 with reactive leukocytic infiltrates. A significantly higher frequency of ERG positivity was detected in LC (13/16, 81.4%), compared with reactive conditions (0/16). In addition, the expression level of ERG in LC, calculated using H score (mean +/- standard error of mean, 188 +/- 24), was significantly higher than that in nonneoplastic leukocytic infiltrate (28 +/- 8). Our results strongly suggest that ERG expression is potentially an extremely useful marker to distinguish between cases of LC from those of reactive myeloid infiltrates in the skin with a positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 84.2%.",,"['Xu, Bin', 'Naughton, Daisy', 'Busam, Klaus', 'Pulitzer, Melissa']","['Xu B', 'Naughton D', 'Busam K', 'Pulitzer M']","['Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Young Adult']",PMC5026187,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/DAD.0000000000000491 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2016 Sep;38(9):672-7. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0000000000000491.,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS791449'],,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanisms, however, are complex and not fully understood. Syndecan-1 is a proteoglycan that has various functions relevant for tumor progression including cell-cell communication and cell-matrix interactions. Moreover, its two glycosaminoglycan-binding sites suggest that it may interfere with glycoproteins such as osteoprotegerin, a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis. Thus, we hypothesize that tumor-derived syndecan-1 alters osteoclast biology by modulating osteoprotegerin. METHODS: Syndecan-1 expression was down-regulated via siRNA and the cell fate of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 was investigated. Furthermore, we determined the regulation of syndecan-1 by dexamethasone, a commonly used antiemetic in breast cancer therapy. Additionally, we analyzed the genesis and activity of osteoclasts in indirect co-culture experiments using supernatants from MCF-7 cells with deficient and sufficient levels of syndecan-1. RESULTS: Dexamethasone time- and dose-dependently increased syndecan-1 expression up to 4-fold but did not alter cell behavior. Syndecan-1 up-regulation did not affect the survival or migration of breast cancer cells. Depletion of syndecan-1 using siRNA led to decreased vitality of progesterone receptor-positive cell lines. In MCF-7 cells osteoprotegerin production was up-regulated 2.5-fold after syndecan-1 knock-down. The culture of osteoclast precursors with the supernatant of MCF-7 cells with reduced syndecan-1 levels suppressed osteoclast formation and activity by 21% and 23%, respectively. Adding neutralizing antibodies to osteoprotegerin to the breast cancer supernatants reversed osteoclastogenesis. CONCLUSION: Thus, we identified tumor-derived syndecan-1 as a novel positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis and new player in the tumor-bone dialog.",,"['Benad-Mehner, Peggy', 'Thiele, Stefanie', 'Rachner, Tilman D', 'Gobel, Andy', 'Rauner, Martina', 'Hofbauer, Lorenz C']","['Benad-Mehner P', 'Thiele S', 'Rachner TD', 'Gobel A', 'Rauner M', 'Hofbauer LC']","['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Diseases, Department of Medicine III, Technical University Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Diseases, Department of Medicine III, Technical University Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Diseases, Department of Medicine III, Technical University Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Diseases, Department of Medicine III, Technical University Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Diseases, Department of Medicine III, Technical University Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Diseases, Department of Medicine III, Technical University Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Technical University, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131115,Netherlands,J Bone Oncol,Journal of bone oncology,101610292,,,,PMC4723417,['NOTNLM'],"['ACTB, beta-actin', 'Breast cancer', 'C, control', 'DEX, dexamethasone', 'ER, estrogen receptor', 'ERBB2, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2', 'GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase', 'OPG, osteoprotegerin', 'Osteoclast', 'Osteoprotegerin', 'PR, progesterone receptor', 'RANKL, receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand', 'SDC1, syndecan-1', 'Syndecan-1']",2014/03/01 00:00,2014/03/01 00:01,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2013/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jbo.2013.11.001 [doi]', 'S2212-1374(13)00065-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Bone Oncol. 2013 Nov 15;3(1):18-24. doi: 10.1016/j.jbo.2013.11.001. eCollection 2014 Mar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The positive-sense RNA of its genome contains a 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), 5' leader sequence, gag, pol, env, and 3' LTR. Transcription from proviral DNA begins from the R region of the 5' LTR and ends at the polyadenylation signal located at the R region of the other end of the 3' LTR. There is a 5' splice site in the 5' leader sequence and a 3' splice site at the 3' end of the pol region. Both full-length unspliced mRNAs and a singly spliced mRNA (env-mRNA) are produced in MLV-infected cells. The MLV Env protein plays important roles both in viral adsorption to host cells and in neuropathogenic disease in MLV-infected mice and rats. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling Env expression is important for determining the functions of the Env protein. We have previously shown that splicing increases env-mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Generally, mRNA polysome formation correlates with translation efficiency. Therefore, here we investigated the effects of env-mRNA splicing on polysome formation to identify mechanisms for Env up-regulation due to splicing. We performed polysome profile analyses using Env-expression plasmids producing spliced or unspliced env-mRNA and showed that the former formed polysomes more efficiently than the latter. Thus, splicing of env-mRNA facilitated polysome formation, suggesting that this contributes to up-regulation of Env expression. We replaced the env region of the expression plasmids with a luciferase (luc) gene, and found that in this case both unspliced and spliced luc-mRNA formed polysomes to a similar extent. Thus, we conclude that whether mRNA polysome formation is affected by splicing depends on the structure of gene in question.",,"['Machinaga, Akihito', 'Ishihara, Syuhei', 'Shirai, Akiko', 'Takase-Yoden, Sayaka']","['Machinaga A', 'Ishihara S', 'Shirai A', 'Takase-Yoden S']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Graduate School of Engineering, Soka University Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Graduate School of Engineering, Soka University Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Graduate School of Engineering, Soka University Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Graduate School of Engineering, Soka UniversityTokyo, Japan; Department of Science and Engineering for Sustainable Innovation, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Soka UniversityTokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160216,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC4754430,['NOTNLM'],"['Env protein', 'env-mRNA', 'murine leukemia virus', 'polysome', 'splicing']",2016/02/26 06:00,2016/02/26 06:01,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2016.00160 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2016 Feb 16;7:160. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00160. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) produced by CMV-challenged T cells may serve as an immune marker differentiating these 2 populations. We prospectively monitored 63 CMV-seropositive allo-HCT recipients with a CMV-specific enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and for CMV infection from the period before transplantation to day 100 after transplantation. Assay results above certain thresholds (50 spots per 250 000 cells for immediate early 1 or 100 spots per 250 000 cells for phosphoprotein 65) identified patients who were protected against CMV infection as long as they had no graft-versus-host disease and/or were not receiving systemic corticosteroids. Based on the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model, the only significant factor for preventing CMV reactivation was a CMV-specific ELISPOT response above the determined thresholds (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, .05-.97; P = .046). Use of this assay as an additional tool for managing allo-HCT recipients at risk for CMV reactivation needs further validation in future studies. Application of this new approach may reduce the duration and intensity of CMV monitoring and the duration of prophylaxis or treatment with antiviral agents in those who have achieved CMV-specific immune reconstitution.","['(c) The Author 2016.

This study compares cancer risk in children conceived by ART to that in children conceived without. METHODS: The Medical Birth Registry of Norway contains individual information on all children born in Norway (including information of ART conceptions). All children born between 1984 and 2011 constituted the study cohort, and cancer data were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Follow-up started at date of birth and ended on the date of the first cancer diagnosis, death, emigration, or December 31, 2011. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of overall cancer risk between children conceived by ART and those not. Cancer risk was also assessed separately for all childhood cancer types. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 1 628 658 children, of which 25 782 were conceived by ART. Of the total 4554 cancers, 51 occurred in ART-conceived children. Risk of overall cancer was not significantly elevated (HR 1.21; 95% CI 0.90-1.63). However, increased risk of leukemia was observed for children conceived by ART compared with those who were not (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.02-2.73). Elevated risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma was also found for ART-conceived children (HR 3.63; 95% CI 1.12-11.72), although this was based on small numbers. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based cohort study found elevated risks of leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma in children conceived by ART.",['Copyright (c) 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],"['Reigstad, Marte Myhre', 'Larsen, Inger Kristin', 'Myklebust, Tor Age', 'Robsahm, Trude Eid', 'Oldereid, Nan Birgitte', 'Brinton, Louise A', 'Storeng, Ritsa']","['Reigstad MM', 'Larsen IK', 'Myklebust TA', 'Robsahm TE', 'Oldereid NB', 'Brinton LA', 'Storeng R']","[""Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Women's Health and Cancer Registry of Norway, Institute of Population-Based Cancer Research, Oslo, Norway; and martereigstad@gmail.com."", 'Cancer Registry of Norway, Institute of Population-Based Cancer Research, Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Cancer Registry of Norway, Institute of Population-Based Cancer Research, Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Cancer Registry of Norway, Institute of Population-Based Cancer Research, Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Section for Reproductive Medicine, Department of Gynecology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway;', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Women's Health and.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160204,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Registries', '*Reproductive Techniques, Assisted', 'Risk Factors']",PMC5178823,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2016/07/09 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2015/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2015-2061 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2015-2061 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2016 Mar;137(3):e20152061. doi: 10.1542/peds.2015-2061.

MM patients diagnosed in 1997-2010 at age >/=15 years were selected from the Swedish (nationwide) and 12 German cancer registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to assess risk of a specific SPC compared to risk of the same first cancer in the corresponding background population. Among 18,735 survivors of first MM in Germany and 7,560 in Sweden, overall 752 and 349 SPCs were recorded, respectively. Significantly elevated SIRs of specific SPCs were observed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; SIR = 4.9) in Germany and for kidney cancer (2.3), AML (2.3) and nervous system cancer (1.9) in Sweden. Elevated risk for AML was more pronounced in the earlier diagnosis period compared to the later, i.e., 9.7 (4.2-19) for 1997-2003 period versus 3.5 (1.5-6.9) for 2004-2010 in Germany; 3.8 (1.4-8.3) for 1997-2003 versus 2.2 (0.3-7.8) for 2004-2010 in Sweden.

We describe a comprehensive analysis of the mutational landscape of these tumours, combining whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. We identify an average of 14+/-5 somatic mutations in coding sequences of sorted monocyte DNA and the signatures of three mutational processes. Serial sequencing demonstrates that the response to hypomethylating agents is associated with changes in DNA methylation and gene expression, without any decrease in the mutation allele burden, nor prevention of new genetic alteration occurence.

Mechanisms that keep this balance in check include regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs consist of a small but heterogeneous population, which may be identified by the phenotype, CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127-. The role of Tregs in pathogenesis of cancers is thus far supported by evidence of increased Tregs in various cancers and may contribute to poorer prognosis. Tregs may also be important in acute leukaemias. OBJECTIVE: A review of the literature on Tregs in acute leukaemias was conducted and Tregs were determined in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALLs). RESULTS: Studies on Tregs in B-cell ALL are few and controversial. We observed a significantly increased percentage of Tregs (mean+/-SD, 9.72 +/- 3.79% vs. 7.05 +/- 1.74%; P = 0.047) in the bone marrow/peripheral blood of ALL (n = 17) compared to peripheral blood of normal controls (n = 35). A positive trend between Tregs and age (R = 0.474, P = 0.055, n = 17) implicates this factor of poor prognosis in B-cell ALL. DISCUSSION: Tregs in cancer are particularly significant in immunotherapy. The manipulation of the immune system to treat cancer has for a long time ignored regulatory mechanisms inducible or in place. In lymphoma studies, tumour-specific mechanisms that are unlike conventional methods in the induction of Tregs have been hypothesized. In addition, tumour-infiltrating Tregs may present different profiles from peripheral blood pictures. Tregs will continue to be dissected to reveal its mysteries and their impact on clinical significance.",,"['Idris, Siti-Zuleha', 'Hassan, Norfarazieda', 'Lee, Le-Jie', 'Md Noor, Sabariah', 'Osman, Raudhawati', 'Abdul-Jalil, Marsitah', 'Nordin, Abdul-Jalil', 'Abdullah, Maha']","['Idris SZ', 'Hassan N', 'Lee LJ', 'Md Noor S', 'Osman R', 'Abdul-Jalil M', 'Nordin AJ', 'Abdullah M']","['a Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences , Universiti Putra Malaysia , 43400 Serdang , Selangor , Malaysia.', 'a Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences , Universiti Putra Malaysia , 43400 Serdang , Selangor , Malaysia.', 'a Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences , Universiti Putra Malaysia , 43400 Serdang , Selangor , Malaysia.', 'a Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences , Universiti Putra Malaysia , 43400 Serdang , Selangor , Malaysia.', 'b Haematology Unit, Department of Pathology , Hospital Kuala Lumpur , Jalan Pahang , Malaysia.', 'a Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences , Universiti Putra Malaysia , 43400 Serdang , Selangor , Malaysia.', 'a Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences , Universiti Putra Malaysia , 43400 Serdang , Selangor , Malaysia.', 'a Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences , Universiti Putra Malaysia , 43400 Serdang , Selangor , Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160224,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Age', 'B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'Regulatory T cells']",2016/02/26 06:00,2017/03/04 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.2015.1101965 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 May;21(4):206-12. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2015.1101965.

In recent years, they have been proven to play vital roles in haematological malignancies. In this review we briefly introduce some basic knowledge of microRNAs and summarize their ectopic expression in haematological malignancies, especially in leukaemia. We will also discuss the potential of microRNAs in the diagnosis of leukaemia, in the determination of the clinical prognosis of diverse subtypes, and in targeted therapy. DISCUSSION: Despite current adoption of novel biological agents combining traditional chemotherapy regimens, leukaemia remains to have undesirable clinical outcomes due to inaccurate diagnosis, invasiveness of the disease, and patients' intolerance to chemotherapy, thus brand new therapeutic directions are urgently needed. MiRNAs regulate gene expression by means of binding to the 3'-untranslated regions of corresponding mRNAs, leading to the degradation of targeted mRNA or the inhibition of translation. It has been confirmed that they can either function as tumour inhibitors, or may trigger tumourigenesis in certain situations, this specific dual characteristic undoubtedly attract scientists to explore their roles in haematological malignancies. It is of great necessity to summarize the roles of miRNAs in haematological malignancies diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and clinical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies may take full advantage of miRNAs detection in diagnosing, in choosing targeted biological therapy, and in avoiding predictable side effect, thus the overall survival rate and cure efficiency of leukaemia should improve.",,"['Li, Xin', 'Zhong, Hua']","['Li X', 'Zhong H']","['a Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , P.R.

There have been reports of increased toxicity, as well as altered therapeutic outcomes in pediatric patients with DS and leukemia. This review is focused on the pharmacokinetics of cytotoxic drugs in pediatric patients with leukemia and DS. The available literature suggests that methotrexate and thioguanine display altered pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric patients with DS. It has been hypothesized that the variable pharmacokinetics of these drugs may contribute to the increased incidence of treatment-related toxicities seen in DS.

PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective cohort study of children with B-ALL treated from 2008 to 2014 at the North Carolina Children's Hospital. Patient demographics, cytogenetics, and diagnosis of thrombosis were extracted by blinded chart review. Analysis was performed examining the relationship between RUNX1 amplification and thrombosis. RESULTS: We identified 119 patients with B-ALL and a median age of 4.9 years (interquartile range, 2.9 to 8.6 y) at diagnosis. Four patients (3%) had RUNX1 amplification. The average number of RUNX1 copies among those with amplification was 5 (SD 0.81 [range, 4 to 6]). Eighteen thromboses were diagnosed within 6 months of starting treatment. These events were more likely among patients with RUNX1 amplification than in patients without amplification (75% vs. 13%; RR 5.75, 95% confidence interval, 2.75-12.01).

At the time of relapse, the ionized calcium level was 1.99 mmol/L. Rehydration with 0.9% saline and furosemide and methylprednisolone (MP) treatment were used for the treatment of hypercalcemia. The serum ionized calcium level increased to 2.2 mmol/L despite hydration, furosemide, and MP treatment. Then, a single-dose pamidronate (1 mg/kg/dose) was administered. Despite pamidronate treatment, the calcium level continued to rise. Next, calcitonin at a dose of 8 IU/kg/dose, 4 doses per day, was added to the treatment.

However, there exists a great degree of inter-laboratory variability on issues like panel selection, antibody combinations, gating strategies, fluorochromes, and clonal selection. AIM: The primary aim of this study was to derive a minimal panel of antibodies and evaluate its diagnostic usefulness in acute leukemias by flowcytometry by using the detailed immune-phenotype of different lineage-specific or non-specific markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study involved 400 newly diagnosed cases of acute leukemias. Bone marrow aspirate samples were subjected to morphological evaluation, cytogenetics and flow cytometric immunophenotyping. RESULTS: A minimal panel of eight antibodies comprising of CD45/CD34/CD19/MPO/cytoCD3/CD64/CD117/CD79a was derived by applying different permutations and combinations with a diagnostic yield of 97.5%. The minimal panel was further validated by testing in an independent cohort of patients with similar demographic characteristics, where it showed a high diagnostic yield of 98% in comparison with the screening panels proposed by other recently published studies. CONCLUSION: It may be concluded that the diagnostic performance of the eight antibody panel is better than most other panels used across the different laboratories in terms of yield, number of antibodies used and the scientific approach used to derive and validate the results and so henceforth may be applied in any setting with limited resources for better diagnostic accuracy.",,"['Singh, Neha', 'Pati, Hara Prasad P', 'Tyagi, Seema', 'Deka, Roopam', 'Sharma, Rahul', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Singh N', 'Pati HP', 'Tyagi S', 'Deka R', 'Sharma R', 'Saxena R']","['a Department of Hematology , All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi 110029 , India.', 'a Department of Hematology , All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi 110029 , India.', 'a Department of Hematology , All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi 110029 , India.', 'a Department of Hematology , All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi 110029 , India.', 'a Department of Hematology , All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi 110029 , India.', 'a Department of Hematology , All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi 110029 , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160224,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Immunophenotyping']",2016/02/26 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1139792 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Jul;21(6):338-42. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1139792.

Human JNK1 is a cytosolic kinase belonging to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which plays a major role in intracrinal signal transduction cascade mechanism. Overexpressed human JNK1, a key kinase interacts with other kinases involved in the etiology of many cancers, such as skin cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma. Thus, to unveil a novel human JNK1 antagonist, receptor-based pharmacophore modeling was performed with the available eighteen cocrystal structures of JNK1 in the protein data bank. Eighteen e-pharmacophores were generated from the 18 cocrystal structures. Four common e-pharmacophores were developed from the 18 e-pharmacophores, which were used as three-dimensional (3D) query for shape-based similarity screening against more than one million small molecules to generate a JNK1 ligand library. Rigid receptor docking (RRD) performed using GLIDE v6.3 for the 1683 compounds from in-house library and 18 cocrystal ligands with human JNK1 from lower stringency to higher stringency revealed 17 leads. Further to derive the best leads, dock complexes obtained from RRD were studied further with quantum-polarized ligand docking (QPLD), induced fit docking (IFD) and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA). Four leads have showed lesser binding free energy and better binding affinity towards JNK1 compared to 18 cocrystal ligands. Additionally, JNK1-lead1 complex interaction stability was reasserted using 50 ns MD simulations run and also compared with the best resolute cocrystal structure using Desmond v3.8. Thus, the results obtained from RRD, QPLD, IFD and MD simulations indicated that lead1 might be used as a potent antagonist toward human JNK1 in cancer therapeutics.",,"['Katari, Sudheer Kumar', 'Natarajan, Pradeep', 'Swargam, Sandeep', 'Kanipakam, Hema', 'Pasala, Chiranjeevi', 'Umamaheswari, Amineni']","['Katari SK', 'Natarajan P', 'Swargam S', 'Kanipakam H', 'Pasala C', 'Umamaheswari A']","['a Department of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Center , SVIMS University , Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh , India.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Center , SVIMS University , Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh , India.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Center , SVIMS University , Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh , India.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Center , SVIMS University , Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh , India.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Center , SVIMS University , Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh , India.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Center , SVIMS University , Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160224,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)']",IM,"['Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*chemistry/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*JNK1', '*MD simulations', '*cancer', '*e-pharmacophore', '*molecular docking']",2016/02/26 06:00,2017/04/05 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10799893.2016.1141955 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2016 Dec;36(6):558-571. doi: 10.3109/10799893.2016.1141955.

METHODS: Literature relevant to measurement of nutritional status and the impact of nutritional status on important clinical outcomes in this population, and others of relevance, was reviewed. RESULTS: Arm anthropometry provides more accurate information on nutritional status than measures based on body weight in children with cancer. Both over- and under-nutrition are important determinants of tolerance of chemotherapy, compliance with treatment, relapse of disease, and survival. These relationships are subject to change with nutritional intervention. There are valuable roles for educational tools and 'ready-to-use-therapeutic-foods'. DISCUSSION: Assessment of nutritional status is mandatory in this population and accomplishable at various levels of sophistication according to available resources. Recognition of the fundamental role of nutritional status in affecting outcomes in children with leukemia is expanding, but knowledge gaps remain. An apparently counter-intuitive strategy of caloric restriction may be worthy of exploration. There is a particular need to establish normative data, including measures of body composition, in children in LMICs.

METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Two serial interviews were conducted with each participant, two to four weeks apart, within the first year of diagnosis or post-relapse. FINDINGS: AL creates a state of imbalance, which may initiate a search for new equilibrium. Patients' journeys toward making sense of their illness may involve three interchangeable processes.

DESIGN: Prospective and descriptive. SETTING: A university-based outpatient cancer clinic in Wuerzburg, Germany. SAMPLE: 37 outpatients with CML on oral TKIs. . METHODS: FoP was assessed with a questionnaire. Clinical data were extracted from the medical charts.. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Frequency and contents of FoP. FINDINGS: Sum scores and levels of FoP in the sample population (N = 37) were as high as in cancer populations with more unfavorable life expectancies. Regarding single items, fear that medication may harm the body was most prevalent, regardless of group affiliation. The actual fear of disease progression was only ranked sixth out of 12 items for the total sample and was ranked second by the second-generation TKI group. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of outpatients with CML, FoP was frequent and most often generated by fears of treatment side effects. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should be vigilant about FoP in this population. Established questionnaires may help to identify and evaluate this frequent source of distress. Specific communication could reveal unmet informational needs and may help to initiate interventions. Additional studies are needed to confirm the numbers in a larger cohort of patients, to examine the prevalence during the course of disease, to search for potential influences on the outcome (i.e., via adherence), and to extract the best interventions.",,"['Hefner, Jochen', 'Csef, Eva-Johanna', 'Kunzmann, Volker']","['Hefner J', 'Csef EJ', 'Kunzmann V']","['University of Wuerzburg.', 'University of Wuerzburg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', '*Fear', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Medication Adherence/*psychology', 'Outpatients/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*therapeutic use', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['anxiety', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'distress', 'fear', 'imatinib']",2016/02/26 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1188/16.ONF.190-197 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2016 Mar;43(2):190-7. doi: 10.1188/16.ONF.190-197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While investigating leukemia susceptibility genes, we discovered a very rare p.L254P NT5C1A missense variant in the substrate recognition motif. Given the paucity of cellular drug response data from the NT5C1A germline variation, we characterized p.L254P and eight rare variants of NT5C1A from genomic databases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through lentiviral infection, we created HEK293 cell lines that stably overexpress wild-type NT5C1A, p.L254P, or eight NT5C1A variants reported in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Exome Variant Server (one truncating and seven missense). IC50 values were determined by cytotoxicity assays after exposure to chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs (cladribine, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil). In addition, we used structure-based homology modeling to generate a three-dimensional model for the C-terminal region of NT5C1A. RESULTS: The p.R180X (truncating), p.A214T, and p.L254P missense changes were the only variants that significantly impaired protein function across all nucleotide analogs tested (>5-fold difference vs. wild-type; P<0.05). Several of the remaining variants individually showed differential effects (both more and less resistant) across the analogs tested. The homology model provided a structural framework to understand the impact of NT5C1A mutants on catalysis and drug processing. The model predicted active site residues within NT5C1A motif III and we experimentally confirmed that p.K314 (not p.K320) is required for NT5C1A activity. CONCLUSION: We characterized germline variation and predicted protein structures of NT5C1A. Individual missense changes showed considerable variation in response to the different nucleoside analogs tested, which may impact patients' responses to treatment.",,"['Saliba, Jason', 'Zabriskie, Ryan', 'Ghosh, Rajarshi', 'Powell, Bradford C', 'Hicks, Stephanie', 'Kimmel, Marek', 'Meng, Qingchang', 'Ritter, Deborah I', 'Wheeler, David A', 'Gibbs, Richard A', 'Tsai, Francis T F', 'Plon, Sharon E']","['Saliba J', 'Zabriskie R', 'Ghosh R', 'Powell BC', 'Hicks S', 'Kimmel M', 'Meng Q', 'Ritter DI', 'Wheeler DA', 'Gibbs RA', 'Tsai FT', 'Plon SE']","[""Departments of aMolecular and Human Genetics bBiochemistry and Molecular Biology cMolecular and Cellular Biology dHuman Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine eDepartment of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine fDepartment of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, Texas, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5C1A protein, human)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/chemistry/*genetics"", 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Protein Conformation/drug effects']",PMC4853247,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2017/03/17 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000208 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2016 Jun;26(6):271-9. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000208.,,"['K12 GM084897/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM104980/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM111084/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HG007436/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008307/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS755133'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CP-CML patients resistant to initial TKIs face a poorer prognosis and significantly higher CML-related mortality. We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the specific causes of deaths (diseases progression versus drug-related) in CP-CML patients receiving second- or third-line therapy. We identified eight studies based on our criteria that reported causes of death. Overall, 5% of second-line and 10% of third-line patients died during the study follow-up period. For second-line, (7 studies, n=1926), mortality was attributed to disease progression for 41% of deaths, 2% to treatment-related causes, 3% were treatment-unrelated, and 50% were unspecified adverse events (AEs), not likely related to study drug. In third-line, (2 studies, n=144), 71% deaths were attributed to disease progression, 7% treatment-related AEs, 14% treatment-unrelated and 7% unspecified AEs. Annual death rates for second- and third-line therapy were significantly higher than for general population in similar age group. Our findings suggest death attributed to disease progression is approximately 10 times that due to treatment-related AEs in patients with CP-CML receiving second- or third-line therapy. Therefore, the potential benefits of effective treatment for these patients with the currently available TKIs outweigh the risks of treatment-induced AEs.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Koalas in many parts of Australia are under multiple threats including habitat destruction, dog attacks, vehicular accidents, and infectious diseases such as Chlamydia spp. and the koala retrovirus (KoRV), which may contribute to the incidence of lymphoma and leukaemia in this species. Due to a lack of koala-specific immune reagents and assays there is currently no way to adequately analyse the immune response in healthy, diseased or vaccinated animals. This paper reports the production and characterisation of the first anti-koala CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb). The koala CD4 gene was identified and used to develop recombinant proteins for mAb production. Fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb was used to measure the levels of CD4(+) lymphocytes collected from koala spleens (41.1%, range 20-45.1%) lymph nodes (36.3%, range 19-55.9%) and peripheral blood (23.8%, range 17.3-35%) by flow cytometry. Biotin-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb was used for western blot to determine an approximate size of 52 kDa for the koala CD4 molecule and used in immunohistochemistry to identify CD4(+) cells in the paracortical region and germinal centres of spleen and lymph nodes. Using the anti-CD4 mab we showed that CD4 cells from vaccinated, but not control, koalas proliferated following in vitro stimulation with UV-inactivated Chlamydia pecorum and recombinant chlamydial antigens. Since CD4(+) T cells have been shown to play a pivotal role in clearing chlamydial infection in both human and mouse infections, using this novel antibody will help determine the role CD4(+) T cells play in protection against chlamydial infection in koalas and also enhance our knowledge of how KoRV affects the koala immune system.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the study was to study the pattern of adverse drug reactions in the Oncology department of a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted in the Oncology department of a tertiary care hospital in which ADRs were reported spontaneously. The ADRs were noted from 1st January, 2007 to 30th June, 2011. Following were noted: demographics, premedication (if any), diagnosis, chemotherapy (regimen, cycles), medication history, and alteration in the treatment or co morbidities, ADRs (severity and management). Adverse drug reactions were noted by patient interview, collaborating with information on file, recording changes in the prescribing chart and investigations, consulting the doctor on duty. RESULTS: During this study period, there were total of 14,475 visits of patients from which 2500 ADRs were recorded. Maximum number of ADRs were noted with platinum compounds (25.52%) followed by pyrimidine antagonists (19.88%). The most common malignancy reported in our hospital was Carcinoma breast (20%) followed by leukemia (12%) and Ca ovary (12%). Alopecia (27.76%) was the most common ADR followed by anemia (7.48%), thrombocytopenia (6.96%) and constipation (6.16%). CONCLUSION: Alopecia is the most common ADR and platinum compounds were responsible for the maximum number of ADRs.

It is the result of a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, creating BCR-ABL fusion transcripts, b3a2, b2a2, and e1a2. The aim of our study was to determine the type of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts for molecular diagnosis and investigate the frequency of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts in CML patients by multiplex RT-PCR in CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single reaction with multiple primers multiplex PCR was used to detect and investigate the type and frequency in 200 CML patients among which 116, 33, and 51 were in CP, AP, and BC phase, respectively. RESULTS: The study included 200 CML patients, among whom breakpoints in b3a2, b2a2 transcripts were detected in 68% and 24%, respectively, while 8% of the patients showed both b3a2/b2a2. A statistically significant difference was seen between frequency of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts and gender (P = 0.03), molecular response (P = 0.04), and hematological response (P = 0.05). However, there was no correlation found between frequencies of BCR-/ABL fusion transcripts and other clinicopathological parameters like age, type of therapy, thrombocytopenia, and white blood cell count. CONCLUSION: Multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is useful and saves time in the detection of BCR-ABL variants; the occurrence of these transcripts associated with CML can assist in prognosis and treatment of disease.",,"['Mir, Rashid', 'Ahmad, I', 'Javid, J', 'Zuberi, M', 'Yadav, P', 'Shazia, R', 'Masroor, M', 'Guru, S', 'Ray, P C', 'Gupta, N', 'Saxena, A']","['Mir R', 'Ahmad I', 'Javid J', 'Zuberi M', 'Yadav P', 'Shazia R', 'Masroor M', 'Guru S', 'Ray PC', 'Gupta N', 'Saxena A']","['Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2015_52_3_314_176741 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.176741 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2015 Jul-Sep;52(3):314-8. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.176741.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is limited Indian data on APL. We aimed to analyze data of APL patients treated with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline based chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 34 cases of APL were treated at our center over 4 years. Induction chemotherapy consisted of a combination of ATRA and daunorubicin. RESULTS: Most of our patients were intermediate risk (50%) followed by high risk (41.17%). Induction mortality was 14.7%. We observed a high incidence of febrile neutropenia (91%) and 50% of our patients developed ATRA syndrome. Four patients (11.76%) relapsed during follow-up (median - 15 months, range: 13-33 months). There was no correlation between risk status and death or relapse or ATRA syndrome. Median event free survival (EFS) duration was not reached however mean duration was 38.45 +/- 3.84 months. Median overall survival (OS) duration was also not reached at 53 months of follow-up. The 4 year OS and EFS were 75.45% and 64.5% respectively. On multivariate analysis, only disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) significantly correlated with a poor OS and EFS. DISCUSSION: Our data reflects that APL remains a highly curable malignancy with good response to ATRA plus anthracycline based chemotherapy even with a greater number of high and intermediate risk patients. Only DIC during induction chemotherapy bore an impact on survival in our patients.",,"['Dayama, A', 'Dass, J', 'Seth, T', 'Mahapatra, M', 'Mishra, P C', 'Saxena, R']","['Dayama A', 'Dass J', 'Seth T', 'Mahapatra M', 'Mishra PC', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,2016/02/26 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2015_52_3_309_176731 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.176731 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2015 Jul-Sep;52(3):309-12. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.176731.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experience at a university hospital in India.,300-3,10.4103/0019-509X.176722 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of traumatic lumbar puncture (TLP) at diagnosis of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Risk factors associated with TLP were assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed from the records of children with ALL who were treated from January 2010 to December 2012. RESULTS: A total of 311 patients with median age of 5 years (range: 1-13) were treated for ALL. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis obtained from first LP revealed 275: Central nervous system 1 (CNS 1) (no blasts); 8: CNS 3 (blasts positive); and 28: TLP. Twenty-eight (9%) patients relapsed. Twelve (3.9%) had a CNS relapse. A TLP at diagnosis was not associated with an increased risk of systemic or CNS relapse (P = 0.298, 0.295). Three years event-free survival of patients with TLP and without atraumatic LP (ATLP) at diagnosis was 56 +/- 5.2% and 51.8 +/- 12.4%, (P = 0.520). Three years overall survival with TLP and ATLP was 73.3 +/- 3.5% and 70.4 +/- 12.5%, respectively, (P = 0.963). Median platelet count in patients with TLP was significantly lower than those without TLP (10,000/muL and 28,000/muL, P < 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed for predicting the risk of TLP based on platelet count. Area under the curve was 0.74 +/- 0.05 (95% confidence interval 0.64-0.84). Platelet count < 23.5 x 109/L at the time of LP had 75% sensitivity and 64.4% specificity in predicting a TLP. CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet counts are significantly associated with risk of TLP.

Inactivating alterations of Polycomb repressive complex 2 components are frequent in human ETP-ALL, but their functional role is largely undefined. We have studied the involvement of Ezh2 in a murine model of NRASQ61K-driven leukemia that recapitulates phenotypic and transcriptional features of ETP-ALL. Homozygous inactivation of Ezh2 cooperated with oncogenic NRASQ61K to accelerate leukemia onset. Inactivation of Ezh2 accentuated expression of genes highly expressed in human ETP-ALL and in normal murine early thymic progenitors. Moreover, we found that Ezh2 contributes to the silencing of stem-cell- and early-progenitor-cell-associated genes. Loss of Ezh2 also resulted in increased activation of STAT3 by tyrosine 705 phosphorylation. Our data mechanistically link Ezh2 inactivation to stem-cell-associated transcriptional programs and increased growth/survival signaling, features that convey an adverse prognosis in patients.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

To the best of our knowledge we report the first case of peanut allergy after PBSCT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old anciently non allergic man with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) received an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor following reduced-intensity conditioning. On day 32 after PBSCT, while still on prophylactic systemic immunosuppression, the patient noticed a first episode of angioedema with swelling of the nasal and oral mucosa 30 min after consuming peanut puffs. In a second episode, eight months after PBSCT, he again developed angioedema, generalized pruritus and nausea within minutes after eating biscuits containing hazelnut and peanut. Moreover, after topical application of a peanut oil-containing ointment, the patient experienced facial erythema and angioedema. Nine months after PBSCT an evaluation for peanut allergy revealed a highly increased specific IgE to peanut of 75.9 kU/l. Accordingly, skin prick tests for peanut extract were also positive. In consequence, the patient was counseled to strictly avoid peanut-related products, and provided with an emergency set. No adverse allergic events have occurred since for an observation time of 15 months after PBSCT. The stem cell donor was contacted and confirmed intolerance to peanuts. His specific serum IgE pattern nine month after PBSCT harvest was analysed and showed similar sensitization profiles compared to those of the transplant recipient. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the close temporal association between the onset of allergic symptoms in the PBSC recipient it is reasonable to assume that the acquired peanut allergy had been transferred from the donor to the recipient by the PBSC graft.",,"['Brauns, Birka', 'Schon, Michael P', 'Wulf, Gerald', 'Mempel, Martin']","['Brauns B', 'Schon MP', 'Wulf G', 'Mempel M']","['Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center, Georg August University Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany ; Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center, Georg August University Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany ; Lower Saxony Institute of Occupational Dermatology, University Medical Center Gottingen and University of Osnabruck, Osnabruck, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Georg August University, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center, Georg August University Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany ; Lower Saxony Institute of Occupational Dermatology, University Medical Center Gottingen and University of Osnabruck, Osnabruck, Germany ; Dermatology Office, Elmshorn, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160208,United States,World Allergy Organ J,The World Allergy Organization journal,101481283,,,,PMC4745161,['NOTNLM'],"['Allergy transfer', 'IgE-mediated hypersensitivity', 'Peanut allergy', 'Stem cell transplantation']",2016/02/24 06:00,2016/02/24 06:01,['2016/02/24 06:00'],"['2015/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40413-016-0093-4 [doi]', '93 [pii]']",epublish,World Allergy Organ J. 2016 Feb 8;9:3. doi: 10.1186/s40413-016-0093-4. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we attempt to evaluate the respiratory burst by monitoring the rapid consumption of oxygen by using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) imaging. The respiratory burst was measured in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells) derived from an acute monocytic leukemia patient under the effect of the exogenous addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which acts as a differentiation inducer. SECM imaging composed of a microelectrode was used to compare oxygen consumption between normal cellular respiration and during respiratory burst in THP-1 cells. Two-dimensional respiratory activity imaging was performed using XY-scan. In addition, the quantitative evaluation of oxygen consumption in THP-1 cells was performed using a Z-scan. The results obtained show higher consumption of oxygen in cells undergoing respiratory burst.

Stat3 upregulates pivotal transcription factors in the ES cell gene regulatory network to sustain naive identity. Stat3 also contributes to the rapid proliferation of ES cells. Here, we show that Stat3 increases the expression of mitochondrial-encoded transcripts and enhances oxidative metabolism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that Stat3 binds to the mitochondrial genome, consistent with direct transcriptional regulation. An engineered form of Stat3 that localizes predominantly to mitochondria is sufficient to support enhanced proliferation of ES cells, but not to maintain their undifferentiated phenotype. Furthermore, during reprogramming from primed to naive states of pluripotency, Stat3 similarly upregulates mitochondrial transcripts and facilitates metabolic resetting. These findings suggest that the potent stimulation of naive pluripotency by LIF/Stat3 is attributable to parallel and synergistic induction of both mitochondrial respiration and nuclear transcription factors.",['(c) 2016 The Authors.'],"['Carbognin, Elena', 'Betto, Riccardo M', 'Soriano, Maria E', 'Smith, Austin G', 'Martello, Graziano']","['Carbognin E', 'Betto RM', 'Soriano ME', 'Smith AG', 'Martello G']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK austin.smith@cscr.cam.ac.uk graziano.martello@unipd.it.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy austin.smith@cscr.cam.ac.uk graziano.martello@unipd.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160222,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Respiration', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4801951,['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'Stat3', 'metabolism', 'mitochondrial respiration', 'pluripotency']",2016/02/24 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/02/24 06:00'],"['2015/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['embj.201592629 [pii]', '10.15252/embj.201592629 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2016 Mar 15;35(6):618-34. doi: 10.15252/embj.201592629.

Tctp-deficient axons exhibit defects associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and we show that Tctp interacts in the axonal compartment with myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), a pro-survival member of the Bcl2 family. Mcl1 knockdown gives rise to similar axon misprojection phenotypes, and we provide evidence that the anti-apoptotic activity of Tctp is necessary for the normal development of the retinotectal projection. These findings suggest that Tctp supports the development of the retinotectal projection via its regulation of pro-survival signalling and axonal mitochondrial homeostasis, and establish a novel and fundamental role for Tctp in vertebrate neural circuitry assembly.",['(c) 2016.

Given that recipient APCs are essential for priming allogeneic T cells and recipient NK or T cells are able to reject allogeneic donor cells, we evaluated the role of T-bet on the host in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) using murine models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. T-bet(-/-) recipients developed significantly milder GVHD than their wild type counterparts in MHC-mismatched or CD4-dependent minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched models. Allogeneic donor T cells, in particular, CD4 subset, significantly reduced IFN-gamma production, proliferation and migration, and caused less injury in liver and gut of T-bet(-/-) recipients. We further observed that T-bet on recipient hematopoietic cells was primarily responsible for the donor T cell response and pathogenicity in GVHD. T-bet(-/-) dendritic cells expressed higher levels of Trail, whereas they produced lower levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12/23 p40, as well as chemokine CXCL9, resulting in significantly higher levels of apoptosis, less priming, and infiltration of donor T cells. Meanwhile, NK cells in T-bet(-/-) hosts partially contribute to the decreased donor T cell proliferation. Furthermore, although T-bet on hematopoietic cells was required for GVHD development, it was largely dispensable for the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Taken together with our previous findings, we propose that T-bet is a potential therapeutic target for the control of GVHD through regulating donor T cells and recipient hematopoietic cells.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Fu, Jianing', 'Wu, Yongxia', 'Nguyen, Hung', 'Heinrichs, Jessica', 'Schutt, Steven', 'Liu, Yuejun', 'Liu, Chen', 'Jin, Junfei', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong']","['Fu J', 'Wu Y', 'Nguyen H', 'Heinrichs J', 'Schutt S', 'Liu Y', 'Liu C', 'Jin J', 'Anasetti C', 'Yu XZ']","['Cancer Biology Ph.D. Program, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612; Department of Immunology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

However, the production of viable particles for gene therapy is hampered by the low ratio of infectious to non-infectious viral particles after purification, low titers and limited number of competent viral receptors. We have developed de novo two fully synthetic triazine-based ligands that can selectively bind retroviral particles pseudotyped with amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope (AMPHO4070A). A 78-membered library of triazine-based ligands was designed in silico and was virtually screened against the modeled structure of the AMPHO4070A protein. Ligands displaying the highest energy of binding were synthesized on cross-linked agarose and experimentally tested. Adsorbents containing ligands A5A10 and A10A11 showed selectivity toward viral particles containing the target protein (VLP-AMPHO), binding 19 +/- 5 mug/g support and 47 +/- 13 mug/g support, respectively. The elution conditions for both ligands were mild and with high recovery yields (80-100%), in comparison with common purification practices. These results were based on a lab-scale experimental setting with VLP integrity being confirmed through TEM. In particular, the elution buffer containing 12 mM imidazole allowed the recovery of intact amphotropic viral particles.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal treatment and the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) are unclear. Most prior case series include only modest numbers of patients who underwent transplantation. We analyzed the outcome of 95 carefully characterized alloHCT patients with MPAL reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research between 1996 and 2012. The median age was 20 years (range, 1 to 68). Among the 95 patients, 78 were in first complete remission (CR1) and 17 were in second complete remission (CR2). Three-year overall survival (OS) of 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57 to 76), leukemia-free survival of 56% (95% CI, 46 to 66), relapse incidence of 29% (95% CI, 20 to 38), and nonrelapse mortality of 15% (95% CI, 9 to 23) were encouraging. OS was best in younger patients (<20 years), but no significant differences were observed between those 20 to 40 years of age and those who were 40 years or older. A matched-pair analysis showed similar outcomes comparing MPAL cases to 375 acute myelogenous leukemia or 359 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. MPAL patients had more acute and a trend for more chronic graft-versus-host disease. No difference was observed between patients who underwent transplantation in CR1 versus those who underwent transplantation in CR2. AlloHCT is a promising treatment option for pediatric and adult patients with MPAL with encouraging long-term survival.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Constitutively active FLT3-ITD promotes the expansion of transformed progenitors, but also has pleiotropic effects on hematopoiesis. We analyzed the effect of FLT3-ITD on dendritic cells (DCs), which express FLT3 and can be expanded by FLT3L administration. Pre-leukemic mice with the Flt3(ITD) knock-in allele manifested an expansion of classical DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs. The expansion originated in DC progenitors, was cell intrinsic, and was further enhanced in Flt3(ITD/ITD) mice. The mutation caused the down-regulation of Flt3 on the surface of DCs and reduced their responsiveness to Flt3L. Both canonical Batf3-dependent CD8(+) cDCs and noncanonical CD8(+) cDCs were expanded and showed specific alterations in their expression profiles. Flt3(ITD) mice showed enhanced capacity to support T cell proliferation, including a cell-extrinsic expansion of regulatory T (T reg) cells. Accordingly, these mice restricted alloreactive T cell responses during graft-versus-host reaction, but failed to control autoimmunity without T reg cells. Thus, the FLT3-ITD mutation directly affects DC development, indirectly modulating T cell homeostasis and supporting T reg cell expansion. We hypothesize that this effect of FLT3-ITD might subvert immunosurveillance and promote leukemogenesis in a cell-extrinsic manner.",['(c) 2016 Lau et al.'],"['Lau, Colleen M', 'Nish, Simone A', 'Yogev, Nir', 'Waisman, Ari', 'Reiner, Steven L', 'Reizis, Boris']","['Lau CM', 'Nish SA', 'Yogev N', 'Waisman A', 'Reiner SL', 'Reizis B']","['Department of Pathology, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY 10016 Department of Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY 10016 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University of Mainz, Mainz 55131, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University of Mainz, Mainz 55131, Germany.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY 10016 Department of Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY 10016 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 Boris.Reizis@nyumc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160222,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeostasis', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC4813676,,,2016/02/24 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/02/24 06:00'],"['2015/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20150642 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20150642 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2016 Mar 7;213(3):415-31. doi: 10.1084/jem.20150642.

Nonetheless, there is the lack of studies dealing with VD supplementation and its impact on chemokines in CLL patients. AIM: The primary endpoint of our interventional study was to evaluate the effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on serum chemokines levels in CLL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen subjects with CLL were enrolled for the study. Six-month-long cholecalciferol supplementation was performed in CLL patients with serum 25-OH-D3 levels below 30 ng/ml. Cytokines levels were assessed at the beginning of the study and after 6 months. Baseline measurements of cytokines were compared to those in apparently healthy controls. RESULTS: Increased levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL8, CXCL10, TNFalpha, bFGF, G-CSF, and VEGF were found in CLL patients in comparison with the healthy controls. In the course of the VD supplementation a decrease in serum levels of chemokines CCL11, CCL3, and cytokine PDGF-BB was observed. The decrease of CCL11 was found in CLL patients on VD supplementation solely, whereas the decrease of CCL3 and PDGF-BB was observed in CLL subjects on both chemotherapy and VD supplementation.

Among the kinases, Abelson Leukaemia (Abl), sarcoma (Src), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endotelhial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) are considered as primary molecular targets for selective inhibition and the best successful targeted therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been achieved in the treatment of Bcr (break point cluster)-Abl leukemia. The majority of type 1 kinase inhibitors target the active conformation of ATP binding site. In consequence of intensive studies on kinases, type 2, type 3 (allosteric) and type 4 (covalent) inhibitors have been discovered beyond the type 1 inhibitors. Although the selectivity is a major problem for type 1 inhibitors, these new type of inhibitors are promising for finding new selective compounds, which may provide other therapeutic options for cancer therapy. They may also be a solution to overcome drug resistance that remains unresolved yet. Threedimensional structural determination provides the development of specific and highly binding properties of compounds. Studying the prediction of a binding mode of inhibitors, homology model developments from kinase- ligand co-crystal structures and isosteric replacements have been used to improve binding properties of inhibitors. In this review, critical results related to the design strategies of kinase specifically targeted to Src and Bcr-Abl kinases and therapeutic potential of novel inhibitors will be evaluated. The readers will be endowed with the functional role of Src and Bcr-Abl kinases that lead inhibitor design, the structural analysis of binding modes of kinase inhibitors, the current progress in terms of therapeutic interventions and the mission of leading groups in the field.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Olgen, Sureyya']",['Olgen S'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Biruni University, 10.

METHODS: Case-control study in which all pediatric patients (0-18 years) who underwent allo-HSCT from September 2009 to January 2014 were followed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent an allo-HSCT. The median age was 9 years (range = 6 months to 15 years), 61% male. The primary diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (72.4%). Six (20.7%) developed HC-BKV. In a multivariate analysis of risk factors, it was observed that the reactivation of BK virus was associated with age more than 10 years ( P = .098) and those with positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus ( P = .06). Five of the 6 patients with HC-BKV received cidofovir (CDV) at doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg/week. The treatment lasted a median of 3 cycles (range = 2-5). One of the patients (20%) developed nephrotoxicity. Of the 5 patients treated with CDV, 3 (60%) had a complete response, 1 (20%) partial response, and 1 (20%) no response. CONCLUSION: We conclude that HC-BKV is a frequent complication after allo-HSCT.

This study aimed to ( a) determine the prevalence and risk factors for abnormal brain MRI and ( b) determine prevalence and risk factors for development of new NC during and 2 years post-HCT. Retrospective chart review included 102 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2000 and 2009 at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Children's Hospital and included standard HCT data, brain MRI reports, and NC and symptoms pre- and post-HCT. Forty-three percent of patients had abnormal findings on pre-MRI, most commonly nonspecific white matter changes. Neurologic symptoms pre-HCT was the only significant risk factor for abnormal MRI. Eleven patients (11%) developed post-HCT NC. Non-Caucasian race was the only significant risk factor for new NC. Although abnormal pre-HCT brain MRI is common, these findings are not predictive of subsequent NC post-HCT. Therefore routine surveillance may not be informative for that purpose, particularly when general anesthesia is required, which can have detrimental neurocognitive effects.

The histone methyltransferase complex components (WDR5, Ash2, and menin, but not CXCC1 or NCOA6) were down-regulated at the promoter loci of Wnt target genes after Pygo2 knockdown, and this was accompanied by the down-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activity. Further, we demonstrated that the involvement of Pygo2 in the activation of the Wnt pathway in human glioma progression is through up-regulation of the H3K4me3 (but not H3K4me2) by promoting the recruitment of the histone methyltransferase MLL1/MLL2 complex to Wnt target gene promoters.

In this study, we showed evidence that chaetominine has cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on human leukemia K562 cells and investigated the pathway involved in chaetominine-induced apoptosis in detail. Chaetominine inhibited K562 cell growth, with an IC50 value of 35 nM, but showed little inhibitory effect on the growth of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The high apoptosis rates, morphological apoptotic features, and DNA fragmentation caused by chaetominine indicated that the cytotoxicity was partially caused by its pro-apoptotic effect. Under chaetominine treatment, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was upregulated (from 0.3 to 8), which was followed by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and stimulation of Apaf-1.

The expression of RUNX1 gene is controlled by two promoters; the distal P1 promoter and the proximal P2 promoter. Several isoforms of RUNX1 mRNA are generated through the use of both promoters and alternative splicing. These isoforms not only differs in their temporal expression pattern but also exhibit differences in tissue specificity. The RUNX1 isoforms derived from P2 are expressed in a variety of tissues, but expression of P1-derived isoform is restricted to cells of hematopoietic lineage. However, the control of hematopoietic-cell specific expression is poorly understood. Here we report regulation of P1-derived RUNX1 mRNA by RUNX1 protein. In silico analysis of P1 promoter revealed presence of two evolutionary conserved RUNX motifs, 0.6kb upstream of the transcription start site, and three RUNX motifs within 170bp of the 5'UTR. Transcriptional contribution of these RUNX motifs was studied in myeloid and T-cells. RUNX1 genomic fragment containing all sites show very low basal activity in both cell types. Mutation or deletion of RUNX motifs in the UTR enhances basal activity of the RUNX1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that RUNX1 protein is recruited to these sites. Overexpression of RUNX1 in non-hematopoietic cells results in a dose dependent activation of the RUNX1 P1 promoter. We also demonstrate that RUNX1 protein regulates transcription of endogenous RUNX1 mRNA in T-cell. Finally we show that SCL transcription factor is recruited to regions containing RUNX motifs in the promoter and the UTR and regulates activity of the RUNX1 P1 promoter in vitro. Thus, multiple lines of evidence show that RUNX1 protein regulates its own gene transcription.",,"['Martinez, Milka', 'Hinojosa, Marcela', 'Trombly, Daniel', 'Morin, Violeta', 'Stein, Janet', 'Stein, Gary', 'Javed, Amjad', 'Gutierrez, Soraya E']","['Martinez M', 'Hinojosa M', 'Trombly D', 'Morin V', 'Stein J', 'Stein G', 'Javed A', 'Gutierrez SE']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, 01655, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, 01655, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, 89 Beaumont Avenue, Burlington 05405, Vermont, United States of America.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, 01655, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, 89 Beaumont Avenue, Burlington 05405, Vermont, United States of America.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160222,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotide Motifs', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sequence Alignment', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",PMC4762634,,,2016/02/24 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/02/23 06:00'],"['2015/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0149119 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-33579 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Feb 22;11(2):e0149119. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0149119. eCollection 2016.,,"['R01 AG030228/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR062091/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AR062091/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously developed and described 2 human pancreatic beta cell lines (EndoC-betaH1 and EndoC-betaH2) that were generated in this way. Here, we have shown that B10 xenotropic virus 1 (Bxv1), a xenotropic endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV), is present in these 2 recently described cell lines. We determined that Bxv1 was also present in SCID mice that were used for in vivo propagation of EndoC-betaH1/2 cells, suggesting that contamination occurred during xenotransplantation. EndoC-betaH1/2 cells released Bxv1 particles that propagated to human 293T and Mus dunni cells. Mobilization assays demonstrated that Bxv1 transcomplements defective MuLV-based retrovectors. In contrast, common rodent beta cell lines, rat INS-1E and RIN-5F cells and mouse MIN6 and betaTC3 cells, displayed either no or extremely weak xenotropic helper activity toward MuLV-based retrovectors, although xenotropic retrovirus sequences and transcripts were detected in both mouse cell lines. Bxv1 propagation from EndoC-betaH1/2 to 293T cells occurred only under optimized conditions and was overall poorly efficient. Thus, although our data imply that MuLV-based retrovectors should be cautiously used in EndoC-betaH1/2 cells, our results indicate that an involuntary propagation of Bxv1 from these cells can be easily avoided with good laboratory practices.",,"['Kirkegaard, Jeannette S', 'Ravassard, Philippe', 'Ingvarsen, Signe', 'Diedisheim, Marc', 'Bricout-Neveu, Emilie', 'Gronborg, Mads', 'Frogne, Thomas', 'Scharfmann, Raphael', 'Madsen, Ole D', 'Rescan, Claude', 'Albagli, Olivier']","['Kirkegaard JS', 'Ravassard P', 'Ingvarsen S', 'Diedisheim M', 'Bricout-Neveu E', 'Gronborg M', 'Frogne T', 'Scharfmann R', 'Madsen OD', 'Rescan C', 'Albagli O']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160222,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome, Viral', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Rats', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Replication', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4767346,,,2016/02/24 06:00,2016/07/21 06:00,['2016/02/23 06:00'],"['2015/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['83573 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI83573 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Mar 1;126(3):1109-13. doi: 10.1172/JCI83573.

Angiopoietin 1 (Ang 1) is an angiogenic cytokine which is essential in survival and proliferation of endothelial cells. Angiopoietin 2 (Ang 2) promotes dissociation of pericytes and increases vascular permeability and stromal derived factor 1 alpha (SDF 1alpha) which is a key player in stem cell traffic in the bone marrow (BM), has stimulating effects on angiogenesis as well. Here, we investigated the role of the leukemic BM microenvironment and specifically, the role of SDF 1alpha-CXCR4 and Ang 1/Ang 2-Tie 2 axes. METHODS: Here, Ang 1, Ang 2, and SDF 1alpha levels were measured in the BM plasma and in supernatants of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) of patients with ALL and compared with those of healthy controls. RESULTS: The results showed that at diagnosis, BM plasma levels of Ang 1 and SDF 1alpha were significantly low and Ang 2 was high when compared to control values. Remission induction was associated with an increase in Ang 1/Ang 2 ratio and SDF levels in BM plasma. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that BM microenvironment and leukemic cell-stroma interaction influences the secretion of Ang 1, 2 and SDF 1alpha, thus, may affect both angiogenesis, homing and mobilization of leukemic blasts.",,"['Karakurt, Neslihan', 'Aksu, Tekin', 'Koksal, Yasin', 'Yarali, Nese', 'Tunc, Bahattin', 'Uckan-Cetinkaya, Duygu', 'Ozguner, Meltem']","['Karakurt N', 'Aksu T', 'Koksal Y', 'Yarali N', 'Tunc B', 'Uckan-Cetinkaya D', 'Ozguner M']","[""a Deparment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , Ankara Childrens' Hematology/Oncology Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey."", ""a Deparment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , Ankara Childrens' Hematology/Oncology Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey."", ""b Deparment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Stem Cell Laboratory , Ankara Childrens' Hematology/Oncology Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey."", ""a Deparment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , Ankara Childrens' Hematology/Oncology Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey."", ""a Deparment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , Ankara Childrens' Hematology/Oncology Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey."", ""c Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation , Hacettepe School of Medicine Ihsan Dogramaci Childrens' Hospital , Ankara , Turkey."", ""b Deparment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Stem Cell Laboratory , Ankara Childrens' Hematology/Oncology Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160301,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (Angiopoietins)'],IM,"['Angiopoietins/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Ang 1/Ang 2 ratio', 'Angiopoietins', 'Bone marrow microenvironment', 'Children', 'SDF 1alpha']",2016/02/24 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2016/02/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.2015.1125078 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Jul;21(6):325-31. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2015.1125078.

It is therefore postulated that applying clinical trial regimens in a non-clinical trial setting yield similar outcomes. The aim of the present study was to explore this hypothesis in the context of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in our institution. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 224 consecutive pediatric ALL cases treated between January 2001 and December 2007. Standard-risk (SR) patients were treated on CCG-1991 (regimen OD) while high-risk (HR) patients were treated on CCG-1961 (regimen D). Results were compared with those of the equivalent regimen in the original clinical trials. Statistical analysis was carried using chi-square or Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. RESULTS: Comparison of treatment outcomes revealed that SR patients had inferior 5-year overall survival (OS) of (89.0 +/- 2.9 vs. 96.0% +/- 0.9%); event-free survival of (82.3 +/- 3.5 vs. 88.7% +/- 1.4%); and relapse rate of (15.8 vs. 9.3% (P = 0.034)) compared to patients treated in the clinical trial. However, no statistically significant difference in treatment outcomes was observed between HR patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite using comparable regimens, suboptimal outcomes were noted in SR patients implying that similar treatments do not necessarily yield similar outcomes. This underscores the need to evaluate outcomes of adapted regimens to identify areas that need further improvement in centers not enrolling patients on prospective collaborative clinical trials.",,"['Jastaniah, Wasil', 'Elimam, Naglla', 'Abdalla, Khalid', 'Felimban, Sami', 'Abrar, Mohammed Burhan']","['Jastaniah W', 'Elimam N', 'Abdalla K', 'Felimban S', 'Abrar MB']","['a Princess Noorah Oncology Center , King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine , Umm AlQura University , Makkah , Saudi Arabia.', 'a Princess Noorah Oncology Center , King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'a Princess Noorah Oncology Center , King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'a Princess Noorah Oncology Center , King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'a Princess Noorah Oncology Center , King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160224,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*CCG', '*COG', '*Child', '*Leukemia', '*Regimen']",2016/02/24 06:00,2017/03/04 06:00,['2016/02/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.2015.1101974 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Apr;21(3):175-81. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2015.1101974.

Four sesquiterpene lactones, artecanin (1), 3beta-chloro-4alpha,10alpha-dihydroxy-1alpha,2alpha-epoxy-5alpha,7alphaH-guaia-11 (13)-en-12,6alpha-olide (2), iso-seco-tanapartholide 3-O-methyl ether (3) and 4beta,15-dihydro-3-dehydrozaluzanin C (4), were isolated from two traditionally used Asteraceae species (Onopordum acanthium and Artemisia asiatica). When tested for antiproliferative action on HL-60 leukemia cells, these compounds exhibited reasonable IC50 values in the range 3.6-13.5 muM. Treatment with the tested compounds resulted in a cell cycle disturbance characterized by increases in the G1 and G2/M populations, while there was a decrease in the S phase. Additionally, 1-3 elicited increases in the hypodiploid (subG1) population. The compounds elicited concentration-dependent chromatin condensation and disruption of the membrane integrity, as revealed by Hoechst 33258-propidium staining. Treatment for 24 h resulted in significant increases in activity of caspases-3 and -9, indicating that the tested sesquiterpenes induced the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

Twenty-five of the 37 (68%) patients had response in hemoglobin level (n = 25), platelet count (n = 21), and/or absolute neutrophil count (n = 13). The median rise in hemoglobin was 6.5 mg/dL, platelet count 70,000/mm(3), and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1530/muL. The majority of patients (n = 22) had a response in 2 or more blood parameters.

Since high level of cisplatin is cytotoxic to both cancer and normal cells, the goal of the present study was to explore the effectiveness of prolonged low doses of cisplatin in the management of leukemia. To achieve our goal, human leukemia (HL-60) cells were treated with different doses (1, 2, or 3 microM) of cisplatin for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Cell viability was assessed by MTS assay. Both oxidative stress damage and genotoxicity were estimated by antioxidants, lipid peroxidation, and comet assays, respectively. Data obtained from the MTS assay demonstrated that cisplatin treatment decreased the number of viable tumor cells by direct cell killing or by simply decreasing the rate of cellular proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The results of the lipid peroxidation showed a significant increase (p<0.05) of malondialdehyde levels with increasing cisplatin doses. Results obtained from super oxide dismutase and catalase assays showed a gradual increase in antioxidant enzyme activity in cisplatin-treated cells compared to control cells. Data generated from the Comet assay demonstrated a significant dose-dependent increase in genotoxicity with respect to DNA damage as a result of cisplatin treatment. Taken together, our research demonstrated that cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells is mediated at least in part via induction of oxidative stress and oxidative damage.",,"['Dasari, Shaloam R', 'Velma, Venkatramreddy', 'Yedjou, Clement G', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Dasari SR', 'Velma V', 'Yedjou CG', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box 18750, Jackson, MS 39217, USA.', 'Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box 18750, Jackson, MS 39217, USA.', 'Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box 18750, Jackson, MS 39217, USA.', 'Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box 18750, Jackson, MS 39217, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151015,United States,Int J Cancer Res Mol Mech,International journal of cancer research and molecular mechanisms,101671021,,,,PMC4758698,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell viability', 'Cisplatin', 'HL-60 cells', 'Oxidative damage', 'Oxidative stress']",2016/02/24 06:00,2016/02/24 06:01,['2016/02/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.16966/2381-3318.113 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer Res Mol Mech. 2015 Oct;1(3). doi: 10.16966/2381-3318.113.

These mAbs were tested for activity and then distributed as a blinded panel to 15 international laboratories to test on different leukocyte populations. These populations included blood DCs, skin-derived DCs, tonsil leukocytes, monocyte-derived DCs, CD34-derived DCs, macrophage populations and diagnostic acute myeloid leukaemia and lymphoma samples. Each laboratory was provided with enough mAb to perform five repeat experiments. Here, we summarise the reactivity of different mAb to 68 different cell-surface molecules expressed by human myeloid and DC populations.

METHODS: Paenibacillus sp. strain VT-400 was isolated from the saliva of four children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The genome was annotated using RAST and the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline to characterize features of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. We used a mouse model of pneumonia to study virulence in vivo. Mice were challenged with 7.5 log10-9.5 log10 CFU, and survival was monitored over 7 days. Bacterial load was measured in the lungs and spleen of surviving mice 48 h post-infection to reveal bacterial invasion and dissemination. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing revealed a large number of virulence factors such as hemolysin D and CD4+ T cell-stimulating antigen. Furthermore, the strain harbors numerous antibiotic resistance genes, including small multidrug resistance proteins, which have never been previously found in the Paenibacillus genus. We then compared the presence of antibiotic resistance genes against results from antibiotic susceptibility testing. Paenibacillus sp. strain VT-400 was found to be resistant to macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin, as well as to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Finally, the isolate caused mortality in mice infected with >/=8.5 log10 CFU. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results and on the available literature, there is yet no strong evidence that shows Paenibacillus species as an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. However, the presence of spore-forming bacteria with virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in such patients warrants special attention because infections caused by spore-forming bacteria are poorly treatable.",,"['Tetz, George', 'Tetz, Victor', 'Vecherkovskaya, Maria']","['Tetz G', 'Tetz V', 'Vecherkovskaya M']","['Institute of Human Microbiology, LLC, 303 5th Avenue, Suite 2012, New York, NY 10016 USA.', 'First State I.

Its management and outcome in the oncology population is limited because it is still difficult to identify despite an increasingly recognized occurrence. This is the largest retrospective study of PRES in cancer patients reported from a single institution. We explore the clinical manifestations and radiologic features to comprehensively assess PRES in order to prevent permanent neurologic deficits and mortality. We retrospectively identified 69 patients with cancer who developed PRES at MDACC between 01/2006 to 06/2012. Clinical and radiographic data were abstracted from their records and reviewed for our analysis. Mean age at PRES onset was 52 +/- 17.8 years. Fifty-two (75 %; p < 0.001) patients were women. Most common diagnoses were leukemia (30 %) and lymphoma (12 %). Forty-eight (70 %) patients were treated with chemotherapy, 21 (30 %) bone marrow transplant and 14 (20 %) tacrolimus. Most common clinical presentation was seizures (67 %). PRES was associated with hypertension in 62 (90 %) patients. On brain MRI, 33 (44 %) patients had some evidence of hemorrhage, 22 (73 %) of these were thrombocytopenic. Thirty-five (51 %) patients fully recovered and 19 (28 %) had permanent neurological deficits. Morbidity and mortality were associated with continuation with offending agent, thrombocytopenia, variations in mean arterial pressure >/=20 mmHg, electrographic seizures at onset, atypical MRI pattern and delay in diagnostic imaging (7.4 +/- 4.8 days vs. 1.9 +/- 1.8 days; p = 0.031) as half of them did not receive a prompt intervention.

However, improvement of the efficacy of AZA treatment remains a challenge. We retrospectively tested the hypothesis that VitD levels (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) prior to start of first-line AZA therapy are predictive of overall survival (OS) in patients diagnosed with MDS and secondary oligoblastic AML. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effects of AZA in combination with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were investigated in vitro. METHODS: A total of 58 patients treated at our center between 2006 and 2014 were analyzed. Serum levels of VitD were quantified using a standard, commercially available 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 chemiluminescent immunoassay. Effects on cell proliferation were assessed using tetrazolium-based MTT assays. RESULTS: Median serum VitD level prior to AZA treatment was 32.8 nM (range 11.0-101.5 nM). Patient, disease and treatment characteristics did not differ significantly between the low (</=32.8 nM; n = 29) and high (>32.8 nM; n = 29) VitD group. Estimated probability of 2-year OS in the low versus high VitD group was 14% versus 40% (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis with OS as endpoint, adverse cytogenetics (HR 2.66, P = 0.03) and VitD (per 10 nM decrease, HR 1.68, P = 0.02) were independent predictors of worse survival. In-vitro treatment of myeloid cell lines with AZA in combination with VitD produced synergistic and additive antiproliferative effects. Addition of nanomolar VitD concentrations to AZA resulted in potentiation of AZA activity. Conversely, combination with the VitD antagonist TEI-9647 resulted in inhibition of AZA activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that higher VitD levels were associated with a survival advantage following first-line AZA therapy. Enhanced cytotoxic effects upon combination treatment may contribute to the observed clinical effects. VitD repletion/supplementation during AZA treatment should be explored.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and', 'Metabolism.

Children were between 2 and 14 years old, the mean age was 6.88+/-3.38 years. They were examined by clinical symptoms and ultrasonographic appearances. Persistent lymphadenopathies were evaluated by excisional biopsy. RESULTS: Cervical lymhadenopathies of 80 children with well clinical symptoms decreased and resolved within 10 weeks durations. Their ultrasonographic findings revealed regular margins, ovoid shapes and getting smaller than 1. 5 cm. The remaining 20 children persisting longer than 10 weeks at the same size, with worrisome clinical symptoms and susceptible ultrasonographic findings (round shapes, irregular margins) underwent excisional biopsy.

The efficiency of these analyses, particularly for infrequently mutated genes, is compromised when subjects carry different combinations of driver mutations. Mutual exclusivity analysis helps address these challenges. To identify mutually exclusive gene sets (MEGS), we developed a powerful and flexible analytic framework based on a likelihood ratio test and a model selection procedure. Extensive simulations demonstrated that our method outperformed existing methods for both statistical power and the capability of identifying the exact MEGS, particularly for highly imbalanced MEGS. Our method can be used for de novo discovery, for pathway-guided searches, or for expanding established small MEGS. We applied our method to the whole-exome sequencing data for 13 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified multiple previously unreported non-pairwise MEGS in multiple cancer types. For acute myeloid leukemia, we identified a MEGS with five genes (FLT3, IDH2, NRAS, KIT, and TP53) and a MEGS (NPM1, TP53, and RUNX1) whose mutation status was strongly associated with survival (p = 6.7 x 10(-4)). For breast cancer, we identified a significant MEGS consisting of TP53 and four infrequently mutated genes (ARID1A, AKT1, MED23, and TBL1XR1), providing support for their role as cancer drivers.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society of Human Genetics.

Although multiple studies have shown superiority of alloHCT over autologous (auto) hematopoietic cell transplantation for high-risk patients, these findings may be explained, in part, by contamination of the peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) leukapheresis product by residual leukemic cells in patients undergoing autoHCT. We retrospectively evaluated minimal residual disease (MRD) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the PBPC leukapheresis product of 32 ALL patients who underwent autoHCT. Twenty-eight patients (88%) had diagnostic samples with quantifiable immunoreceptor rearrangements to follow for MRD. Twelve (38%) patients had Ph+ B-ALL, 12 (38%) had Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) B-ALL, and 4 (14%) had T cell ALL. With a median follow-up of 41 months (range, 3 to 217), median relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival for the entire cohort were 3.2 and 4.2 years, respectively; at 5 years after transplantation, 42% of patients remain alive and relapse free. Using MRD detection at a threshold of >/= 1 x 10(-6), median RFS for patients with detectable MRD was 6.5 months and was not reached for patients without detectable disease (P = .0005). In multivariate analysis, the only factor significantly associated with relapse was the presence of MRD >/=1 x 10(-6) (odds ratio, 23.8; confidence interval, 1.8 to 312.9; P = .0158). Our findings suggest that NGS for MRD detection can predict long-term RFS in patients undergoing autoHCT for high-risk ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Remarkably, the dermis plays a dominant role in the process of skin aging. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play a role in the regulation of gene expression in organism aging. However, studies about age-related miRNAs in human skin remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To obtain an overall view of miRNAs expression in human aged dermis by comparison of dermis samples between young and elderly, construct the miRNA-gene-network and reveal the pivotal miRNAs in the regulatory network. METHODS: Human dermis tissue was obtained from 12 donors, including 6 of young group and 6 of elderly one. The miRNA microarray and data analysis were performed. Target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted, followed by a gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis. A miRNA-gene-network was then constructed, and the pivotal miRNAs in the network was revealed. Primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were isolated, and the cellular senescence was induced by serial passaging. Alteration in the expression of miRNAs between young and senescent fibroblasts was evaluated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. MiR-34b-5p mimics were transfected into primary HDFs. Subsequent cell cycle analysis was performed and expression level of COL1A1, elastin and MMP-1 were evaluated. RESULTS: The expression of a total of 40 miRNAs (25 upregulated and 15 downregulated) was found to be significantly altered in aged dermis compared with young dermis. Real-time quantitative PCR results confirmed the differential expression of miR-34 family and miR-29 family between young and aged dermis. A computational approach demonstrated that predicted target genes of the miRNA profile were found to be mainly involved in processes including cell adhesion, collagen synthesis, positive or negative regulation of transcription, as well as pathways such as insulin signaling pathway, ErbB (Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog) signaling pathway and Focal adhesion pathway. The miRNA-Gene-Network revealed that miR-34 family, miR-29 family and miR-424 may play a dominant role in the regulatory network. A similar miRNA alteration was observed in senescent fibroblasts in vitro, and the age-related miRNA profile may interact with p16 pathway to regulate the fibroblasts' senescence. Additionally, transfection of miR-34b-5p mimics induced cell cycle arrest in HDFs, decreased the expression of both COL1A1 and elastin and increased MMP-1 expression. CONCLUSION: The miR-34 family and miR-29 family expressed differentially in young and aged dermis. MiR-34 in HDFs modulated the cell function and expression of MMP-1, COL1A1 and elastin. The miRNAs may play critical roles in affecting dermis aging.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The objective is to clarify their putative prognostic and predictive effects. METHODS: A pooled analysis of TP53 mutations (exons 5-8) was conducted in four randomized trials (the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial, J BRonchus 10, Cancer and Leukemia Group B-9633, and Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association trial) of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) versus observation (OBS). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mutant versus wild-type (WT) TP53 for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using a multivariable Cox model stratified on trial and adjusted on sex, age, and clinicopathological variables. Predictive value was evaluated with an interaction between treatment and TP53. RESULTS: A total of 1209 patients (median follow-up 5.5 years) were included. There were 573 deaths (47%) and 653 DFS events (54%). Mutations (434 [36%]) had no prognostic effect (OBS HROS = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.77-1.28, p = 0.95; HRDFS = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.78-1.25, p = 0.92) but were marginally predictive of benefit from ACT for OS (test for interaction: OS, p = 0.06; DFS, p = 0.11). Patients with WT TP53 had a tendency toward better outcomes with ACT than did those in the OBS group (HROS = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.95, p = 0.02; HRDFS = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92, p = 0.005). In the ACT arm, a deleterious effect of mutant versus WT TP53 was observed (HROS = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.10-1.78, p = 0.006; HRDFS = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.64, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutation had no prognostic effect but was marginally predictive for survival from ACT.

Several reports bring evidences that B-1 cells are the main cell population in the chronic lymphatic leukemia. It is also described that these cells have an important involvement in the lupus erythematous systemic. The murine model used to investigate both disease models is NZB/NZW. Data from literature point that mutation in micro-RNA 15a and 16 are the responsible for the B-1 hyperplasia in these mice. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that NZB/NZW B-1 cells are radioresistant, contrariwise to observe in other mouse lineage derived B-1 cells and B-2 cells. However, some reports bring evidences that a small percentage of B-1 cells in healthy mice are also able to survive to irradiation. Herein, we aim to investigate the malignant potential of ionizing-radiation resistant B-1 cells in vitro. Our main goal is to establish a model that mimics the neoplastic transformation originate to a damage exposure of DNA, and not only related to intrinsic mutations. Data shown here demonstrated that radiation-resistant B-1 cells were able to survive long periods in culture. Further, these cells show proliferation index increase in relation to non-irradiated B-1 cells. In addition, radiation resistant B-1 cells showed hyperploid, morphologic alterations, increased induction of apoptosis after anti-IgM stimulation. Based on these results, we could suggest that radiation resistant B-1 cells showed some modifications in that could be related to induction of malignant potential.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

The MSI2 RNA-binding protein has been demonstrated to have a role in acute myeloid leukaemia and stem cell function, but its role in MDS is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that elevated MSI2 expression correlates with poor survival in MDS. Conditional deletion of Msi2 in a mouse model of MDS results in a rapid loss of MDS haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and reverses the clinical features of MDS. Inversely, inducible overexpression of MSI2 drives myeloid disease progression. The MDS HSPCs remain dependent on MSI2 expression after disease initiation. Furthermore, MSI2 expression expands and maintains a more activated (G1) MDS HSPC.

However, the mechanisms which hypoxia causes mitochondrial dysfunction and energy metabolism misbalance still remain unclear. In this study, we presented evidence that mitochondrial phosphatase Ptpmt1 is a hypoxia response molecule that regulates cell proliferation, survival and glucose metabolism in human erythroleukemia TF-1 cells. Exposure to hypoxia or DFO treatment results in upregulation of HIF1-alpha, HIF-2alpha and Ptpmt1. Only inhibition of HIF-2alpha by shRNA transduction reduces Ptpmt1 expression in TF-1 cells under hypoxia. Ptpmt1 inhibitor suppresses the growth and induces apoptosis of TF-1 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ptpmt1 inhibition reduces the Glut1 and Glut3 expression and decreases the glucose consumption in TF-1 cells. In additional, Ptpmt1 knockdown also results in the mitochondrial dysfunction determined by JC1 staining. These results delineate a key role for HIF-2alpha-induced Ptpmt1 upregulation in proliferation, survival and glucose metabolism of erythroleukemia cells.

Blood vessels may serve as sanctuary sites for AML. When AML cells were co-cultured with bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs), a greater proportion of leukemia cells were in G0/G1. This led us to a strategy of targeting BMECs with tubulin-binding combretastatins, causing BMECs to lose their flat phenotype, degrade their cytoskeleton, cease growth, and impair migration despite unchanged BMEC viability and metabolism. Combretastatins also caused downregulation of BMEC adhesion molecules known to tether AML cells, including vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. When AML-BMEC co-cultures were treated with combretastatins, a significantly greater proportion of AML cells dislodged from BMECs and entered the G2/M cell cycle, suggesting enhanced susceptibility to cell cycle agents. Indeed, the combination of combretastatins and cytotoxic chemotherapy enhanced additive AML cell death. In vivo mice xenograft studies confirmed this finding by revealing complete AML regression after treatment with combretastatins and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Beyond highlighting the pathologic role of BMECs in the leukemia microenvironment as a protective reservoir of disease, these results support a new strategy for using vascular-targeting combretastatins in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy to treat AML.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In drug resistant CML cells, HO-1 expression abnormally increased and that of autophagy-related protein LC-3I/II also increased, so we herein postulated HO-1 was associated with autophagy. HO-1 expressions in IM-sensitive/resistant K562/K562R cells were regulated through lentiviral mediation. K562 cells transfected with HO-1 resisted IM and underwent obvious autophagy. After HO-1 expression was silenced in K562R cells, autophagy was inhibited and the sensitivity to IM was increased. The findings were related with the inhibitory effects of high HO-1 expression on the mTOR signaling pathway that negatively regulated autophagy. High HO-1 expression promoted autophagy by inhibiting mTOR. Similar to the cell line results, mononuclear cells of IM-resistant CML patients became significantly sensitive to IM when HO-1 expression was inhibited.

Growing evidence has highlighted them to be essential regulators of human embryonic stem cell differentiation. SENCR, a vascular-enriched long noncoding RNA, overlaps the Friend Leukemia Integration virus 1 (FLI1) gene, a regulator of endothelial development. Therefore, we wanted to test the hypothesis that SENCR may contribute to mesodermal and endothelial commitment as well as in endothelial function. We thus developed new differentiation protocols allowing generation of endothelial cells from human embryonic stem cells using both directed and hemogenic routes. The expression of SENCR was markedly regulated during endothelial commitment using both protocols. SENCR did not control the pluripotency of pluripotent cells; however its overexpression significantly potentiated early mesodermal and endothelial commitment. In human umbilical endothelial cell (HUVEC), SENCR induced proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. SENCR expression was altered in vascular tissue and cells derived from patients with critical limb ischemia and premature coronary artery disease compared to controls.

Because of the significant late sequelae of CNS treatment, early identification of patients at risk of CNS relapse is crucial. Using microarray-analysis, we discovered multiple differentially expressed genes between B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cells in bone marrow (BM) and BCP-ALL cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the time of isolated CNS relapse. After confirmation by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, selected genes (including SCD and SPP1) were validated at the protein level by flowcytometric analysis of BCP-ALL cells in CSF. Further flowcytometric validation showed that a subpopulation of BCP-ALL cells (>1%) with a 'CNS protein profile' (SCD positivity and increased SPP1 expression) was present in the BM at diagnosis in patients who later developed an isolated CNS relapse, whereas this subpopulation was <1% or absent in all other patients. These data indicate that the presence of a (small) subpopulation of BCP-ALL cells with a 'CNS protein profile' at diagnosis (particularly SCD-positivity) is associated with isolated CNS relapse.

In mice, MSC inhibit activation and proliferation of endothelial cells in remote inflamed lymph nodes (LNs), affect elongation and arborization of high endothelial venules (HEVs) and inhibit T-cell homing. The proteomic analysis of the MSC secretome identified the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) as a potential effector molecule responsible for the anti-angiogenic properties of MSC. Both in vitro and in vivo, TIMP-1 activity is responsible for the anti-angiogenic effects of MSC, and increasing TIMP-1 concentrations delivered by an Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) vector recapitulates the effects of MSC transplantation on draining LNs. Thus, this study discovers a new and highly efficient general mechanism through which MSC tune down immunity and inflammation, identifies TIMP-1 as a novel biomarker of MSC-based therapy and opens the gate to new therapeutic approaches of inflammatory diseases.",,"['Zanotti, L', 'Angioni, R', 'Cali, B', 'Soldani, C', 'Ploia, C', 'Moalli, F', 'Gargesha, M', ""D'Amico, G"", 'Elliman, S', 'Tedeschi, G', 'Maffioli, E', 'Negri, A', 'Zacchigna, S', 'Sarukhan, A', 'Stein, J V', 'Viola, A']","['Zanotti L', 'Angioni R', 'Cali B', 'Soldani C', 'Ploia C', 'Moalli F', 'Gargesha M', ""D'Amico G"", 'Elliman S', 'Tedeschi G', 'Maffioli E', 'Negri A', 'Zacchigna S', 'Sarukhan A', 'Stein JV', 'Viola A']","['Humanitas Clinical and Research Institute, IRCCS, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'University of Padua, Italy, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'University of Padua, Italy, Switzerland.', 'Humanitas Clinical and Research Institute, IRCCS, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', 'Humanitas Clinical and Research Institute, IRCCS, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', 'Theodor Kocher Institute, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'BioInVision Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA.', ""Centro Ricerca 'M.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies appear promising but on-target, off-tumor recognition of antigen in healthy tissues remains a concern. Here we isolated a high-affinity (HA) folate receptor beta (FRbeta)-specific single-chain variable fragment (2.48 nm KD) for optimization of FRbeta-redirected CAR T-cell therapy for AML. T cells stably expressing the HA-FRbeta CAR exhibited greatly enhanced antitumor activity against FRbeta(+) AML in vitro and in vivo compared with a low-affinity FRbeta CAR (54.3 nm KD). Using the HA-FRbeta immunoglobulin G, FRbeta expression was detectable in myeloid-lineage hematopoietic cells; however, expression in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) was nearly undetectable. Accordingly, HA-FRbeta CAR T cells lysed mature CD14(+) monocytes, while HSC colony formation was unaffected. Because of the potential for elimination of mature myeloid lineage, mRNA CAR electroporation for transient CAR expression was evaluated. mRNA-electroporated HA-FRbeta CAR T cells retained effective antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Together, our results highlight the importance of antibody affinity in target protein detection and CAR development and suggest that transient delivery of potent HA-FRbeta CAR T cells is highly effective against AML and reduces the risk for long-term myeloid toxicity.",,"['Lynn, R C', 'Feng, Y', 'Schutsky, K', 'Poussin, M', 'Kalota, A', 'Dimitrov, D S', 'Powell, D J Jr']","['Lynn RC', 'Feng Y', 'Schutsky K', 'Poussin M', 'Kalota A', 'Dimitrov DS', 'Powell DJ Jr']","['Ovarian Cancer Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Protein Interactions Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Ovarian Cancer Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Ovarian Cancer Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Protein Interactions Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Ovarian Cancer Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160222,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (FOLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Folate Receptor 2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Folate Receptor 2/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Monocytes', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Single-Chain Antibodies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",PMC4889499,,,2016/02/24 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/02/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201635 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.35 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Jun;30(6):1355-64. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.35.

Here, we employed multiplex cytokine profiling of plasma samples to test newly diagnosed CP-CML patients who subsequently received imatinib treatment. A wide range of pro-inflammatory and angiogenesis-promoting cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were elevated in the plasma of CML patients compared with that of healthy donors. Most of these normalized after tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment while others remained high in remission samples. Importantly, we identified TGF-alpha and IL-6 as novel biomarkers with high diagnostic plasma levels strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve EMR and deep molecular response, as well as transformation to blast crisis and event-free survival. Interestingly, high TGF-alpha alone can also delineate a poor response group raising the possibility of a pathogenic role.

In B-cell malignancies, its role was well explored; its expression was shown to be connected with disease prognosis in certain B-non Hodgkin lymphomas. In this study, 16 bone marrow trephine samples from patients with no hematopoietic malignancies and 10 samples from peripheral blood of healthy individuals were immunostained with anti-FOXP1 antibody. Positive cells in bone marrows were not only lymphocytes, but also cells that are immunohistochemically positive for glycophorin C or myeloperoxidase. Peripheral blood samples showed no other positive cells, but small round lymphocytes. Additionally 60 samples from patients with myeloid lineage neoplasms were analyzed. 25 samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 35 patients with myeloproliferative disease (MPD) were double immunostained with anti-FOXP1/anti-glycophorin C and anti-FOXP1/anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies. FOXP1 was found to be expressed in 22 cases of MDS and in none of MPD cases. Its expression in MDS was observed mostly in myeloperoxidase positive cells in contrast to gylcophorin C positive cells. Only two cases revealed both myeloperoxidase positive cells and gylcophorin C positive cells expressing FOXP1 transcription factor.

According to the lineage origin, two major leukemias can be distinguished: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). Although the survival rate for pediatric ALL is close to 90%, half of the young adults with AML or ALL and approximately 90% of older patients with AML or ALL still die of their disease, raising the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. As almost all leukemic blasts express specific surface antigens, targeted immunotherapy appears to be particularly promising. However, published results of immunotherapy alone are generally modest. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) brings additional therapeutic mechanisms using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed to tumor antigens, thus adding radiobiological cytotoxicity to immunologic cytotoxicity. Because of the high radiosensitivity of tumor cells and the diffuse widespread nature of the disease, making it rapidly accessible to circulating radiolabeled mAbs, acute leukemias represent relevant indications for RIT. With the development of recombinant and humanized mAbs, innovative radionuclides, and more efficient radiolabeling and pretargeting techniques, RIT has significantly improved over the last 10 years. Different approaches of alpha and beta RIT targeting CD22, CD33, CD45, or CD66 antigens have already been evaluated or are currently being developed in the treatment of acute leukemia.

The current study aimed at investigating the neuroprotective effect of nanodiamond (ND), adamantine-based nanoparticles, in aluminum-induced cognitive impairment in rats, an experimental model of AD. AD was induced by aluminum chloride (17 mg/kg, p.o. for 6 weeks) and confirmed by Morris water maze and Y-maze behavioral tests. Biochemical and histological analyses of the hippocampus were also performed. Aluminum-treated rats showed behavioral, biochemical, and histological changes similar to those associated with AD. ND improved learning and memory and reversed histological alterations. At the molecular levels, ND mitigated the increase of hippocampal beta-amyloid (Abeta42) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) together with down-regulation of phosphorylated tau protein. It also modulated the excitatory glutamate neurotransmitter level. Furthermore, ND boosted the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitochondrial transcription factor-A (TFAM), suppressed the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and curbed oxidative stress by hampering of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Moreover, ND augmented the hippocampal levels of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (p-STAT3) and B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) anti-apoptotic protein while diminished nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and caspase-3 (casp-3) expression. These findings indicate the protective effect of ND against memory deficits and AD-like pathological aberrations probably via modulating NF-kB and STAT3 signaling, effects mediated likely by modulating N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.",,"['Alawdi, Shawqi H', 'El-Denshary, Ezzeldin S', 'Safar, Marwa M', 'Eidi, Housam', 'David, Marie-Odile', 'Abdel-Wahhab, Mosaad A']","['Alawdi SH', 'El-Denshary ES', 'Safar MM', 'Eidi H', 'David MO', 'Abdel-Wahhab MA']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Thamar University, Dhamar, Yemen. shawqialawdi@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. shawqialawdi@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', ""Laboratory of Structure and Activity of Normal and Pathological Biomolecules (SABNP), INSERM U1204, Evry-Val d'Essonne University, 91025, Evry, France."", ""Laboratory of Structure and Activity of Normal and Pathological Biomolecules (SABNP), INSERM U1204, Evry-Val d'Essonne University, 91025, Evry, France."", 'Department of Food Toxicology and Contaminants, National Research Center, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt. mosaad_abdelwahhab@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160220,United States,Mol Neurobiol,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,"['0 (Aluminum Compounds)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nanodiamonds)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '3CYT62D3GA (Aluminum Chloride)']",IM,"['Aluminum Chloride', 'Aluminum Compounds/toxicity', 'Alzheimer Disease/chemically induced/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Chlorides/toxicity', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Male', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nanodiamonds/*administration & dosage', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aluminum', ""*Alzheimer's disease"", '*Bcl2', '*NF-kappaB', '*Nanodiamond', '*STAT3']",2016/02/22 06:00,2018/02/08 06:00,['2016/02/22 06:00'],"['2015/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12035-016-9762-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12035-016-9762-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Neurobiol. 2017 Apr;54(3):1906-1918. doi: 10.1007/s12035-016-9762-0.

Therefore, FLT3 is a potential therapeutic target for small molecule kinase inhibitors. In this study, protein-ligand interactions between FLT3 and kinase inhibitors (CEP701, PKC412, sunitinib, imatinib and dasatinib) were obtained through homology modelling and molecular docking. A cellular system for experimental testing of the inhibitors was also established by expressing wildtype and internal tandem duplication mutant FLT3 (FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD) in FDC-P1 cells. Imatinib and dasatinib could not be docked into any of the FLT3 models, consistent with their lack of activity in the experimental assays. CEP701, PKC412 and sunitinib interacted with the ATP-binding pocket of FLT3, forming H-bonds with Cys694 and Glu692. Based on the EC50 values in the cell proliferation assay, CEP701 was the most potent inhibitor; sunitinib and PKC412 were ranked second and third, respectively. Sunitinib was the most selective inhibitor, followed by PKC421 and CEP701. The potency of sunitinib and to a lesser extent CEP701 in inhibition of FLT3 autophosphorylation was lower than the cell proliferation inhibition, indicating that inhibition of FLT3 downstream proteins may contribute to the cellular effects. It was shown in this study that the docking procedure was able to differentiate FLT3 inhibitors from ineffective compounds. Additionally, interaction with the phosphate binding region in the ATP-binding pocket increased potency at the cost of selectivity. These findings can be applied in designing highly effective and selective inhibitors for FLT3 and other related kinases.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Amplification bias is a well-known limitation of PCR amplicon-based approaches. We sought to characterise lower-performance amplicons in an off-the-shelf NGS panel (TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel) for myeloid neoplasms and attempted to patch the low read depth for one of the affected genes, CEBPA. METHODS: We performed targeted NGS of 158 acute myeloid leukaemia samples and analysed the amplicon read depths across 568 amplicons to identify lower-performance amplicons. We also correlated the amplicon read depths with the template GC content. Finally, we attempted to patch the low read depth for CEBPA using a parallel library preparation (Nextera XT) workflow. RESULTS: We identified 16 lower-performance amplicons affecting nine genes, including CEBPA. There was a slight negative correlation between the amplicon read depths and template GC content. Addition of the separate CEBPA library generated a minimum read depth per base across the CEBPA gene ranging from 268x to 758x across eight samples. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of lower-performance amplicons will be informative to laboratories intending to use this panel. We have also demonstrated proof-of-concept that different libraries (TruSight Myeloid and Nextera XT) can be combined and sequenced on the same flow cell to generate additional reads for CEBPA.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

These problems occurred in the context of persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and leptomeningeal enhancement. Extensive diagnostic workups and therapeutic trials had failed to identify a clinically plausible cause or produce any significant improvement in the CSF and neuroimaging abnormalities. METHODS: We used high-throughput metagenomic shotgun sequencing to identify microbes in 2 CSF samples collected from the patient during his illness. These results were compared to sequence data from 1 CSF sample collected during treatment and 5 control CSF samples from other patients. RESULTS: We found sequences representing 53% and 67% of the Propionibacterium acnes genome in 2 CSF samples collected from the patient during his illness. Directed antimicrobial therapy was administered for 6 weeks with resolution of CSF and neuroimaging abnormalities. Sequencing of a sample obtained during treatment demonstrated that the P. acnes levels were decreased to background levels. After insertion of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, the patient returned to baseline status. CONCLUSIONS: High-throughput metagenomic shotgun sequencing revealed P. acnes as the cause of chronic meningitis that had eluded conventional attempts at diagnosis.

MATERIALS & METHODS: 3'-RACE and various standard PCR experiments were performed using cDNA of different human cell lines and liver tissue. The abundance of 3'-UTR fragments was analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Five different ABCB1 3'-UTR length variants were identified. miRNA binding sites were located only on the three longer fragments. Imatinib-resistant leukemia cells expressed predominantly shorter 3'-UTRs, where miRNA binding sites are absent.

Its expression is largely restricted to hematopoietic tissues and cell lines. Therefore, GADS is mainly involved in leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase signaling. GADS is known to interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated SHC, BCR-ABL and KIT. The SH2 domain of GADS has a similar binding specificity to that of GRB2 but its SH3 domain displays a different binding specificity, and thus it is involved in other downstream signaling pathways than GRB2. In the present study, we examined the role of GADS in FLT3 signaling. FLT3 is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase, which is mutated in more than 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the most common mutations is the internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. We observed that expression of GADS enhanced oncogenic FLT3-ITD-induced cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro. In a mouse xenograft model, GADS accelerated FLT3-ITD-dependent tumor formation. Furthermore, expression of GADS induced a transcriptional program leading to upregulation of MYC and mTORC1 target genes. GADS localizes to the cell membrane and strongly binds to ligand-stimulated wild-type FLT3 or is constitutively associated with the oncogenic mutant FLT3-ITD. We mapped the binding sites in FLT3 to pY955 and pY969 which overlaps with the GRB2 binding sites. Expression of GADS enhanced FLT3-mediated phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, p38 and STAT5. Taken together, our data suggests that GADS is an important downstream component of FLT3 signaling and expression of GADS potentiates FLT3-mediated mitogenic signaling.",,"['Chougule, Rohit A', 'Cordero, Eugenia', 'Moharram, Sausan A', 'Pietras, Kristian', 'Ronnstrand, Lars', 'Kazi, Julhash U']","['Chougule RA', 'Cordero E', 'Moharram SA', 'Pietras K', 'Ronnstrand L', 'Kazi JU']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University Cancer Center, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University Cancer Center, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University Cancer Center, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University Cancer Center, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University Cancer Center, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University Cancer Center, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Mona protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4924701,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3-ITD', 'GRAP2', 'RTK', 'STAT5']",2016/02/20 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2016/02/20 06:00'],"['2015/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['7415 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7415 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Mar 22;7(12):14112-24. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7415.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation of the NPM1 gene, causing delocalization of the protein, is the most frequent genetic lesion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); it is considered a founder event in AML pathogenesis and serves as a favorable prognostic marker. Moreover, in solid tumors and some leukemia cell lines, overexpression of the NPM1 gene is commonly observed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a new method for the detection of NPM1 mutations and the simultaneous analysis of copy number alterations (CNAs), which may underlie NPM1 gene expression deregulation. To address both of the issues, we applied a strategy based on multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). A designed NPM1mut+ assay enables the detection of three of the most frequent NPM1 mutations: A, B and D. The accuracy of the assay was tested using a group of 83 samples from Polish patients with AML and other blood-proliferative disorders. To verify the results, we employed traditional Sanger sequencing and next-generation transcriptome sequencing. With the use of the NPM1mut+ assay, we detected mutations A, D and B in 14, 1 and 0 of the analyzed samples, respectively. All of these mutations were confirmed by complementary sequencing approaches, proving the 100% specificity and sensitivity of the proposed test. The performed sequencing analysis allowed the identification of two additional rare mutations (I and ZE). All of the mutations were identified exclusively in AML cases, accounting for 25% of those cases. We did not observe any CNAs (amplifications) of the NPM1 gene in the studied samples, either with or without the mutation. The presented method is simple, reliable and cost-effective. It can be easily introduced into clinical practice or developed to target both less-frequent mutations in the NPM1 gene and other cancer-related genes.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The dominant clinical characteristics include erythrocytosis (with or without leukocytosis/thrombocytosis), thrombotic events, and symptoms. Increased risk of mortality is mainly caused by thrombotic events and progression to post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). The most important prognostic factors include age and a history of thrombotic events, although recent evidence has indicated that leukocytosis and additional cytogenetic aberrations may also be of significant prognostic value. First-line therapies include aspirin and phlebotomies, which significantly reduce the incidence of thrombotic events and prolong survival. Cytoreductive treatment with hydroxyurea (approved) and conventional or pegylated interferon-alpha (effective, but not approved in many countries) is initiated for high-risk or inadequately controlled disease, e.g., uncontrolled hematocrit, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, thrombotic events, splenomegaly, or symptoms. However, some patients may not receive initial benefit from first-line therapy or may become resistant or intolerant in due course. Although second-line treatment options are limited, clinical trials have shown the efficacy of ruxolitinib toward improving blood counts, enlarged spleen, and symptoms and potentially reducing thrombotic events. Identification of patients with uncontrolled PV is important for clinical care, as such patients have a high risk of complications, and future studies with JAK inhibitors or other agents alone or in combination are needed to test their potential to reduce rates of thrombotic events and transformation to PPV-MF or sAML.",,"['Reiter, Andreas', 'Harrison, Claire']","['Reiter A', 'Harrison C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer 1-3, 68167, Mannheim, Germany. andreas.reiter@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.', ""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitriles', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hydroxyurea', '*Interferon', '*Polycythemia vera', '*Ruxolitinib']",2016/02/20 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/02/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11899-016-0311-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-016-0311-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2016 Oct;11(5):356-67. doi: 10.1007/s11899-016-0311-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Semen quality in patients having testicular cancer (TGCT, n = 2315), Hodgkin's disease (HD, n = 1175), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 439), leukemia (L, n = 360), sarcoma (S, n = 208), brain tumour (BT, n = 40), Behcet's disease (Behcet's, n = 68) or multiple sclerosis (MS, n = 73) was studied and compared to that of 1448 fertile men candidates for sperm donation (CSD) and 208 partners of pregnant women (PPW). All samples were studied following the same methodology in a single laboratory. Post freezing and thawing semen characteristics were also studied. RESULTS: The percentage of normozoospermic men was only 37 % for L patients and lower than 60 % for TGCT, NHL, S and BT. The level of sperm production was differently decreased according to pathologies, the median total sperm count in TC and L patients being four times lower (p < 0.01 when compared to CSD and PPW). The lowest percentage of progressively motile spermatozoa was found for L and BT patients (both, p < 0.01 compared to CSD and PPW). The percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa was also reduced in cancer patients, especially in BT patients. Progressive motility after thawing in patients was about half that observed among candidates for sperm donation. In almost half of the semen of patients with testicular cancer or leukemia, the total number of motile spermatozoa per straw was less than 0.5 x 10(6) compared to 4.3 x 10(6) in CSD. CONCLUSIONS: The present data confirm on large series the deleterious impact of various cancers of the young adult on semen quality, establishing thus baseline data for future studies. Owing to the post-thaw quality of the frozen straws, future fertility projects for the majority of the patients studied (in case there is no post-treatment recovery of spermatogenesis) should necessitate an ICSI to provide the best chance of paternity whatever the fertility check-up in the female partner.",,"['Auger, Jacques', 'Sermondade, Nathalie', 'Eustache, Florence']","['Auger J', 'Sermondade N', 'Eustache F']","['Service d\'Histologie-Embryologie, Biologie de la Reproduction/CECOS, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Site Port-Royal, 53, Avenue de l\'Observatoire, 75014 Paris, France ; INSERM U1016, Equipe ""Genomique, Epigenetique et Physiologie de la Reproduction"", Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Histologie-Embryologie, Cytogenetique, Biologie de la Reproduction/CECOS, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis, Site Jean Verdier, 93143 Bondy, France."", 'Service d\'Histologie-Embryologie, Cytogenetique, Biologie de la Reproduction/CECOS, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis, Site Jean Verdier, 93143 Bondy, France ; INSERM U1016, Equipe ""Genomique, Epigenetique et Physiologie de la Reproduction"", Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160218,England,Basic Clin Androl,Basic and clinical andrology,101640161,,,,PMC4758099,['NOTNLM'],"['Assisted reproductive technologies', 'Cancer', 'Semen quality', 'Sperm banking', 'Sperm cryopreservation', 'Systemic disease']",2016/02/20 06:00,2016/02/20 06:01,['2016/02/20 06:00'],"['2015/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12610-016-0031-x [doi]', '31 [pii]']",epublish,Basic Clin Androl. 2016 Feb 18;26:3. doi: 10.1186/s12610-016-0031-x. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methylation status of the WT1 promoter was analyzed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The expression level of WT1 was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effect of DAC and ATRA on cell differentiation was evaluated by flow cytometry. The WT1 gene was methylated in U937 cells, but unmethylated in SHI-1 and K562 cells; the U937 cells did not express the WT1 gene, but the SHI-1 and K562 cells highly expressed the WT1 gene. DAC and ATRA, alone or in combination, exhibited no effect on the expression level of WT1 in the U937 cells and on the differentiation of the K562 cells. The combined treatment of DAC and ATRA markedly decreased the WT1 expression levels of the SHI-1 and K562 cells, and induced the differentiation of the SHI-1 and U937 cells. In the SHI-1 cells, WT1 expression changed inversely to the dynamic changes of cluster of differentiation 11b-positive rates.

Rats were treated with curcumin for 23 days and etoposide was administered for the final 3 days of the experiment. Curcumin synergistically potentiated the cytotoxic effect of etoposide, and it intensified apoptosis and phosphorylation of the histone H2AX induced by this cytostatic drug in leukemic HL-60 cells.

Curcumin modified the cytotoxic action of etoposide in HL-60 cells through intensification of free radical production because preincubation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) significantly reduced the cytotoxic effect of curcumin itself and a combination of two compounds. In contrast, NAC did not decrease the cytotoxic effect of etoposide. Thus, oxidative stress plays a greater role in the cytotoxic effect of curcumin than that of etoposide in HL-60 cells. In vitro results were confirmed in a BNML model. Pretreatment with curcumin enhanced the antileukemic activity of etoposide in BNML rats (1.57-fold tumor reduction versus etoposide alone; P<0.05) and induced apoptosis of BNML cells more efficiently than etoposide alone (1.54-fold change versus etoposide alone; P<0.05), but this treatment protected nonleukemic B-cells from apoptosis. Thus, curcumin can increase the antileukemic effect of etoposide through reactive oxygen species in sensitive myeloid leukemia cells, and it is harmless to normal human cells.",,"['Papiez, Monika A', 'Krzysciak, Wirginia', 'Szade, Krzysztof', 'Bukowska-Strakova, Karolina', 'Kozakowska, Magdalena', 'Hajduk, Karolina', 'Bystrowska, Beata', 'Dulak, Jozef', 'Jozkowicz, Alicja']","['Papiez MA', 'Krzysciak W', 'Szade K', 'Bukowska-Strakova K', 'Kozakowska M', 'Hajduk K', 'Bystrowska B', 'Dulak J', 'Jozkowicz A']","['Department of Cytobiology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Diagnostic, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland; Department of Clinical Immunology, Institute of Pediatrics, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland; Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160204,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Survivin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/analysis', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Survivin']",PMC4745860,['NOTNLM'],"['ROS', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'curcumin', 'etoposide', 'gamma-H2AX']",2016/02/20 06:00,2016/10/16 06:00,['2016/02/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S92687 [doi]', 'dddt-10-557 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2016 Feb 4;10:557-70. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S92687. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although increasing protein intake, in combination with resistance training, improves lean muscle mass in other populations, it is not known whether muscular tissue among survivors of ALL, whose impairments are treatment-related, will respond similarly. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations among dietary protein intake, resistance training, and lean muscle mass in survivors of ALL and age-, sex-, and race-matched controls. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Lean muscle mass was determined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, dietary information with 24-hour recalls, and participation in resistance training with a questionnaire. Participants were 365 survivors of ALL (52% male; 87% white; median age=28.5 years, range=23.6-31.7) and 365 controls with no previous cancer. RESULTS: Compared with controls, survivors of ALL had lower lean muscle mass (55.0 versus 57.2 kg, respectively) and lower percentage of lean muscle mass (68.6% versus 71.4%, respectively) than controls. Similar proportions of survivors (71.1%) and controls (69.7%) met recommended dietary protein intake (0.8 g/kg/d). Survivors (45.4%) were less likely to report resistance training than controls (53.8%). In adjusted models, 1-g higher protein intake per kilogram of body mass per day was associated with a 7.9% increase and resistance training >/=1xwk, with a 2.8% increase in lean muscle mass. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional study design limits temporal evaluation of the association between protein intake and lean muscle mass. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that survivors of childhood ALL with low lean muscle mass may benefit from optimizing dietary protein intake in combination with resistance training. Research is needed to determine whether resistance training with protein supplementation improves lean muscle mass in survivors of childhood ALL.",['(c) 2016 American Physical Therapy Association.'],"['Boland, Alexandra M', 'Gibson, Todd M', 'Lu, Lu', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'DeLany, James P', 'Partin, Robyn E', 'Lanctot, Jennifer Q', 'Howell, Carrie R', 'Nelson, Heather H', 'Chemaitilly, Wassim', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Mulrooney, Daniel A', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Ness, Kirsten K']","['Boland AM', 'Gibson TM', 'Lu L', 'Kaste SC', 'DeLany JP', 'Partin RE', 'Lanctot JQ', 'Howell CR', 'Nelson HH', 'Chemaitilly W', 'Pui CH', 'Robison LL', 'Mulrooney DA', 'Hudson MM', 'Ness KK']","['A.M.

BRAFV600E expression and activated forms of AKT, mTOR, ERK1/2, p70S6k and 4E-BP1 were immunohistochemically assessed in 77 BM biopsies of HCL patients and correlated with clinicopathological and BM microvascular characteristics, as well as with c-Caspase-3 levels in hairy cells. Additionally, we tested rapamycin treatment response of BONNA-12 wild-type cells or transfected with BRAFV600E. Most HCL cases expressed p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP1 but not p-mTOR, being accompanied by p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT. AKT/mTOR activation was evident in BONNA-12 cells irrespective of the presence of BRAFV600E mutation and was implicated in cell proliferation enhancement. In multivariate analysis p-AKT/p-mTOR/p-4E-BP1 overexpression was an adverse prognostic factor for time to next treatment conferring earlier relapse. When p-AKT, p-mTOR and p-4E-BP1 were examined separately only p-4E-BP1 remained significant. Our findings indicate that in HCL, critical proteins up- and downstream of mTOR are activated. Moreover, the strong associations with Raf-MEK-ERK signalling imply a possible biologic interaction between these pathways. Most importantly, expression of p-4E-BP1 alone or combined with p-AKT and p-mTOR is of prognostic value in patients with HCL.",,"['Lakiotaki, Eleftheria', 'Levidou, Georgia', 'Angelopoulou, Maria K', 'Adamopoulos, Christos', 'Pangalis, Gerassimos', 'Rassidakis, George', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros', 'Gainaru, Gabriella', 'Flevari, Pagona', 'Sachanas, Sotirios', 'Saetta, Angelica A', 'Sepsa, Athanasia', 'Moschogiannis, Maria', 'Kalpadakis, Christina', 'Tsesmetzis, Nikolaos', 'Milionis, Vassilios', 'Chatziandreou, Ilenia', 'Thymara, Irene', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis', 'Dimopoulou, Maria', 'Plata, Eleni', 'Konstantopoulos, Konstantinos', 'Patsouris, Efstratios', 'Piperi, Christina', 'Korkolopoulou, Penelope']","['Lakiotaki E', 'Levidou G', 'Angelopoulou MK', 'Adamopoulos C', 'Pangalis G', 'Rassidakis G', 'Vassilakopoulos T', 'Gainaru G', 'Flevari P', 'Sachanas S', 'Saetta AA', 'Sepsa A', 'Moschogiannis M', 'Kalpadakis C', 'Tsesmetzis N', 'Milionis V', 'Chatziandreou I', 'Thymara I', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Dimopoulou M', 'Plata E', 'Konstantopoulos K', 'Patsouris E', 'Piperi C', 'Korkolopoulou P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology, Athens Medical Centre, Psychikon Branch, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancer Centrum Karolinska, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology, Athens Medical Centre, Psychikon Branch, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology, Athens Medical Centre, Psychikon Branch, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancer Centrum Karolinska, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', '1st Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160219,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC4759548,,,2016/02/20 06:00,2016/12/20 06:00,['2016/02/20 06:00'],"['2015/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['srep21252 [pii]', '10.1038/srep21252 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Feb 19;6:21252. doi: 10.1038/srep21252.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biogenesis of ribosomes is a highly complex and energy consuming process that initiates in the nucleolus. Recently, a series of studies applying whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing techniques have led to the discovery of ribosomal protein gene mutations in different cancer types. Mutations in ribosomal protein genes have for example been found in endometrial cancer (RPL22), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RPL10, RPL5 and RPL11), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RPS15), colorectal cancer (RPS20), and glioma (RPL5). Moreover, patients suffering from Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a bone marrow failure syndrome caused by mutant ribosomal proteins are also at higher risk for developing leukemia, or solid tumors. Different experimental models indicate potential mechanisms whereby ribosomal proteins may initiate cancer development.

Although improvements in contemporary therapy and development of new treatment strategies have led to dramatic increases in the cure rate in children with ALL, the relapse rate remains high and the prognosis of relapsed childhood ALL is poor. Molecularly targeted therapies have emerged as the leading treatments in cancer therapy. Multi-cytotoxic drug regimens have achieved success, yet many studies addressing targeted therapies have focused on only one single agent. In this study, we attempted to investigate whether the effect of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin is synergistic with the effect of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) down-regulation in the treatment of ALL. METHODS: The effect of rapamycin combined with FAK down-regulation on cell proliferation, the cell cycle, and apoptosis was investigated in the human precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells REH and on survival time and leukemia progression in a non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mouse model. RESULTS: When combined with FAK down-regulation, rapamycin-induced suppression of cell proliferation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis were significantly enhanced. In addition, REH cell-injected NOD/SCID mice treated with rapamycin and a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to down-regulate FAK had significantly longer survival times and slower leukemia progression compared with mice injected with REH-empty vector cells and treated with rapamycin. Moreover, the B-cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) gene family was shown to be involved in the enhancement, by combined treatment, of REH cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: FAK down-regulation enhanced the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effects of rapamycin on REH cell growth, indicating that the simultaneous targeting of mTOR- and FAK-related pathways might offer a novel and powerful strategy for treating ALL.",,"['Shi, Pei-Jie', 'Xu, Lu-Hong', 'Lin, Kang-Yu', 'Weng, Wen-jun', 'Fang, Jian-Pei']","['Shi PJ', 'Xu LH', 'Lin KY', 'Weng WJ', 'Fang JP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 107, West Yan Jiang Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China. scorpiospj@163.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 107, West Yan Jiang Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China. xulvhong@126.com.', 'Department of Life Science, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 135, West Xin Gang Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510275, China. xiaoyu85321@126.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 107, West Yan Jiang Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China. wengwenjunlin@126.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 107, West Yan Jiang Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China. jpfang2005@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160218,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', '*RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4757994,,,2016/02/20 06:00,2016/10/25 06:00,['2016/02/20 06:00'],"['2015/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0241-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0241-x [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Feb 18;9:12. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0241-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, clinical trials have been started to evaluate ATRA plus arsenic trioxide (ATO) as a combination treatment for APL patients. However, little is known about the detailed mechanisms underlying its efficacy. We therefore investigated the effects of this combination on the differentiation and differentiation-related gene expression. MAIN METHODS: Human leukemia HL-60 cells differentiation was examined using nitro blue tetrazolium and CD11b. The levels of mRNA and protein were determined by RT-qPCR, microarray, western blot and ELISA, respectively. The promoter activity was assessed by luciferase activity. The arsenic concentration was determined by ICP-MS. KEY FINDINGS: ATRA-induced HL-60 differentiation was augmented by co-treatment with ATO. A microarray analysis showed that ATRA plus ATO treatment markedly down-regulated the expression of proteinase 3 (PRTN3), which is involved in the differentiation arrest of leukemia cells, compared with treatment with ATRA alone. The PRTN3 mRNA level was suppressed by treatment with ATRA alone, and then further suppressed by co-treatment with ATO, accompanied by a concomitant increase in Sp1 protein, which is known to facilitate differentiation. The expression levels of azurocidin, telomerase reverse transcriptase, ferritin, and interleukin-1beta were also altered by co-treatment with ATO. SIGNIFICANCE: Co-treatment with ATO enhances ATRA-induced HL-60 differentiation by altering the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation, providing the molecular basis for a combination therapy using ATO plus ATRA to treat leukemia patients.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

BIIB021 also resulted in proteasomal degradation of BCR-ABL proteins. In addition to induction of apoptosis, we report for the first time that BIIB021 induced autophagic response as evidenced by the formation of autophagosome, increased conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, decreased p62 (SQSTM1) protein levels. Further study suggested that Akt-mTOR-Ulk1 signaling pathway was involved in BIIB021-triggered autophagy. Moreover, blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitor 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1 significantly enhanced cell death and apoptosis induced by BIIB021, indicating the cytoprotective role of autophagy in BIIB021-treated CML cells. Collectively, these data provide possible molecular mechanisms for the antileukemic effect of BIIB021 on imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells and provide new insights into the future application of BIIB021 in the clinical treatment of CML.",,"['He, Wei', 'Ye, Xiujin', 'Huang, Xianbo', 'Lel, Wen', 'You, Liangshun', 'Wang, Lei', 'Chen, Xiaohui', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['He W', 'Ye X', 'Huang X', 'Lel W', 'You L', 'Wang L', 'Chen X', 'Qian W']","['Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.R.

These children typically present with decreased functional mobility, weakened lower extremity muscle strength and reduced exercise endurance and interests because of disease progressions and chemotherapy treatments. The purpose of this case report was to examine the effectiveness of incorporating a play-based physical therapy (PT) intervention programme to improve functional mobility for an inpatient with relapsed ALL undergoing chemotherapy. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 3-year-old male admitted to the hospital for relapsed ALL. He was diagnosed approximately 1 year earlier for which he had undergone chemotherapy and was later considered in remission at that time. When the patient relapsed, he underwent another round of chemotherapy and was waiting for a bone marrow transplant during his treatment during the course of this case report. For PT intervention, therapeutic exercises were incorporated into play to strengthen his lower extremity strength and muscle endurance. Functional activities were also incorporated into play to improve his aerobic capacity and overall quality of life. Multi-attribute health status classification system (HUI3) utility scores, 6-minute walk test distance (6MWT), lower extremity (LE) strength, transfer and tolerated treatment time were assessed to identify the effect of a PT intervention. OUTCOMES: Despite experiencing fatigue, the patient completed most of the treatments incorporated into play. After 5 weeks of PT intervention, the participant improved on HUI3 (pre: 0.72 and post: 0.92), 6MWT (pre: 156 ft and post: 489 ft), LE strength (squat), transfer (sit to stand) and tolerated treatment time (pre: 16 minutes and post: 44 minutes). DISCUSSION: This case report suggests that incorporating a play-based PT intervention programme could be physically tolerable and functionally beneficial for a young child with relapsed ALL undergoing inpatient chemotherapy.

Given the vital roles of the exocyst complex in cellular and developmental processes, the disruption of its function may be closely related to various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neuronal disorders. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) have high malignant potential and poor prognosis because of aggressive progression and metastasis. To date, no chemotherapeutic agents have been validated for MPNSTs treatment because how MPNSTs are resistant to chemotherapeutic agents remains unknown. This study demonstrates that combination of doxorubicin and sorafenib induces apoptosis in MPNST cells through downregulation of B cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-related protein long form of Bcl-x (Bcl-xl), and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). Moreover, both Sec6 and Sec8 levels decreased after treatment with doxorubicin and sorafenib and were found to be associated with Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expressions, but not Bcl-xl. Although Sec8 was found to be involved in the regulation of both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 at the mRNA level, Sec6 regulated Bcl-2 at the mRNA level and the binding affinity of F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 and Mcl-1, thereby controlling Mcl-1 at the protein level. Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 mRNA suppression by Sec6 or Sec8 depletion resulted in significant changes in nuclear factor-kappa B, cAMP response element, and p53 transcriptional activity. These results suggest that Sec6 and Sec8 are therapeutic target molecules in MPNST.",,"['Tanaka, Toshiaki', 'Kikuchi, Noriaki', 'Goto, Kaoru', 'Iino, Mitsuyoshi']","['Tanaka T', 'Kikuchi N', 'Goto K', 'Iino M']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Yamagata University, 2-2-2 Iidanishi, Yamagata, 990-9585, Japan. ttanaka@med.id.yamagata-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, School of Medicine, Yamagata University, 2-2-2 Iidanishi, Yamagata, Japan. ttanaka@med.id.yamagata-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, School of Medicine, Yamagata University, 2-2-2 Iidanishi, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Yamagata University, 2-2-2 Iidanishi, Yamagata, 990-9585, Japan.', 'Department of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, School of Medicine, Yamagata University, 2-2-2 Iidanishi, Yamagata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (EXOC3 protein, human)', '0 (EXOC4 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma protein 2', 'F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7', 'Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors', 'Myeloid cell leukemia 1', 'Sec6', 'Sec8']",2016/02/20 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10495-016-1230-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-016-1230-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2016 May;21(5):594-608. doi: 10.1007/s10495-016-1230-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide a summary of the reports of TKIs, used alone, and in combination with chemotherapy. TKIs are very effective alone and with corticosteroids and are likely to improve substantially the outcome when they are combined with standard or dose-adapted chemotherapy. While the complete haematologic remission rate is always very high, close to 100 %, the cytogenetic and molecular remission rates are lower, so that TKIs are still considered as a complement to chemotherapy and as a bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, many patients relapse before transplant, and many patients still relapse, even if they have been submitted to allo-SCT.

Because FLT3-N676K was encountered almost exclusively in inv(16) AML, we investigated the transforming potential of FLT3-N676K, the cooperation between FLT3-N676K and core binding factor ss-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (CBFss-SMMHC) (encoded by the inv(16) chimeric gene CBFB-MYH11) in inducing acute leukemia, and tested the sensitivity of FLT3-N676K-positive leukemic cells to FLT3 inhibitors. Retroviral expression of FLT3-N676K in myeloid 32D cells induced AML in syngeneic C3H/HeJ mice (n = 11/13, median latency 58 days), with a transforming activity similar to FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) (n = 8/8), FLT3-TKD D835Y (n = 8/9), and FLT3-ITD-N676K (n = 9/9) mutations. Three out of 14 (21.4 %) C57BL/6J mice transplanted with FLT3-N676K-transduced primary hematopoietic progenitor cells developed acute leukemia (latency of 68, 77, and 273 days), while no hematological malignancy was observed in the control groups including FLT3-ITD. Moreover, co-expression of FLT3-N676K/CBFss-SMMHC did not promote acute leukemia in three independent experiments (n = 16). In comparison with FLT3-ITD, FLT3-N676K induced much higher activation of FLT3 and tended to trigger stronger phosphorylation of MAPK and AKT. Importantly, leukemic cells carrying the FLT3-N676K mutant in the absence of an ITD mutation were highly sensitive to FLT3 inhibitors AC220 and crenolanib, and crenolanib even retained activity against the AC220-resistant FLT3-ITD-N676K mutant. Taken together, the FLT3-N676K mutant is potent to transform murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vivo. This is the first report of acute leukemia induced by an activating FLT3 mutation in C57BL/6J mice.

Currently, alternative medicines, using herb extracts, have been developed for cancer treatment. In this study, the effect of diallyl disulfide (DADS) on the induction of apoptosis and autophagy was investigated in K562 and NB4 myeloid leukemia cells. Leukemia cells were treated with various concentrations of DADS for 24 and 48 h. The percentage of cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. The percentages of apoptosis and autophagy were analyzed by staining with annexin-FITC and anti-LC3 FITC-conjugated antibodies, respectively. Then, the stained cells were detected by flow cytometry. In addition, PP242, a mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, was used to study the involvement of the mTOR pathway in DADS-induced apoptosis and autophagy. mTOR mRNA expression was measured by real-time PCR.

The highest percentages of apoptosis and autophagy were shown in cells treated with 100 mug/ml DADS combined with 10 muM of the mTOR inhibitor.

Western blotting was used to analyze the protein of caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by a fl ow cytometer after exposures. Compared with PpIX alone and ultrasound alone groups, the synergistic cytotoxicity of PpIX plus ultrasound were significantly boosted. In addition, as determined by Annexin V-PE/7-AAD staining, SDT significantly induced HL-60 cell apoptosis, the obvious nuclear condensation was also found with HO staining at 4 hours post-SDT treatment. Furthermore, Western blotting showed visible enhancement of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in this process. Besides, intracellular ROS production was significantly enhanced after SDT.

Hence, glutaminase free asparaginase is much needed for upgradation of therapeutic index of asparaginase therapy. In the present study, glutaminase free asparaginase produced from Enterobacter cloacae was purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme was found to be homodimer of approximately 106 kDa with monomeric size of approximately 52 kDa and pI 4.5. Purified enzyme showed optimum activity between pH 7-8 and temperature 35-40 degrees C, which is close to the internal environment of human body. Monovalent cations such as Na+ and K+ enhanced asparaginase activity whereas divalent and trivalent cations, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Fe3+ inhibited the enzyme activity. Kinetic parameters Km, Vmax and Kcat of purified enzyme were found to be 1.58x10-3 M, 2.22 IU mug-1 and 5.3 x 104 S-1, respectively.

The cytotoxic activity of enzyme was examined against a panel of human cancer cell lines, HL-60, MOLT-4, MDA-MB-231 and T47D, and highest cytotoxicity observed against HL-60 cells (IC50 ~ 3.1 IU ml-1), which was comparable to commercial asparaginase. Cell and nuclear morphological studies of HL-60 cells showed that on treatment with purified asparaginase symptoms of apoptosis were increased in dose dependent manner. Cell cycle progression analysis indicates that enzyme induces apoptosis by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Mitochondrial membrane potential loss showed that enzyme also triggers the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

Epigenetic silencing of AKAP12 has been demonstrated in different cancer entities and this has been linked to the process of tumorigenesis. Here, we used quantitative high-resolution DNA methylation measurement by MassARRAY to investigate epigenetic regulation of all three AKAP12 promoters (i.e., alpha, beta, and gamma) within a large cohort of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) patient samples. The AKAP12alpha promoter shows DNA hypermethylation in JMML samples, which is associated with decreased AKAP12alpha expression. Promoter methylation of AKAP12alpha correlates with older age at diagnosis, elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin and poor prognosis. In silico screening for transcription factor binding motifs around the sites of most pronounced methylation changes in the AKAP12alpha promoter revealed highly significant scores for GATA-2/-1 sequence motifs. Both transcription factors are known to be involved in the haematopoietic differentiation process. Methylation of a reporter construct containing this region resulted in strong suppression of AKAP12 promoter activity, suggesting that DNA methylation might be involved in the aberrant silencing of the AKAP12 promoter in JMML. Exposure to DNMT- and HDAC-inhibitors reactivates AKAP12alpha expression in vitro, which could potentially be a mechanism underlying clinical treatment responses upon demethylating therapy. Together, these data provide evidence for epigenetic silencing of AKAP12alpha in JMML and further emphasize the importance of dysregulated RAS signaling in JMML pathogenesis.",,"['Wilhelm, Thomas', 'Lipka, Daniel B', 'Witte, Tania', 'Wierzbinska, Justyna A', 'Fluhr, Silvia', 'Helf, Monika', 'Mucke, Oliver', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Konermann, Carolin', 'Nollke, Peter', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Flotho, Christian', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Wilhelm T', 'Lipka DB', 'Witte T', 'Wierzbinska JA', 'Fluhr S', 'Helf M', 'Mucke O', 'Claus R', 'Konermann C', 'Nollke P', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Flotho C', 'Plass C']","['a Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b Regulation of Cellular Differentiation Group, Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b Regulation of Cellular Differentiation Group, Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'c Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center , Freiburg , Germany.', 'd Hermann Staudinger Graduate School, University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany.', 'b Regulation of Cellular Differentiation Group, Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b Regulation of Cellular Differentiation Group, Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'e Department of Medicine , Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center , Freiburg , Germany.', 'a Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'c Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center , Freiburg , Germany.', 'c Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center , Freiburg , Germany.', 'f German Cancer Consortium (DKTK).', 'c Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center , Freiburg , Germany.', 'f German Cancer Consortium (DKTK).', 'a Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'f German Cancer Consortium (DKTK).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160218,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (A Kinase Anchor Proteins)', '0 (AKAP12 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)']",IM,"['A Kinase Anchor Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics', 'Male', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4846096,['NOTNLM'],"['AKAP12', 'Azacytidine', 'DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', 'Leukemia']",2016/02/19 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15592294.2016.1145327 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2016;11(2):110-9. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2016.1145327.

However, they can also cause rapid induction of apoptosis in a cell-cycle phase independent manner. BNC105 is a novel vascular and microtubule disrupting drug that also induces apoptosis rapidly but with markedly increased potency compared to vinca alkaloids and combretastatin A4. BNC105 binds to the colchicine-binding site on tubulin resulting in activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylation of ATF2, and induction of ATF3 and Noxa leading to acute apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Apoptosis induced by BNC105 is dependent upon both JNK activation and Noxa induction. Normal leukocytes and one CLL sample also exhibited JNK activation but not Noxa induction and were resistant to BNC105. This study emphasizes the importance of Noxa and JNK for induction of apoptosis in CLL cells by microtubule targeting drugs, and highlights the potential of BNC105 as a potent therapeutic to treat haematopoietic malignancies.",,"['Bates, Darcy', 'Feris, Edmond J', 'Danilov, Alexey V', 'Eastman, Alan']","['Bates D', 'Feris EJ', 'Danilov AV', 'Eastman A']","['a Department of Medicine , Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.', 'c Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.', 'b Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology , Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.', 'c Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine , Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.', 'c Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.', 'b Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology , Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.', 'c Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160130,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Anisoles)', '0 (BNC 105)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'I5590ES2QZ (fosbretabulin)']",IM,"['Anisoles/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzofurans/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Microtubules/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",PMC4847999,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BNC105', 'Noxa', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinase', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",2016/02/19 06:00,2017/01/14 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2016.1139245 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2016;17(3):291-9. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2016.1139245.

Clinical trials in adults have demonstrated safety, tolerability, and activity, leading to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for adults with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Pediatric experience with VSLI is limited. PROCEDURE: This single center, phase I dose escalation study examined the safety, toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and pharmacokinetics of VSLI administered weekly to pediatric patients age <21 years with relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory solid tumors or leukemia. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects were treated in total. Median age was 13.3 years (range 2-19). Fourteen subjects completed one 28-day cycle of therapy and five subjects completed more than one cycle. No subject experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the first dose level (1.75 mg/m(2) /dose, dose range: 2-3.7 mg). At the second dose level (2.25 mg/m(2) /dose, dose range: 1.3-4.5 mg), one subject had transient dose-limiting grade 4 transaminase elevation, and this dose level was expanded with no additional DLT observed. The second dose level then opened to an expansion phase to evaluate activity in ALL. Clinical activity included minimal residual disease negative complete remission in one subject with ALL and stable disease in nine subjects. Clearance of total vincristine was found to be approximately 100-fold lower in comparison to published data using standard vincristine. CONCLUSIONS: Children tolerate 2.25 mg/m(2) /dose of weekly VSLI (the adult FDA-approved dose) with evidence for clinical activity without dose-limiting neurotoxicity. Future plans include studying VSLI as substitution for standard vincristine with combination chemotherapy in children with ALL.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Shah, Nirali N', 'Merchant, Melinda S', 'Cole, Diane E', 'Jayaprakash, Nalini', 'Bernstein, Donna', 'Delbrook, Cindy', 'Richards, Kelly', 'Widemann, Brigitte C', 'Wayne, Alan S']","['Shah NN', 'Merchant MS', 'Cole DE', 'Jayaprakash N', 'Bernstein D', 'Delbrook C', 'Richards K', 'Widemann BC', 'Wayne AS']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland;', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20160217,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Registries', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC6689398,['NOTNLM'],"['Marqibo(R)', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'pediatric', 'phase I']",2016/02/19 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25937 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jun;63(6):997-1005. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25937.

Furthermore, CALR mutations in ET are structurally classified as type 1/type 1-like or type 2/type 2-like variants. The objective of the current study was to examine the impact of CALR mutation variant stratified driver mutational status on overall (OS), myelofibrosis-free (MFFS), thrombosis-free, and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in ET; 495 patients (median age 58 years; 61% females) with ET were fully annotated for the their driver mutational status: 321 (65%) harbored JAK2, 109 (22%) CALR, and 12 (2%) MPL mutations and 11% were triple-negative. Among the 109 CALR-mutated cases, 52% were classified as type 1/type 1-like and 48% as type 2/type 2-like. In univariate analysis, triple-negative patients displayed the best and MPL mutated the worst OS (P = 0.007); however, the difference in OS was no longer apparent on multivariable analysis that included age and sex as covariates (P = 0.5). LFS was also similar among the different mutational groups (P = 0.6) whereas MFFS was significantly shorter in MPL-mutated patients on both univariate and multivariable analyses (age-adjusted P = 0.02; HR 7.9, 95% CI 2.0-31.5). Also in multivariable analysis that included thrombosis history, age, and cardiovascular risk factors, the presence of JAK2 or MPL mutations was independently associated with higher risk of thrombosis (P = 0.02; HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.4). In conclusion, driver mutational status in ET does not appear to influence overall or LFS, even after CALR variant stratification. However, the presence of MPL mutations might be associated with a higher risk of fibrotic transformation and the presence of JAK2/MPL mutations with higher risk of thrombosis.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Elala, Yoseph C', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Finke, Christy', 'Barraco, Daniela', 'Haider, Mahnur', 'Abou Hussein, Ahmed K', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Elala YC', 'Lasho TL', 'Gangat N', 'Finke C', 'Barraco D', 'Haider M', 'Abou Hussein AK', 'Hanson CA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Pardanani A', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Cytogenetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160404,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*genetics/mortality', 'Young Adult']",,,,2016/02/19 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24338 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2016 May;91(5):503-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24338.

The characteristics of the obtained sensors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Both GSH-MIP and GSSG-MIP sensors exhibit the relatively wide linear detection range and low detection limit of 1.33 x 10(-10) M (S/N=3). It is found that N-acetylcysteine and DL-homocysteine, the precursors of GSH, show little influence on the detection of glutathione species, nor did the reactants of arsenite and GSH. Such strategies were successfully applied to discriminate GSH and GSSG in cell samples with acceptable recoveries of 92.0-109.1%, and the results are comparable with classic o-phthalaldehyde fluorospectrophotometry.

Neutrophil lifespan is short, is prolonged by pro-inflammatory stimuli, controls functionality of the cells and can determine tissue damage. Experimental analysis of primary neutrophils is difficult because of their short lifespan and lack of possibilities of genetic manipulation. The Hoxb8 system of neutrophil differentiation from immortalized progenitor cells offers the advantage of unlimited production of neutrophils in vitro as well as easy genetic modification. We here use this system to analyze the role of the poorly characterized anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2) family member A1/Bfl-1 (Bcl-2-related protein A1) for survival and homeostasis of neutrophils and of neutrophil progenitors. Low constitutive mRNA and protein expression of A1 was detected, while A1 was transiently upregulated early during differentiation. Pro-inflammatory stimuli caused strong, mainly transcriptional, A1 upregulation, in contrast to posttranscriptional regulation of Mcl-1 (induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein). Inhibitor studies showed that phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) is required for A1 expression and survival of progenitors and mature neutrophils. ShRNA-mediated constitutive A1 knockdown (KD) impaired maintenance of progenitors. ShRNA experiments further showed that A1 was required early during neutrophil differentiation as well as in mature neutrophils upon pro-inflammatory stimulation.

In addition, a variety of gene mutations with unclear prognostic value have been identified: SF3B1, ATM, and BIRC3 may describe CLL with adverse outcome, whereas NOTCH1 is predictive for resistance against CD20 antibodies.

At low micromolar concentrations the selected derivative of (R)-3-aminopyrrolidine 3c and its stereoisomer (S)-3-aminopyrrolidine 3d caused an apoptotic cell death preceded by an arrest in the G2/M phase. Studies of intracellular targets showed that 3c and 3d formed stable intercalative complexes with the duplex DNA as determined by spectral analysis and molecular docking. Both 3c and 3d attenuated topoisomerase 1 and 2 mediated unwinding of the supercoiled DNA via a mechanism different from conventional DNA-enzyme tertiary complex formation. Furthermore, 3d decreased the activity of selected human protein kinases in vitro, indicating multiple targeting by the new chemotype. Finally, 3d demonstrated an antitumor activity in a model of murine intraperitoneally transplanted P388 leukemia, achieving the increase of animal life span up to 262% at tolerable doses.

However, it has been unclear whether referral to the CLL clinic influences patient outcome. Overall survival (OS) was assessed for all CLL/SLL patients diagnosed in Manitoba between 2007 and 2011. Of 555 patients, 281 (51%) were referred to the CLL clinic. Patients seen in this clinic had a twofold increased OS compared to patients who were managed by other hematologists and general practitioners (HR 2.375, P 0.0002) when adjusted for age, gender, presence of pre- or post-CLL cancer, treatment and urban/rural location. In the nonreferred population there was a striking correlation between advancing age and decreasing OS. However, this correlation was almost eliminated in the referred population who were more likely to receive chemotherapy. Patients referred and seen in the CLL clinic have an improved OS compared to nonreferred patients and this appears to be primarily related to improved OS in the elderly.

In particular, a disturbed DNA damage response (DDR) and an activated B-cell receptor signaling pathway play a major role in promoting CLL cell survival. External stimuli are similarly essential for CLL cell survival and lead to activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) influences the disturbed anti-apoptotic balance of CLL cells. Losses or disabling mutations in TP53 and ATM are frequent events in chemotherapy-naive patients and are further enriched in chemotherapy-resistant patients. As these lesions define key regulatory elements of the DDR pathway, they also determine treatment response to genotoxic therapy. Novel therapeutic strategies therefore try to circumvent defective DDR signaling and to suppress the pro-survival stimuli received from the tumor microenvironment. With increasing knowledge on specific genetic alterations of CLL, we may be able to target CLL cells more efficiently even in the situation of mutated DDR pathways or protection by microenvironmental stimuli.","['(c) 2016 S.

METHODS: Specimens of 9 patients evaluated on a service basis in the Mayo Clinic Neuroimmunology Laboratory by tissue-based immunofluorescence assay (IFA) yielded a robust, synaptic immunostaining pattern consistent with mGluR1-IgG (serum, 9; CSF, 2 available). Transfected HEK293 cell-based assay (CBA) confirmed mGluR1 specificity in all 11 specimens. A further 2 patients were detected in Germany primarily by CBA. RESULTS: The median symptom onset age for the 11 patients was 58 years (range 33-81 years); 6 were male. All 9 Mayo Clinic patients had subacute onset of cerebellar ataxia, 4 had dysgeusia, 1 had psychiatric symptoms, and 1 had cognitive impairment. All were evaluated for malignancy, but only 1 was affected (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). One developed ataxia post-herpes zoster infection. Head MRIs were generally atrophic or normal-appearing, and CSF was inflammatory in just 1 of 5 tested, though mGluR1-IgG was detected in both specimens submitted. Five patients improved (attributable to immunotherapy in 4, spontaneously in 1), 3 stabilized (attributable to immunotherapy in 2, cancer therapy in 1), and 1 progressively declined (untreated). The 2 German patients had ataxia, but fulfilled multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria (1 relapsing-remitting, 1 progressive). However, both had histories of hematologic malignancy (acute lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma), and had mGluR1-IgG detected in serum by CBA (weakly positive on tissue-based IFA). CONCLUSIONS: mGluR1 autoimmunity represents a treatable form of cerebellar ataxia. Dysgeusia may be a diagnostic clue.

Some have reported apparent associations with adiposity in childhood or early adulthood, but whether these associations are independent of recent adiposity is unknown. Birth weight, body size at age 10 years, clothes size at age 20 years, and recent body mass index (BMI) were recorded in 745,273 UK women, mean age 60.1 (SD 4.9) at baseline, without prior cancer. They were followed for 11 years, during which time 5,765 lymphoid malignancies occurred. Using Cox regression, a higher risk of lymphoid malignancy was strongly associated with higher recent BMI (RR=1.33, 95%CI 1.17-1.51, for BMI 35+ vs <22.5 kg/m(2)), and this association remained essentially unchanged after adjustment for birth weight and body size at 10. Higher lymphoid malignancy risk was also associated with large size at birth, at age 10, and at age 20 years, but after adjustment for recent BMI, the significance of the associations with large size at birth and at age 10 years was sufficiently reduced that residual confounding by adult BMI could not be excluded; a weak association with large size at 20 years remained (adjusted RR =1.17, 95%CI 1.10-1.24 for large size at age 20 vs. medium or small size). We found no strong evidence of histological specificity in any of these associations. In conclusion, our findings suggest a possible role of adiposity throughout adulthood in the risk of lymphoid malignancy, but the independent contribution of body size at birth and during childhood appears to be small.","['(c) 2016 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley &', 'Sons Ltd on behalf of UICC.']","['Yang, TienYu Owen', 'Cairns, Benjamin J', 'Kroll, Mary E', 'Reeves, Gillian K', 'Green, Jane', 'Beral, Valerie']","['Yang TO', 'Cairns BJ', 'Kroll ME', 'Reeves GK', 'Green J', 'Beral V']","['Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, United Kingdom.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, United Kingdom.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, United Kingdom.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, United Kingdom.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, United Kingdom.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adiposity/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Birth Weight', '*Body Mass Index', '*Body Size', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC4855635,['NOTNLM'],"['body mass index', 'childhood obesity', 'lymphoid malignancies', 'lymphoma', 'myeloma', 'obesity']",2016/02/19 06:00,2016/08/27 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.30044 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Jul 1;139(1):42-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30044.,,"['G0700474/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G9900923/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K02700X/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,['Million Women Study Collaborators'],,,,,,,"['Abbiss H', 'Abbott S', 'Alison R', 'Allen N', 'Armstrong M', 'Baker K', 'Balkwill A', 'Banks E', 'Barnes I', 'Beral V', 'Black J', 'Blanks R', 'Bradbury K', 'Brown A', 'Cairns B', 'Canfell K', 'Canoy D', 'Chadwick A', 'Crowe F', 'Ewart D', 'Ewart S', 'Fletcher L', 'Floud S', 'Gathani T', 'Gerrard L', 'Goodill A', 'Green J', 'Guiver L', 'Hozak M', 'Lingard I', 'Kan SW', 'Langston N', 'Liu B', 'Moser K', 'Pirie K', 'Reeves G', 'Shaw K', 'Sherman E', 'Strange H', 'Sweetland S', 'Tipper S', 'Travis R', 'Trickett L', 'Wright L', 'Yang O', 'Young H']","['Abbiss, Hayley', 'Abbott, Simon', 'Alison, Rupert', 'Allen, Naomi', 'Armstrong, Miranda', 'Baker, Krys', 'Balkwill, Angela', 'Banks, Emily', 'Barnes, Isobel', 'Beral, Valerie', 'Black, Judith', 'Blanks, Roger', 'Bradbury, Kathryn', 'Brown, Anna', 'Cairns, Benjamin', 'Canfell, Karen', 'Canoy, Dexter', 'Chadwick, Andrew', 'Crowe, Francesca', 'Ewart, Dave', 'Ewart, Sarah', 'Fletcher, Lee', 'Floud, Sarah', 'Gathani, Toral', 'Gerrard, Laura', 'Goodill, Adrian', 'Green, Jane', 'Guiver, Lynden', 'Hozak, Michal', 'Lingard, Isobel', 'Kan, Sau Wan', 'Langston, Nicky', 'Liu, Bette', 'Moser, Kath', 'Pirie, Kirstin', 'Reeves, Gillian', 'Shaw, Keith', 'Sherman, Emma', 'Strange, Helena', 'Sweetland, Sian', 'Tipper, Sarah', 'Travis, Ruth', 'Trickett, Lyndsey', 'Wright, Lucy', 'Yang, Owen', 'Young, Heather']",,

In this study, we further evaluated the effect of TN on human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells using time-lapse microscopy. Our assay revealed a previously unappreciated early event induced by TN-exposure, in which, at 30-60 min after TN addition, the cells extruded their nuclei into the extracellular space, followed by discharge of DNA fibers to form NET-like structures. Intriguingly, neither nuclear extrusion nor DNA discharge was observed when cells were exposed to inducers of UPR, such as brefeldin A, thapsigargin, or dithiothreitol. Our findings revealed novel nuclear dynamics during TN-induced NETosis-like cellular suicide in HL-60 cells and suggested that the toxicological effect of TN on nuclear extrusion and DNA discharge was not a simple UPR.",['(c) 2016 International Federation for Cell Biology.'],"['Nakayama, Tomofumi', 'Saitoh, Noriko', 'Morotomi-Yano, Keiko', 'Yano, Ken-Ichi', 'Nakao, Mitsuyoshi', 'Saitoh, Hisato']","['Nakayama T', 'Saitoh N', 'Morotomi-Yano K', 'Yano K', 'Nakao M', 'Saitoh H']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, 2-39-1 Kurokami, Kumamoto, 860-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto , University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Institute of Pulsed Power Science, Kumamoto , University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Institute of Pulsed Power Science, Kumamoto , University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto , University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, 2-39-1 Kurokami, Kumamoto, 860-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160304,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Extracellular Traps/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cell death', 'extracellular chromatin', 'nucleus', 'tunicamycin']",2016/02/19 06:00,2017/01/26 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbin.10594 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2016 May;40(5):597-602. doi: 10.1002/cbin.10594.

Empirical therapies with broad-spectrum intravenous bactericidal, anti-pseudomonal antibiotics are accepted treatments for febrile neutropenic patients. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP-TAZO) and cefoperozone-sulbactam (CS) therapies in adult patients with haematological malignancies presenting with neutropenic fever in a prospective study design. METHODS: Patients with haematological malignancies (leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome) were recruited from June 2010-May 2013. Participants were over 18 years old, with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500/mm(3) following chemotherapy or expected to have an ANC less than 500/mm(3) in the first 48 h post-chemotherapy, and with an oral body temperature >/= 38.3 degrees C at a single measurement or 38.0 degrees C after 1-h monitoring. Patients were randomised to the two treatment groups. The initial empirical therapy comprised PIP-TAZO (4.5 g/6 h/day, IV) and CS (2 g/8 h/day, IV). RESULTS: The overall success rate was 61% with CS and 49% with PIP-TAZO (p =0.247). Factors affecting the treatment success included a neutrophil count <100/mm3, being in the relapse/refractory stage of malignancy, and the presence of a microbiologically documented infection (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PIP-TAZO and CS monotherapies are equally effective and safe for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic patients.",,"['Aynioglu, Aynur', 'Mutlu, Birsen', 'Hacihanefioglu, Abdullah']","['Aynioglu A', 'Mutlu B', 'Hacihanefioglu A']","['Aynur Aynioglu, Department infectious diseases and clinical microbiology, Zonguldak Ataturk Public Hos-pital, Zonguldak, Turkey. aaynioglu@outlook.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20160203,Spain,Rev Esp Quimioter,Revista espanola de quimioterapia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Quimioterapia,9108821,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '157044-21-8 (Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination)', '7U75I1278D (Cefoperazone)', '87-53-6 (Penicillanic Acid)', 'S4TF6I2330 (Sulbactam)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cefoperazone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Eruptions/epidemiology', 'Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Penicillanic Acid/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Piperacillin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sulbactam/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,2016/02/19 06:00,2017/01/04 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['aynur16feb2016 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Esp Quimioter. 2016 Apr;29(2):69-75.

After a 7-day prednisone prephase, 3720 patients enrolled on trial Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica and Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (AIEOP-BFM) ALL 2000 were randomly selected to receive either dexamethasone (10 mg/m(2) per day) or prednisone (60 mg/m(2) per day) for 3 weeks plus tapering in induction. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (+/- standard error) was 10.8 +/- 0.7% in the dexamethasone and 15.6 +/- 0.8% in the prednisone group (P < .0001), showing the largest effect on extramedullary relapses. The benefit of dexamethasone was partially counterbalanced by a significantly higher induction-related death rate (2.5% vs 0.9%, P = .00013), resulting in 5-year event-free survival rates of 83.9 +/- 0.9% for dexamethasone and 80.8 +/- 0.9% for prednisone (P = .024). No difference was seen in 5-year overall survival (OS) in the total cohort (dexamethasone, 90.3 +/- 0.7%; prednisone, 90.5 +/- 0.7%). Retrospective analyses of predefined subgroups revealed a significant survival benefit from dexamethasone only for patients with T-cell ALL and good response to the prednisone prephase (prednisone good-response [PGR]) (dexamethasone, 91.4 +/- 2.4%; prednisone, 82.6 +/- 3.2%; P = .036). In patients with precursor B-cell ALL and PGR, survival after relapse was found to be significantly worse if patients were previously assigned to the dexamethasone arm. We conclude that, for patients with PGR in the large subgroup of precursor B-cell ALL, dexamethasone especially reduced the incidence of better salvageable relapses, resulting in inferior survival after relapse. This explains the lack of benefit from dexamethasone in overall survival that we observed in the total cohort except in the subset of T-cell ALL patients with PGR.

A total of 90 patients with a follow-up of >/=12 months were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 26.6 months after imatinib discontinuation, 37 patients lost the major molecular response. The probability of sustained major molecular response at 12 months and 24 months was 62.2% and 58.5%, respectively. All 37 patients who lost major molecular response were retreated with imatinib therapy for a median of 16.9 months, and all achieved major molecular response again at a median of 3.9 months after resuming imatinib therapy. We observed newly developed or worsened musculoskeletal pain and pruritus in 27 (30%) patients after imatinib discontinuation. Imatinib withdrawal syndrome was associated with a higher probability of sustained major molecular response (P=0.003) and showed a trend for a longer time to major molecular response loss (P=0.098). Positivity (defined as >/= 17 positive chambers) of digital polymerase chain reaction at screening and longer imatinib duration before imatinib discontinuation were associated with a higher probability of sustained major molecular response.

Current cure rates, even with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, are no better than 50%-60%. Pre-clinical research on juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia is urgently needed for the identification of novel therapies but is hampered by the unavailability of culture systems. Here we report a xenotransplantation model that allows long-term in vivo propagation of primary juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia cells. Persistent engraftment of leukemic cells was achieved by intrahepatic injection of 1x10(6) cells into newborn Rag2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice or intravenous injection of 5x10(6) cells into 5-week old mice. Key characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia were reproduced, including cachexia and clonal expansion of myelomonocytic progenitor cells that infiltrated bone marrow, spleen, liver and, notably, lung. Xenografted leukemia cells led to reduced survival of recipient mice. The stem cell character of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia was confirmed by successful serial transplantation that resulted in leukemia cell propagation for more than one year. Independence of exogenous cytokines, low donor cell number and slowly progressing leukemia are advantages of the model, which will serve as an important tool to research the pathophysiology of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and test novel pharmaceutical strategies such as DNA methyltransferase inhibition.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Krombholz, Christopher Felix', 'Aumann, Konrad', 'Kollek, Matthias', 'Bertele, Daniela', 'Fluhr, Silvia', 'Kunze, Mirjam', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Flotho, Christian', 'Erlacher, Miriam']","['Krombholz CF', 'Aumann K', 'Kollek M', 'Bertele D', 'Fluhr S', 'Kunze M', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Flotho C', 'Erlacher M']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany Hermann Staudinger Graduate School, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany The German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany The German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany The German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany miriam.erlacher@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160217,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biopsy', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/*deficiency', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', '*Neoplasm Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",PMC5004370,,,2016/02/19 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.138545 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.138545 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 May;101(5):597-606. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.138545.

METHODS: MTT assay was used to assess the proliferation-inhibiting effect of FW-04-806. Cell cycle was analyzed with propidium iodide by flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis was determined using the FITC mV apoptosis detection kit. Western blot was applied to reveal the protein expression of related proliferative and apoptotic signaling pathways. The changes of mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by flow cytometry. Protein-protein interactions was shown by co-immunoprecipitation. The level of mRNA was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: FW-04-806 obviously inhibited cell proliferation in the HL60, K562 and HL60/Bcr-Abl cell lines, with an IC50 of (30.89 +/- 0.12) micromol/L, (9.76 +/- 0.19) micromol/L and (8.03 +/- 0.26) micromol/L, respectively (P<0.001). Compared with the vehicle group, the two increasing doses of FW-04-806 showed inhibition of tumor growth at a rate of (17.40 +/- 0.34)% and (34.33 +/- 5.00)%, respectively, in the K562 cell line groups (P=0.003), and (18.90 +/- 1.45)% and (35.60 +/- 3.55)% (P=0.001) in the HL60/Bcr-Abl cell line groups. FW-04-806 dissociated Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperon/co-chaperon complex, followed by degradation of the Hsp90 proteins through proteasome pathway without affecting mRNA expression.

Even though many positive results have been found in the laboratory, wider clinical use of ATO has been compromised by its toxicity at higher concentrations. The aim of this study was to explore an improved method for delivering ATO using liposomal nanotechnology to evaluate whether this could reduce drug toxicity and improve the efficacy of ATO in treating human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers. HeLa, C33a, and human keratinocytes were exposed to 5 mum of ATO in both free and liposomal forms for 48 h. The stability of the prepared samples was tested using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) to measure the intracellular arsenic concentrations after treatment. Fluorescent double-immunocytochemical staining was carried out to evaluate the protein expression levels of HPV-E6 oncogene and caspase-3. Cell apoptosis was analysed by flow cytometry. Results showed that liposomal ATO was more effective than free ATO in reducing protein levels of HPV-E6 and inducing cell apoptosis in HeLa cells. Moreover, lower toxicity was observed when liposomal-delivered ATO was used. This could be explained by lower intracellular concentrations of arsenic. The slowly accumulated intracellular ATO through liposomal delivery might act as a reservoir which releases ATO gradually to maintain its anti-HPV effects. To conclude, liposome-delivered ATO could protect cells from the direct toxic effects induced by higher concentrations of intracellular ATO. Different pathways may be involved in this process, depending on local architecture of the tissues and HPV status.",,"['Wang, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Dong', 'Ghali, Lucy', 'Xia, Ruidong', 'Munoz, Leonardo P', 'Garelick, Hemda', 'Bell, Celia', 'Wen, Xuesong']","['Wang X', 'Li D', 'Ghali L', 'Xia R', 'Munoz LP', 'Garelick H', 'Bell C', 'Wen X']","['Centre for Investigative and Diagnostic Oncology, Middlesex University, London, NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Centre for Investigative and Diagnostic Oncology, Middlesex University, London, NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, The Burroughs, NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Centre for Investigative and Diagnostic Oncology, Middlesex University, London, NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, The Burroughs, NW4 4BT, UK.', ""Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Organic Electronics and Information Displays (KLOEID), Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT), 9 Wenyuan Road, Nanjing, 210046, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, The Burroughs, NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, The Burroughs, NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, The Burroughs, NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Centre for Investigative and Diagnostic Oncology, Middlesex University, London, NW4 4BT, UK. x.wen@mdx.ac.uk.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, The Burroughs, NW4 4BT, UK. x.wen@mdx.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160218,United States,Nanoscale Res Lett,Nanoscale research letters,101279750,,,,PMC4759142,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'Cervical cancer', 'Double immunostaining', 'HPV-E6', 'Liposomal nanotechnology', 'Liposome']",2016/02/19 06:00,2016/02/19 06:01,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s11671-016-1307-y [doi]', '10.1186/s11671-016-1307-y [pii]']",ppublish,Nanoscale Res Lett. 2016 Dec;11(1):94. doi: 10.1186/s11671-016-1307-y.

METHOD: The clinical, laboratory characteristics, treatment and prognosis of 132 children with WAS, who visited Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from April 2000 to June 2015, were analyzed retrospectively. RESULT: All patients were male. The median age of disease onset was 15 days and the median age at diagnosis was 10 months. Of the 132 cases, 112 had classic WAS, 20 had X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT). The median platelet count was 23x10(9)/L. All cases had the clinical characteristics of WAS including bleeding, eczema, and being susceptible to infection. The initial symptoms include hemorrhage (75.0%) and eczema (16.7%). Twenty-one cases had autoimmune diseases and one patient had leukemia. WAS protein (WASP) expression in 115 cases were measured by flow cytometry, 88 cases were negative, in 12 cases WASP decreased, in 5 cases it was normal, 10 cases had bimodal distribution. Eighty-one kinds of mutations were found in 122 families, including eight kinds of hot-spot mutations, which were 290 C> N / 291G> N (R86C / H / L), 665 C> T (R211X), 155 C> T (R41X), 168 C> T (T45 M), IVS1+ 1 g> t/ a, IVS6 + 5 g> a, IVS8 + 1 g> a and IVS8 + 1to + 6del gtga.

Mouse models have demonstrated the relevance of the expression of estrogen-modulated paracrine factors to uterine receptivity and implantation window. More importantly, some factors seem to serve as molecular links between different estrogen pathways, promoting cell growth, acting as molecular chaperones, or amplifying estrogenic effects. Abnormal expression of these factors can lead to implantation failure and infertility. This review provides an overview of several well-characterized signaling pathways that elucidates the molecular cross talk involved in the uterus during early pregnancy.",['(c) 2016 Society for Endocrinology.'],"['Robertshaw, I', 'Bian, F', 'Das, S K']","['Robertshaw I', 'Bian F', 'Das SK']","[""Department of Obstetrics and GynecologyUniversity of Cincinnati, West Chester, Ohio, USA Division of Reproductive SciencesCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Reproductive SciencesCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA Perinatal InstituteCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Reproductive SciencesCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA Perinatal InstituteCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA Department of PediatricsUniversity of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA sanjoy.das@cchmc.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160217,England,J Mol Endocrinol,Journal of molecular endocrinology,8902617,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (COUP Transcription Factor II)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'COUP Transcription Factor II/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/chemistry/metabolism', 'Estrogens/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gestational Age', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mucous Membrane/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Receptors, Estrogen/chemistry/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",PMC4889031,['NOTNLM'],"['*estrogen', '*implantation', '*pregnancy', '*signaling', '*uterus']",2016/02/19 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['JME-15-0300 [pii]', '10.1530/JME-15-0300 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Endocrinol. 2016 Apr;56(3):R127-38. doi: 10.1530/JME-15-0300.

In about 30% of cases, HER2/neu is expressed on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and was proposed to be associated with a deleterious prognosis. Here we evaluated clinical data from 65 ALL patients (HER2/neu+, n = 17; HER2/neu-, n = 48) with a median follow-up of 19.4 months (range 0.6-176.5 months) and observed no association of HER2/neu expression with response to chemotherapy, disease free or overall survival. In vitro, treatment of primary ALL cells (CD20+HER2/neu+, CD20+HER2/neu- and CD20-HER2/neu-) with Rituximab and Trastuzumab led to activation of NK cells in strict dependence of the expression of the respective antigen. NK reactivity was more pronounced with Rituximab as compared to Trastuzumab, and combined application could lead to additive effects in cases where both antigens were expressed.

In the past, treatment for acalculous cholecystitis has been cholecystectomy; however, many children who are critically ill are Percutaneous cholecystostomy is likely the procedure of choice in this subgroup of patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous cholecystostomy in critically ill and immune-compromised children with acalculous cholecystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of immune-compromised and critically ill children who underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy between 2006 and 2013. Diagnostic imaging performed included ultrasound, CT and hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Every percutaneous cholecystostomy was performed using imaging guidance. RESULTS: Ten critically ill and immune-compromised children with acalculous cholecystitis underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy. Seven boys and 3 girls, ranging in age from 10 months to 15 years 8 months, were treated. Six of the immune-compromised children had received a bone marrow transplant for leukemia (5 children) or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (1 child), and ranged from 18 to 307 days post bone marrow transplant at the time of their percutaneous cholecystostomy. Of the remaining four immune-compromised children with acalculous cholecystitis who underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy, two had leukemia, one had SCID and lymphoma, and the fourth was undergoing treatment for undifferentiated germ cell tumor. The 10 percutaneous gallbladder drains were placed using a transhepatic approach, except one unintentional transperitoneal approach. There were no complications. Three gallbladder drains were removed in Interventional Radiology. Those three patients had a return to normal gallbladder function and didn't require cholecystectomy. Two drains were removed during cholecystectomy and another as an outpatient. Four patients died in the hospital due to multiorgan system failure, with indwelling gallbladder drains. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous cholecystostomy is a safe procedure in immune-compromised and critically ill children with acalculous cholecystitis. Percutaneous cholecystostomy may obviate the need for future cholecystectomy.",,"['Schaefer, Carrie M', 'Towbin, Richard B', 'Aria, David J', 'Kaye, Robin D']","['Schaefer CM', 'Towbin RB', 'Aria DJ', 'Kaye RD']","[""Department of Medical Imaging, Phoenix Children's Hospital, 1919 E.

The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of omega (omega)-3 fatty acid on As2O3-induced cardiac toxicity in in vivo and in vitro settings. In in vivo experiments, male Wistar rats were orally administered with As2O3 4 mg/kg body weight for a period of 45 days and cardiotoxicity was assessed. As2O3 significantly increased the tissue arsenic deposition, micronuclei frequency and creatine kinase (CK)-MB activity. There were a rise in lipid peroxidation and a decline in reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase and catalase in heart tissue of arsenic-administered rats. The cardioprotective role of omega-3 fatty acid was assessed by combination treatment with As2O3. omega-3 fatty acid co-administration with As2O3 significantly alleviated these changes. In in vitro study using H9c2 cardiomyocytes, As2O3 treatment induced alterations in cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, lipid peroxidation, cellular calcium levels and mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim). omega-3 fatty acid co-treatment significantly increased cardiomyocyte viability, reduced LDH release, lipid peroxidation and intracellular calcium concentration and improved the Psim.

However, the molecular mechanism of how these factors regulate the activity of MLL proteins still remains poorly understood. Here we show that a minimized human RBBP5-ASH2L heterodimer is the structural unit that interacts with and activates all MLL family histone methyltransferases.

C-H bonds are present in almost all pharmaceutical agents. Consequently, the development of selective, rapid and efficient methods for converting these bonds into new chemical entities has the potential to streamline pharmaceutical development. Saturated nitrogen-containing heterocycles (alicyclic amines) feature prominently in pharmaceuticals, such as treatments for depression (paroxetine, amitifadine), diabetes (gliclazide), leukaemia (alvocidib), schizophrenia (risperidone, belaperidone), malaria (mefloquine) and nicotine addiction (cytisine, varenicline). However, existing methods for the C-H functionalization of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, particularly at sites remote to nitrogen, remain extremely limited. Here we report a transannular approach to selectively manipulate the C-H bonds of alicyclic amines at sites remote to nitrogen. Our reaction uses the boat conformation of the substrates to achieve palladium-catalysed amine-directed conversion of C-H bonds to C-C bonds on various alicyclic amine scaffolds. We demonstrate this approach by synthesizing new derivatives of several bioactive molecules, including varenicline.",,"['Topczewski, Joseph J', 'Cabrera, Pablo J', 'Saper, Noam I', 'Sanford, Melanie S']","['Topczewski JJ', 'Cabrera PJ', 'Saper NI', 'Sanford MS']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, 930 N.

We investigated the in vitro activity of bendamustine combined with other antimetabolite drugs on B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cell lines established from pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed ALL. We also developed a mathematically drown improved isobologram method to assess the data objectively. Three BCP-ALL cell lines; YCUB-2, YCUB-5, and YCUB-6, were simultaneously exposed to various concentrations of bendamustine and cladribine, cytarabine, fludarabine, or clofarabine. Cell growth inhibition was determined using the WST-8 assay. Combinatorial effects were estimated using our improved isobologram method with IC80 (drug concentration corresponding to 80 % of maximum inhibition). Bendamustine alone inhibited ALL cell growth with mean IC80 values of 11.30-18.90 mug/ml. Combinations of bendamustine with other drugs produced the following effects: (1) cladribine; synergistic-to-additive on all cell lines; (2) cytarabine; synergistic-to-additive on YCUB-5 and YCUB-6, and synergistic-to-antagonistic on YCUB-2; (3) fludarabine; additive-to-antagonistic on YCUB-5, and synergistic-to-antagonistic on YCUB-2 and YCUB-6; (4) clofarabine; additive-to-antagonistic on all cell lines.

To extend our knowledge of subtle genetic alterations involved in APL that might cooperate with PML/RARA in the leukemogenic process, we performed a comprehensive analysis of somatic mutations in APL combining WES with sequencing of a custom panel of targeted genes by next-generation sequencing. To select a reduced subset of high confidence candidate driver genes, further in silico analysis were carried out. After prioritization and network analysis we found recurrent deleterious mutations in 8 individual genes (STAG2, U2AF1, SMC1A, USP9X, IKZF1, LYN, MYCBP2 and PTPN11) with a strong potential of being involved in APL pathogenesis. Our network analysis of multiple mutations provides a reliable approach to prioritize genes for additional analysis, improving our knowledge of the leukemogenesis interactome. Additionally, we have defined a functional module in the interactome of APL.

However, whether strand transfers occur at illegitimate sites and how this may affect retrovirus replication are not well understood. METHODS: The reverse transcription was carried out with reverse transcriptases (RTs) from HIV-1, HIV-2, and murine leukemia virus. The nascent complementary DNA fragments were directly cloned without polymerase chain reaction amplification. The sequences were compared with the template sequence to determine if new sequences contained mismatched sequences caused by illegitimate strand transfers. RESULTS: Among 1067 nascent reverse transcript sequences, most of them (72%) matched to the template sequences, although they randomly stopped across the RNA templates. The other 28% of them contained mismatched 3'-end sequences because of illegitimate strand transfers. Most of the illegitimate strand transfers (81%) were disassociated from RNA templates and realigned onto opposite complementary DNA strands. Up to 3 strand transfers were detected in a single sequence, whereas most of them (93%) contained 1 strand transfer. Because most of the illegitimate strand-transfer fragments were generated from templates at 2 opposite orientations, they resulted in defective viral genomes and could not be detected by previous methods. Further analysis showed that mutations at pause/disassociation sites resulted in significantly higher strand-transfer rates.

It Depends on Where You Look.,159-73,10.1089/jayao.2015.0049 [doi],"PURPOSE: The adolescent and young adult (AYA) population is a growing group of survivors, exceeding more than 600,000, at high risk for late effects of cancer-directed therapy. While many guidelines exist for cancer survivorship care, choosing which to use for an AYA cancer survivor is challenging, yet vital, to ensure comprehensive follow-up care. METHODS: Survivorship care plans (SCPs), including treatment summaries (TS) and follow-up care plans, were created for three clinical vignettes (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma). Four sets of guidelines were used, including the Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines (COG LTFU), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Age- Related Recommendations: AYA Oncology (NCCN-AYA), NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site (NCCN-Site), and NCCN Guidelines for Supportive Care: Survivorship (NCCN-Survivorship) and NCCN supplemental cancer screening guidelines. The follow-up care plans were compared across guidelines to determine the extent and nature of the similarities and differences concerning AYA cancer survivorship care. RESULTS: The guidelines disagree on the link between treatment exposures and late effects, the population to be screened, the screening test to be used, and the time interval of testing. Specific examples of this include screening for cardiac toxicity, breast cancer, and neurocognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: While many guidelines exist for AYA survivorship care, there is discordance among the recommendations. This has significant implications for the long-term follow-up care of an AYA survivor. This study offers solutions to harmonize guidelines in order to ensure comprehensive quality survivorship care for this population.",,"['Barthel, Erin M', 'Spencer, Katherine', 'Banco, Darcy', 'Kiernan, Elizabeth', 'Parsons, Susan']","['Barthel EM', 'Spencer K', 'Banco D', 'Kiernan E', 'Parsons S']","['1 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology Oncology, Floating Hospital for Children, Tufts Medical Center , Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center , Boston, Massachusetts.', '3 Tufts University School of Medicine , Boston, Massachusetts.', '3 Tufts University School of Medicine , Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center , Boston, Massachusetts.', '1 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology Oncology, Floating Hospital for Children, Tufts Medical Center , Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center , Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160217,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hodgkin lymphoma', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*late effects', '*osteosarcoma', '*survivorship']",2016/02/18 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/02/18 06:00'],"['2016/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jayao.2015.0049 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2016 Jun;5(2):159-73. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2015.0049.

Imatinib (IM) a selective inhibitor of C-KIT, is indicated for the treatment of KIT-positive unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, and has tripled the survival time of patients with metastatic GIST. However, the majority of patients develop IM-resistance and progress. Although IM elicits strong antiproliferative effects, it fails to induce sufficient levels of apoptosis; acquired IM-resistance and disease recurrence remain an issue, a more effective drug treatment is greatly needed. We examined the effect of a novel microtubule-targeting agent (MTA), pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine (PBOX)-15 in combination with IM on GIST cells. PBOX-15 decreased viability and in combination with IM synergistically enhanced apoptosis in both IM-sensitive and IM-resistant GIST cells, decreased the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, and enhanced activation of pro-caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The combination treatment also led to an enhanced inhibition of C-KIT-phosphorylation and inactivation of C-KIT-dependent signalling in comparison to either drug alone; CDC37, a key regulator of C-KIT in GIST was also dramatically decreased. Furthermore, PBOX-15 reduced CKII expression, an enzyme which regulates the expression of CDC37. In conclusion, our findings indicate the potential of PBOX-15 to improve the apoptotic response of IM in GIST cells and provide a more effective treatment option for GIST patients.",,"['Kinsella, Paula', 'Greene, Lisa M', 'Bright, Sandra A', 'Pollock, Jade K', 'Butini, Stefania', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Bauer, Sebastian', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Kinsella P', 'Greene LM', 'Bright SA', 'Pollock JK', 'Butini S', 'Campiani G', 'Bauer S', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. paulakinsella53@yahoo.com.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'European Research Centre for Drug Discovery & Development, DBCF, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'European Research Centre for Drug Discovery & Development, DBCF, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'West German Cancer Center, Medical Oncology, Essen, Germany.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160217,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (4-acetoxy-5-(1-(naphthyl))naphtho(2,3-b)pyrrolo(2,1-d)(1,4)oxazepine)', '0 (CDC37 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Chaperonins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chaperonins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Oxazepines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CDC37', 'CKII', 'CKIT', 'Gastrointestinal', 'Imatinib', 'Microtubules']",2016/02/18 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/18 06:00'],"['2015/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10637-016-0331-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-016-0331-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2016 Apr;34(2):159-67. doi: 10.1007/s10637-016-0331-1.

In the September 2 issue of Science Translational Medicine, Porter et al. present the clinical data and correlative analyses for 14 CLL patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania under the pilot clinical trial recently completed at that institution. The initial reports from this trial, published in 2011 documented robust clinical activity in a small cohort of treated patients accompanied by logarithmic expansion, contraction, and long-term functional persistence of engineered T cells, along with cytokine release syndrome as a side-effect of the treatment. In this latest report, updated data are presented from the initial cohort of patients, as well as clinical and correlative data from the remainder of the treated cohort. The robust clinical activity observed in the initial cohort continued to be observed in a subset of the subsequently-treated patients, with molecular remissions documented in that subset; however, in the expanded cohort a subset of partial and non-responding patients was also identified. Collectively, the results from this exciting trial provide evidence to suggest that cellular immunotherapy using engineered T cells is a viable option for treating CLL, reveal a likely requirement for robust in-vivo activation and persistence of engineered cells to effect complete responses, and also highlight the need for a more complete mechanistic understanding of the immune- and tumor- specific processes that define and dictate the success of this powerful treatment modality.",,"['Kalos, Michael']",['Kalos M'],"['Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, 450 East 29th street, New York, NY 10016 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160216,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,,,,PMC4754893,['NOTNLM'],"['Chimeric antigen receptor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia adoptive transfer', 'T cell']",2016/02/18 06:00,2016/02/18 06:01,['2016/02/18 06:00'],"['2015/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-016-0108-2 [doi]', '108 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2016 Feb 16;4:5. doi: 10.1186/s40425-016-0108-2. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study early death rate for elderly was found to be lower than previous reports whereas it was similar for those who were under age of 60. Better ECOG performance (ECOG performance score 0 and 1) and non-intensive treatment associated with lower early death rates, however APL-type disease associated with higher early death rates. ECOG performance score at diagnosis was found to be the most related independent factor with higher rate of early death in 15 days after treatment (P<0.001). Therefore we decided to understand the factors which were related with ECOG. WBC count at diagnosis was found to be the only related parameter with ECOG performance score. Leucocyte count at diagnosis appears like to have an indirect effect on early death in AML patients.

In this study, we examined whether Slug's ability to silence expression suppresses the growth of leukemia HL-60 cells and/or sensitizes leukemia HL-60 cells to adriamycin (ADR) through induction of apoptosis. METHODS: SLUG siRNA was transfected into the HL-60 and HL-60(ADR) cell lines (an adriamycin resistant cell line). The stably SLUG siRNA transfected HL-60 and HL-60(ADR) cells was transiently transfected with PUMA siRNA. The mRNA and protein expression of SLUG and PUMA were determined by Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assay. The effects of SLUG siRNA alone or combined with ADR or PUMA siRNA on growth and apoptosis in HL-60 and HL-60(ADR) cells was detected by MTT, ELISA and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. RESULTS: The results showed that SLUG was less expressed in the HL-60 cells, and high expressed in the HL-60(ADR) cells. Obvious down-regulation of SLUG mRNA and protein levels and up-regulation of PUMA mRNA and protein levels after SLUG siRNA transfection was showed in the HL-60(ADR) cells. Treatment with ADR induced SLUG mRNA and protein in the HL-60 cells. Significant positive correlation was observed between basal SLUG mRNA and protein and ADR sensitivity. SLUG gene silencing by SLUG siRNA transfection inhibited growth and induced apoptosis, and increased ADR killing of the HL-60 and HL-60(ADR) cell lines. After the SLUG siRNA transfected HL-60 and HL-60(ADR) cells was transiently transfected with PUMA siRNA, did not increase ADR killing of the HL-60 and HL-60(ADR) cell lines. CONCLUSION: SLUG level positively correlated with sensitivity to ADR.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of clusterin small interference RNA (siRNA) on the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. METHODS: siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine2000 reagent. Relative protein expressions were quantified by Western blot. Trypan blue assay was performed to assess tumor cell proliferation after siRNA transfection. The cytotoxic effect of clusterin siRNA on leukemic cells was measured using MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected using fluorescence microscopy assay. Migration and invasion was detected after clusterin was silenced. RESULTS: Clusterin siRNA clearly lowered clusterin protein levels in a time- dependent manner, leading to marked inhibition of cell survival, proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, clusterin down-regulation significantly enhanced the extent of HL-60 apoptotic cells.

The cells after treatment with the vehicle or 25 muM withaferin A for 1, 2, 4 and 8 h were examined using flow cytometric analysis. The results revealed that withaferin A treatment induced cell growth arrest at the S to G2/M phase transition of the cell cycle. Withaferin A treatment also induced the phosphorylation of stress signalling proteins, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, c-Jun, the heat shock protein 27 and protein kinase B within 0 to 16 h. These results were observed using multiplex technology and Western blotting analysis. Thus withaferin A induces stress response leading to cell death.

In this study, we found that overexpression of type A NPM1 gene mutation (NPM1-mA) enhanced the adhesive, migratory and invasive potential in THP-1 AML cells lacking mutated NPM1. NPM1-mA had up-regulated expression and gelatinolytic matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2)/MMP-9 activity, as assessed by real-time PCR, western blotting and gelatin zymography. Following immunoprecipitation analysis to identify the interaction of NPM1-mA with K-Ras, we focused on the effect of NPM1-mA overexpression on the Ras/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling axis and showed that NPM1-mA increased the MEK and ERK phosphorylation levels, as evaluated by western blotting. Notably, a specific inhibitor of the ERK/MAPK pathway (PD98059), but not p38/MAPK, JNK/MAPK or PI3-K/AKT inhibitors, markedly decreased the cell invasion numbers in a transwell assay. Further experiments demonstrated that blocking the ERK/MAPK pathway by PD98059 resulted in reduced MMP-2/9 protein levels and MMP-9 activity. Additionally, NPM1-mA overexpression had down-regulated gene expression and protein production of tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP-2) in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, evaluation of gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset revealed that MMP-2 was overexpressed in AML patient samples with NPM1 mutated and high MMP-2 expression associated with leukemic skin infiltration. Taken together, our results reveal that NPM1 mutations contribute to the invasive potential of AML cells through MMPs up-regulation via Ras/ERK MAPK signaling pathway activation and offer novel insights into the potential role of NPM1 mutations in leukemogenesis.",,"['Xian, Jingrong', 'Shao, Huiyuan', 'Chen, Xianchun', 'Zhang, Shuaishuai', 'Quan, Jing', 'Zou, Qin', 'Jin, Hongjun', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Xian J', 'Shao H', 'Chen X', 'Zhang S', 'Quan J', 'Zou Q', 'Jin H', 'Zhang L']","['1.

ONC201 is a first-in-class small molecule that activates p53-independent apoptosis, has a benign safety profile, and is in early clinical trials. We found that ONC201 caused p53-independent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cell lines and in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples from patients; these included samples from patients with genetic abnormalities associated with poor prognosis or cells that had developed resistance to the nongenotoxic agents ibrutinib and bortezomib. Moreover, ONC201 caused apoptosis in stem and progenitor AML cells and abrogated the engraftment of leukemic stem cells in mice while sparing normal bone marrow cells. ONC201 caused changes in gene expression similar to those caused by the unfolded protein response (UPR) and integrated stress responses (ISRs), which increase the translation of the transcription factor ATF4 through an increase in the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. However, unlike the UPR and ISR, the increase in ATF4 abundance in ONC201-treated hematopoietic cells promoted apoptosis and did not depend on increased phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. ONC201 also inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, likely through ATF4-mediated induction of the mTORC1 inhibitor DDIT4. Overexpression of BCL-2 protected against ONC201-induced apoptosis, and the combination of ONC201 and the BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199 synergistically increased apoptosis. Thus, our results suggest that by inducing an atypical ISR and p53-independent apoptosis, ONC201 has clinical potential in hematological malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Ishizawa, Jo', 'Kojima, Kensuke', 'Chachad, Dhruv', 'Ruvolo, Peter', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Jacamo, Rodrigo O', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Mu, Hong', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Tabe, Yoko', 'Allen, Joshua E', 'Wang, Zhiqiang', 'Ma, Wencai', 'Lee, Hans C', 'Orlowski, Robert', 'Sarbassov, Dos D', 'Lorenzi, Philip L', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Neelapu, Sattva S', 'McDonnell, Timothy', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Wang, Michael', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Davis, R Eric', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Ishizawa J', 'Kojima K', 'Chachad D', 'Ruvolo P', 'Ruvolo V', 'Jacamo RO', 'Borthakur G', 'Mu H', 'Zeng Z', 'Tabe Y', 'Allen JE', 'Wang Z', 'Ma W', 'Lee HC', 'Orlowski R', 'Sarbassov dos D', 'Lorenzi PL', 'Huang X', 'Neelapu SS', 'McDonnell T', 'Miranda RN', 'Wang M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Konopleva M', 'Davis RE', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

The etiological and genetic features of this heterogeneous syndrome have not yet been elucidated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey to collect clinical information and samples from patients with familial thrombocytopenia and/or hematological malignancies in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of IT. RESULTS: Among the 43 pedigrees with clinical samples, RUNX1 mutations were identified in 8 pedigrees (18.6%). While MYH9 and ANKRD26 mutations were identified in 2 and 1 pedigrees, respectively, no gene mutations were detected in the remaining 32 pedigrees from a panel of previously reported pathogenetic mutations. Clinical data were comparable between FPD/AML and non-FPD/AML probands. CONCLUSIONS: Our study clarified that it is unexpectedly difficult to diagnose FPD/AML based on clinical information alone, and thus, genetic testing is strongly recommended. Our survey also identified some pedigrees with a strong family history of myelodysplastic syndromes of unknown origin.

We evaluated blinatumomab in relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 3 + 3 design, phase I dose-escalation study determined adverse events and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous intravenous infusion blinatumomab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. Blinatumomab was administered over 4 or 8 weeks at seven different dose levels (0.5 to 90 mug/m(2)/day). End points were incidence of adverse events, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and overall response rate. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2011, 76 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory NHL, who included 14 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, were enrolled; 42 received treatment in the formal dose-escalation phase. Neurologic events were dose limiting, and 60 mug/m(2)/day was established as the MTD. Thirty-four additional patients were recruited to evaluate antilymphoma activity and strategies for mitigating neurologic events at a prespecified MTD. Stepwise dosing (5 to 60 mug/m(2)/day) plus pentosan polysulfate SP54 (n = 3) resulted in no treatment discontinuations; single-step (n = 5) and double-step (n = 24) dosing entailed two and seven treatment discontinuations due to neurologic events, respectively. Grade 3 neurologic events occurred in 22% of patients (no grade 4/5). Among patients treated at 60 mug/m(2)/day (target dose; n = 35), the overall response rate was 69% across NHL subtypes and 55% for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 11); median response duration was 404 days (95% CI, 207 to 1,129 days). CONCLUSION: In this phase I study of relapsed/refractory NHL, continuous infusion with CD19-targeted immunotherapy blinatumomab at various doses and schedules was feasible, with an MTD of 60 mug/m(2)/day. Single-agent blinatumomab showed antilymphoma activity.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Goebeler, Maria-Elisabeth', 'Knop, Stefan', 'Viardot, Andreas', 'Kufer, Peter', 'Topp, Max S', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Noppeney, Richard', 'Hess, Georg', 'Kallert, Stefan', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Rupertus, Kathrin', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Libicher, Martin', 'Nagorsen, Dirk', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard', 'Klinger, Matthias', 'Wolf, Andreas', 'Dorsch, Brigitte', 'Quednau, Beate D', 'Schmidt, Margit', 'Scheele, Jurgen', 'Baeuerle, Patrick A', 'Leo, Eugen', 'Bargou, Ralf C']","['Goebeler ME', 'Knop S', 'Viardot A', 'Kufer P', 'Topp MS', 'Einsele H', 'Noppeney R', 'Hess G', 'Kallert S', 'Mackensen A', 'Rupertus K', 'Kanz L', 'Libicher M', 'Nagorsen D', 'Zugmaier G', 'Klinger M', 'Wolf A', 'Dorsch B', 'Quednau BD', 'Schmidt M', 'Scheele J', 'Baeuerle PA', 'Leo E', 'Bargou RC']","['Maria-Elisabeth Goebeler, Stefan Knop, Max S.

This study sought to determine the accuracy of AE reporting for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia clinical trials and to test whether an external electronic data source can improve reporting. METHODS: Reported AEs were evaluated on two trials, Children's Oncology Group AAML03P1 and AAML0531 arm B, with identical chemotherapy regimens but with different toxicity reporting requirements. Chart review for 12 AEs for patients enrolled in AAML0531 at 14 hospitals was the gold standard. The sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) of the AAML0531 AE report and AEs detected by review of Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) billing and microbiology data were compared with chart data. RESULTS: Select AE rates from AAML03P1 and AAML0531 arm B differed significantly and correlated with the targeted toxicities of each trial. Chart abstraction was performed on 204 patients (758 courses) on AAML0531. AE report sensitivity was < 50% for eight AEs, but PPV was > 75% for six AEs. AE reports for viridans group streptococcal bacteremia, a targeted toxicity on AAML0531, had a sensitivity of 78.3% and PPV of 98.1%. PHIS billing data had higher sensitivity (> 50% for nine AEs), but lower PPV (< 75% for 10 AEs). Viridans group streptococcal detection using PHIS microbiology data had high sensitivity (92.3%) and PPV (97.3%). CONCLUSION: The current system of AE reporting for cooperative oncology group clinical trials in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia underestimates AE rates. The high sensitivity and PPV of PHIS microbiology data suggest that using external data sources may improve the accuracy of AE reporting.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Miller, Tamara P', 'Li, Yimei', 'Kavcic, Marko', 'Troxel, Andrea B', 'Huang, Yuan-Shun V', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert', 'Hall, Matt', 'Daves, Marla H', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Pollard, Jessica A', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Luger, Selina', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Miller TP', 'Li Y', 'Kavcic M', 'Troxel AB', 'Huang YS', 'Sung L', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing R', 'Hall M', 'Daves MH', 'Horton TM', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Pollard JA', 'Bagatell R', 'Seif AE', 'Fisher BT', 'Luger S', 'Gamis AS', 'Adamson PC', 'Aplenc R']","[""Tamara P.

To substantiate these preliminary findings, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Database was interrogated to analyze the impact of CMV reactivation on hematologic disease relapse in the current era. Data from 9469 patients transplanted with bone marrow or peripheral blood between 2003 and 2010 were analyzed according to 4 disease categories: AML (n = 5310); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 1883); chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n = 1079); and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 1197). Median time to initial CMV reactivation was 41 days (range, 1-362 days). CMV reactivation had no preventive effect on hematologic disease relapse irrespective of diagnosis. Moreover, CMV reactivation was associated with higher nonrelapse mortality [relative risk [RR] among disease categories ranged from 1.61 to 1.95 and P values from .0002 to <.0001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.61). As a result, CMV reactivation was associated with lower overall survival for AML (RR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17-1.38; P <.0001), ALL (RR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.25-1.71; P <.0001), CML (RR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.19-1.88; P = .0005), and MDS (RR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.57; P = .003).

In this study, anticancer and antiproliferative mechanism of biocompatible As2O3 nanoparticles was determined on human prostate cancer cell lines. MAIN METHODS: In vitro anticancer efficacy of biopolymer coated As2O3 NPs was investigated in LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines, by assessing DNA damage, changes in epigenetic modulations, expression level of apoptotic markers and cell cycle analysis following treatment with As2O3 NPs. KEY FINDINGS: Our results demonstrate that the nanoparticulate formulation of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and chitosan coated As2O3 is capable of inducing morphological changes, DNA damage and caspase-dependent apoptosis along with the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 by upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor - p21 was found to be triggered by changes in epigenetic modifications at histone tails. SIGNIFICANCE: Biopolymer coated As2O3 nanoparticles induced reversal of mono, di and tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 residue. Acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 14 residue and phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 residue synergistically activated p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene thereby leading to apoptosis in the LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Treatment with As2O3 nanoparticles arrested the cells in G0-G1 and G2-M phase of cell cycle in LNCaP and PC-3 cells respectively. Thus, biocompatible As2O3 nanoparticles with reduced toxicity to normal cells but the antiproliferative effect on prostate cancer cell lines follow similar death pathway as that of bare As2O3 nanoparticles.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Natural killer (NK) cells in particular have great potential for direct use in adoptive immunotherapy (AI) for cancer and to improve the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs). NK cell number and function are associated with a strong GVL effect without inducing graft-versus-host disease in most settings. Clinical trials demonstrating the therapeutic role of NK cells in HSCT recipients or testing the safety and efficacy of AI with NK cells have been primarily directed at treating acute myeloid leukemia, although investigators have used NK cells for treatment of other hematological diseases, sarcomas, carcinomas, and brain tumors. Major challenges must be overcome in making NK cell-based therapy cost-effective, the most important being the need to collect or generate an adequate number of effector cells. In this review, we discuss protocols for isolation, expansion, and in vitro propagation of large quantities of functional NK cells that meet the criteria for clinical applications. Among the methods described are the use of bioreactors for scaling up production and expansion of NK cells in the presence of interleukins and feeder cells. We also discuss novel methodologies that optimize the generation of clinical grade NK-cell products for AI.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Mda-7/IL-24 has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various human tumor cell lines, but its effect on the sensitivity of B cell lymphoma to chemotherapy agents is not yet clear. The present study investigated the effects of Mda-7/IL-24 overexpression on the sensitivity of human B cell lymphoma cells to chemotherapy, as well as its mechanism of action. The sensitivity of stable Mda-7/IL-24 overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP), epirubicin and vinblastine (VCR) were assessed by the MTS method, and the IC50 value calculated. Cell apoptosis and the intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine-123 were assayed by flow cytometry. The expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1), topoisomerase II (Topo II) and multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) mRNA and protein were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. In addition, western blot analysis was also used to investigate the effect of Mda-7/IL-24 on activity of GTP-RhoA-ERK signaling pathway in Raji and Daudi cells. Growth inhibition and apoptosis rates of Mda-7/IL-24 overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells were higher than those of non-transfected cells and cells transfected with vector alone when treated with CDDP, epirubicin and VCR. The IC50 values of CDDP, epirubicin and VCR were lower for Mda-7/IL-24-overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells than for non-transfected cells and cells transfected with empty vector. Intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine-123 and the expression of Topo II were higher, while the levels of MDR1, BMI and MRP1 mRNA and protein were lower, in Mda-7/IL-24 overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells. Furthermore, the activities of GTP-RhoA-ERK signaling pathway in Raji and Daudi cells were suppressed. These results indicated that Mda-7/IL-24 enhanced the sensitivity of B lymphoma cells to chemotherapy agents by altering the expression of multidrug-resistance genes via downregulating GTP-RhoA-ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that treatment of B cell lymphomas with Mda-7/IL-24 could avoid MDR.",,"['Ma, Ming', 'Zhao, Lianmei', 'Sun, Guogui', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Liu, Lihua', 'Du, Yanyan', 'Yang, Xingxiao', 'Shan, Baoen']","['Ma M', 'Zhao L', 'Sun G', 'Zhang C', 'Liu L', 'Du Y', 'Yang X', 'Shan B']","['Clinical Laboratory, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050011, P.R.

Mutation in MLL2, encoding a histone methyltransferase, is a driver in numerous different cancer types, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we present evidence that MLL2 mutation results in genome instability. Mouse cells in which MLL2 gene deletion can be induced display elevated levels of sister chromatid exchange, gross chromosomal aberrations, 53BP1 foci, and micronuclei. Human MLL2 knockout cells are characterized by genome instability as well. Interestingly, MLL2 interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and RECQL5, and, although MLL2 mutated cells have normal overall H3K4me levels in genes, nucleosomes in the immediate vicinity of RNAPII are hypomethylated. Importantly, MLL2 mutated cells display signs of substantial transcription stress, and the most affected genes overlap with early replicating fragile sites, show elevated levels of gammaH2AX, and suffer frequent mutation. The requirement for MLL2 in the maintenance of genome stability in genes helps explain its widespread role in cancer and points to transcription stress as a strong driver in tumorigenesis.",['(c) 2016 Kantidakis et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Kantidakis, Theodoros', 'Saponaro, Marco', 'Mitter, Richard', 'Horswell, Stuart', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Boeing, Stefan', 'Aygun, Ozan', 'Kelly, Gavin P', 'Matthews, Nik', 'Stewart, Aengus', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Svejstrup, Jesper Q']","['Kantidakis T', 'Saponaro M', 'Mitter R', 'Horswell S', 'Kranz A', 'Boeing S', 'Aygun O', 'Kelly GP', 'Matthews N', 'Stewart A', 'Stewart AF', 'Svejstrup JQ']","['Mechanisms of Transcription Laboratory, Clare Hall Laboratories, The Francis Crick Institute, South Mimms EN6 3LD, United Kingdom;', 'Mechanisms of Transcription Laboratory, Clare Hall Laboratories, The Francis Crick Institute, South Mimms EN6 3LD, United Kingdom;', 'Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Group, The Francis Crick Institute, London WC2A 3LY, United Kingdom;', 'Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Group, The Francis Crick Institute, London WC2A 3LY, United Kingdom;', 'Biotechnologisches Zentrum, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01062 Dresden, Germany;', 'Mechanisms of Transcription Laboratory, Clare Hall Laboratories, The Francis Crick Institute, South Mimms EN6 3LD, United Kingdom;', 'Mechanisms of Transcription Laboratory, Clare Hall Laboratories, The Francis Crick Institute, South Mimms EN6 3LD, United Kingdom;', 'Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Group, The Francis Crick Institute, London WC2A 3LY, United Kingdom;', 'Advanced Sequencing Facility, The Francis Crick Institute, London WC2A 3LY, United Kingdom.', 'Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Group, The Francis Crick Institute, London WC2A 3LY, United Kingdom;', 'Biotechnologisches Zentrum, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01062 Dresden, Germany;', 'Mechanisms of Transcription Laboratory, Clare Hall Laboratories, The Francis Crick Institute, South Mimms EN6 3LD, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)', 'EC 5.99.- (Recql5 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'Genomic Instability/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RecQ Helicases/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",PMC4762426,['NOTNLM'],"['KMT2D', 'MLL2', 'cancer', 'genomic instability', 'mutation', 'transcription']",2016/02/18 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2016/02/18 06:00'],"['2016/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['30/4/408 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.275453.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2016 Feb 15;30(4):408-20. doi: 10.1101/gad.275453.115.,,['09-0730/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As p53 plays a key role in regulating proliferation or apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapies, strategies aimed at reactivating p53 are increasingly being sought. Strategies to reactivate wild-type p53 include the use of small molecules capable of releasing wild-type p53 from key, cellular negative regulators, such as Hdm2 and HdmX. Derivatives of the Hdm2 antagonist Nutlin-3 are in clinical trials. However, Nutlin-3 specifically disrupts Hdm2-p53, leaving tumors harboring high levels of HdmX resistant to Nutlin-3 treatment. Here, we identify CTX1, a novel small molecule that overcomes HdmX-mediated p53 repression. CTX1 binds directly to HdmX to prevent p53-HdmX complex formation, resulting in the rapid induction of p53 in a DNA damage-independent manner. Treatment of a panel of cancer cells with CTX1 induced apoptosis or suppressed proliferation and, importantly, CTX1 demonstrates promising activity as a single agent in a mouse model of circulating primary human leukemia. CTX1 is a small molecule HdmX inhibitor that demonstrates promise as a cancer therapeutic candidate. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(4); 574-82.

We enrolled patients with acute myeloid leukemia (n = 197) and acute lymphoid leukemia (n = 192) who underwent allogeneic-HSCT in first remission. We measured RQ-PCR weekly to detect CMV-reactivation and preemptively used ganciclovir (GCV) when the titer increased twice consecutively, but GCV was sometimes delayed in patients without significant graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) by reducing immunosuppressive agents. In the entire group, CMV-reactivation showed poor overall survival (OS). To evaluate subsequent effects of CMV-reactivation, we excluded early relapse and deaths within 100 days, during which most of the CMV-reactivation occurred.

The mechanisms leading to aberrant activation of TAL1 in T-ALL patients who lack chromosomal rearrangements involving the TAL1 locus remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that TAL1 levels decrease during normal T-cell development at least in part due to miRNA-dependent silencing, in which case TAL1 over-expression in some T-ALL cases could be the consequence of deregulated miRNA expression. By performing computational prediction of miRNAs that bind to the human TAL1 mRNA we compiled a list of miRNAs that are candidates to regulate TAL1. Using a luciferase reporter system and mutagenesis assays we confirmed the miRNA-TAL1 mRNA interactions and selected candidate miRNAs: miR-101, miR-520d-5p, miR-140-5p, miR-448 and miR-485-5p. Over-expression of these microRNAs in different T-ALL cell lines consistently resulted in the down-regulation of TAL1 protein. In accordance, inhibition of miR-101 and miR-520d-5p promoted TAL1 protein expression. Importantly, we found that miR-101, miR-140-5p, miR-448 and miR-485-5p were down-regulated in T-ALL patient specimens and T-ALL cell lines. Our results show for the first time the existence of epigenetic regulation of TAL1 by specific miRNAs which may contribute, at least in part, to the ectopic expression of TAL1 in some T-ALL cases.",,"['Correia, Nadia C', 'Melao, Alice', 'Povoa, Vanda', 'Sarmento, Leonor', 'Gomez de Cedron, Marta', 'Malumbres, Marcos', 'Enguita, Francisco J', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Correia NC', 'Melao A', 'Povoa V', 'Sarmento L', 'Gomez de Cedron M', 'Malumbres M', 'Enguita FJ', 'Barata JT']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Cell Division and Cancer Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cell Division and Cancer Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4884991,['NOTNLM'],"['T-ALL', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'TAL1', 'microRNAs', 'post-transcriptional regulation']",2016/02/18 06:00,2016/12/21 06:00,['2016/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['6987 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6987 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Feb 16;7(7):8268-81. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6987.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Underlying unreported conditions could have introduced bias into these findings. METHODS: We collected and reviewed additional clinical information from radiology information systems (RIS) databases, underlying cause of death and pathology reports. We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding participants with cancer-predisposing conditions or previous unreported cancers and compared the dose-response analyses with our original results. RESULTS: We obtained information from the RIS and death certificates for about 40% of the cohort (n approximately 180 000) and found cancer-predisposing conditions in 4 out of 74 leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases and 13 out of 135 brain tumour cases. As these conditions were unrelated to CT exposure, exclusion of these participants did not alter the dose-response relationships. We found evidence of previous unreported cancers in 2 leukaemia/MDS cases, 7 brain tumour cases and 232 in non-cases. These previous cancers were related to increased number of CTs. Exclusion of these cancers reduced the excess relative risk per mGy by 15% from 0.036 to 0.033 for leukaemia/MDS (P-trend=0.02) and by 30% from 0.023 to 0.016 (P-trend<0.0001) for brain tumours. When we included pathology reports we had additional clinical information for 90% of the cases. Additional exclusions from these reports further reduced the risk estimates, but this sensitivity analysis may have underestimated risks as reports were only available for cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was evidence of some bias in our original risk estimates, re-analysis of the cohort with additional clinical data still showed an increased cancer risk after low-dose radiation exposure from CT scans in young patients.",,"['Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy', 'Salotti, Jane A', 'McHugh, Kieran', 'Little, Mark P', 'Harbron, Richard W', 'Lee, Choonsik', 'Ntowe, Estelle', 'Braganza, Melissa Z', 'Parker, Louise', 'Rajaraman, Preetha', 'Stiller, Charles', 'Stewart, Douglas R', 'Craft, Alan W', 'Pearce, Mark S']","['Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'Salotti JA', 'McHugh K', 'Little MP', 'Harbron RW', 'Lee C', 'Ntowe E', 'Braganza MZ', 'Parker L', 'Rajaraman P', 'Stiller C', 'Stewart DR', 'Craft AW', 'Pearce MS']","['Radiation Epidemiology Unit, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London WC1N 3JH, UK.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Unit, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Unit, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Unit, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Unit, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Paediatrics, Population Cancer Research Program, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Unit, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'New College, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Unit, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK.', 'Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC4815765,,,2016/02/18 06:00,2016/08/18 06:00,['2016/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2015415 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2015.415 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2016 Feb 16;114(4):388-94. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2015.415.,,"['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmaceutical industry is looking for cost-effective alternatives with reduced risks of drug failure. Validated target machinery along with established inhibitors indicates usefulness in drug design, discovery and further development. Folate metabolism, found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, represents an essential druggable target for chemotherapy. Numerous enzymes in the cell replication cycle use folate either as a cofactor or as a substrate. DHFR, an enzyme of the folate biosynthesis pathway is an established chemotherapeutic target, initially explored for anti-cancer drug discovery. Diaminopteridines e.g. methotrexate and aminopterin, primarily used as anti-cancer agents, are folic acid analogues, first reported in late 1940's, used to produce temporary remission of acute leukaemia in children. However, due to the toxicity of these drugs, they could not be used for other therapeutic implications such as in the treatment of infectious diseases. Development of newer diaminopteridine derivatives has helped in repositioning their therapeutic usefulness. These analogues have now been proven as anti-parasitic, immuno-suppressants, anti-bacterial agents, to enlist a few therapeutic applications.

Due to their analogy to hematopoietic stem cells, these cells have been named ""leukemia stem cells,"" and are thought to be chiefly responsible for disease relapse and ultimate survival after chemotherapy. Core Binding Factor (CBF) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is cytogenetically characterized by either the t(8;21) or the inv(16)/t(16;16) chromosomal abnormalities, which, although being pathognomonic, are not sufficient per se to induce overt leukemia but rather determine a preclinical phase of disease when preleukemic subclones compete until the acquisition of clonal dominance by one of them. In this review we summarize the concepts regarding the application of the ""leukemia stem cell"" theory to the development of CBF AML; we will analyze the studies investigating the leukemogenetic role of t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16), the proposed theories of its clonal evolution, and the role played by the hematopoietic niches in preserving the disease. Finally, we will discuss the clinical implications of stem cell modeling of CBF AML for the therapy of the disease.",,"['Mosna, Federico', 'Gottardi, Michele']","['Mosna F', 'Gottardi M']","[""Hematology, Department of Specialty Medicine, Ospedale Santa Maria di Ca' Foncello, Piazza Ospedale 1, 31100 Treviso, Italy."", ""Hematology, Department of Specialty Medicine, Ospedale Santa Maria di Ca' Foncello, Piazza Ospedale 1, 31100 Treviso, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160113,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,PMC4737463,,,2016/02/18 06:00,2016/02/18 06:01,['2016/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/7625827 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Int. 2016;2016:7625827. doi: 10.1155/2016/7625827.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are fast-cycling (those in adults instead are largely quiescent) and studies in mice demonstrated that their relative contribution to myelo- and lymphopoiesis varies during development. We hypothesize that during development some of the ""hits"" needed for the onset of leukemia are usually occurring (being part of the normal development), so leukemogenesis needs less mutations than in adults to take place and therefore it's more probable. The switch between the relative incidence of acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias may be related to the changes of the percentage of lymphoid-deficient and lymphoid-proficient sub-set of HSCs during development. Further investigations may clarify this hypothesis, elucidating also the roles of the different microenvironments in determining the myeloid/lymphoid predisposition of the HSCs.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These agents antagonize the anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family. The Bcl-2 proteins modulate sensitivity of many types of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to examine and compare the antileukemic activity of obatoclax and ABT-737 applied alone, and in combination with anticancer agent, mafosfamide and daunorubicin. The in vitro cytotoxic effects of the tested agents on human leukemia cells were determined using the spectrophotometric MTT test, Coulter electrical impedance method, flow cytometry annexin V-fluorescein/propidium iodide assay, and light microscopy technique. The combination index analysis was used to quantify the extent of agent interactions. BH3 mimetics significantly decreased the leukemia cell viability and synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effects induced by mafosfamide and daunorubicin. Obatoclax affected the cell viability to a greater degree than did ABT-737. In addition, various patterns of temporary changes in the cell volume and count, and in the frequency of leukemia cells undergoing apoptosis, were found 24 and 48 h after the tested agent application. ABT-737 combined with anticancer agents induced apoptosis more effectively than obatoclax when given in the same combination regimen. The results of the present study point to the different antileukemic activities of obatoclax and ABT-737, when applied alone, and in combination with anticancer agents.

Disruption of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms is widespread in cancer cells and largely contributes to the transformation process through active repression of tumor suppressor genes. While mutations of epigenetic regulators have been reported in various lymphoid malignancies and solid cancers, mutation of these genes in HTLV-I-associated T-cell leukemia has not been investigated. METHOD: Here we used whole genome next generation sequencing (NGS) of uncultured freshly isolated ATL samples and identified the presence of mutations in SUZ12, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1, TET2, IDH1, IDH2, MLL, MLL2, MLL3 and MLL4. RESULTS: TET2 was the most frequently mutated gene, occurring in 32 % (10/31) of ATL samples analyzed. Interestingly, NGS revealed nonsense mutations accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in TET2 and MLL3, which was further confirmed by cloning and direct sequencing of DNA from uncultured cells. Finally, direct sequencing of matched control and tumor samples revealed that TET2 mutation was present only in ATL tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that inactivation of MLL3 and TET2 may play an important role in the tumorigenesis process of HTLV-I-induced ATL.",,"['Yeh, Chien-Hung', 'Bai, Xue Tao', 'Moles, Ramona', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Yeh CH', 'Bai XT', 'Moles R', 'Ratner L', 'Waldmann TA', 'Watanabe T', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Pathology, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room 4 N/115, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genome Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genome Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA. cnicot@kumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160216,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2C protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Reference Standards']",PMC4754821,,,2016/02/18 06:00,2016/10/01 06:00,['2016/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-016-0500-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-016-0500-z [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2016 Feb 16;15:15. doi: 10.1186/s12943-016-0500-z.,,"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,"['Mol Cancer. 2016;15:20.

However, experimental data are scarce and findings inconsistent. Here, we investigated the role of the SNS during acute infection with Friend virus (FV), a pathogenic murine retrovirus that causes polyclonal proliferation of erythroid precursor cells and splenomegaly in adult mice. Experimental animals were infected with FV complex, and viral load, spleen weight, and splenic noradrenaline (NA) concentration was analyzed until 25 days post infection. Results show that FV infection caused a massive but transient depletion in splenic NA during the acute phase of the disease. At the peak of the virus-induced splenomegaly, splenic NA concentration was reduced by about 90% compared to naive uninfected mice. Concurrently, expression of the catecholamine degrading enzymes monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) was significantly upregulated in immune cells of the spleen. Pharmacological inhibition of MAO-A and COMT by the selective inhibitors clorgyline and 3,5-dinitrocatechol, respectively, efficiently blocked NA degradation and significantly reduced viral load and virus-induced splenomegaly. In contrast, chemical sympathectomy prior to FV inoculation aggravated the acute infection and extended the duration of the disease. Together these findings demonstrate that catecholamine availability at the site of viral replication is an important factor affecting the course of retroviral infections.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the cellular mechanisms by which rituximab exerts its antilymphoma activity are only partially understood. We show here that rituximab induces typical features of cellular senescence, a long-term growth arrest of viable cells with distinct biologic properties, in established B-cell lymphoma cell lines as well as primary transformed B cells. In addition, rituximab-based immunotherapy sensitized lymphoma cells to senescence induction by the chemotherapeutic compound adriamycin (a.k.a. doxorubicin), and, to a lesser extent, by the antimicrotubule agent vincristine. Anti-CD20 treatment further enhanced secretion of senescence-associated cytokines, and augmented the DNA damage response signaling cascade triggered by adriamycin. As the underlying prosenescence mechanism, we found intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to be elevated in response to rituximab, and, in turn, the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine to largely abrogate rituximab-mediated senescence. Our results, further supported by gene set enrichment analyses in a clinical data set of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient samples exposed to a rituximab-containing treatment regimen, provide important mechanistic insights into the biologic complexity of anti-CD20-evoked tumor responses, and unveil cellular senescence as a hitherto unrecognized effector principle of the antibody component in lymphoma immunochemotherapy.

In the present paper, indoor measurements of naturally occurring gamma rays that were undertaken as part of the UK Childhood Cancer Study are summarised, and it is shown that these are broadly compatible with an earlier UK National Survey. The distribution of indoor gamma-ray dose rates in Great Britain is approximately normal with mean 96 nGy/h and standard deviation 23 nGy/h. Directly ionising cosmic rays contribute about one-third of the total. The expanded dataset allows a more detailed description than previously of indoor gamma-ray exposures and in particular their geographical variation. Various strategies for predicting indoor natural background gamma-ray dose rates were explored. In the first of these, a geostatistical model was fitted, which assumes an underlying geologically determined spatial variation, superimposed on which is a Gaussian stochastic process with Matern correlation structure that models the observed tendency of dose rates in neighbouring houses to correlate. In the second approach, a number of dose-rate interpolation measures were first derived, based on averages over geologically or administratively defined areas or using distance-weighted averages of measurements at nearest-neighbour points. Linear regression was then used to derive an optimal linear combination of these interpolation measures. The predictive performances of the two models were compared via cross-validation, using a randomly selected 70 % of the data to fit the models and the remaining 30 % to test them.

Standard treatment is supportive care of the arising symptoms including red blood cell transfusions or the administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in the case of anaemia or the treatment with granulocyte (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factors (GM-CSF) in cases of neutropenia. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess the evidence for the treatment of patients with MDS with G-CSF and GM-CSF in addition to standard therapy in comparison to the same standard therapy or the same standard therapy and placebo. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (from 1950 to 3 December 2015) and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until 3 December 2015), as well as conference proceedings (American Society of Hematology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Hematology Association, European Society of Medical Oncology) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two review authors independently screened search results. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs examining G-CSF or GM-CSF in addition to standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed MDS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used hazard ratios (HR) as effect measure for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression, and risk ratios for response rates, adverse events, antibiotic use and hospitalisation. Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Investigators of two trials were contacted for subgroup information, however, no further data were provided. G-CSF and GM-CSF were analysed separately. MAIN RESULTS: We screened a total of 566 records. Seven RCTs involving 486 patients were identified, but we could only meta-analyse the two evaluating GM-CSF. We judged the potential risk of bias of these trials as unclear, mostly due to missing information. All trials were randomised and open-label studies. However, three trials were published as abstracts only, therefore we were not able to assess the potential risk of bias for these trials in detail. Overall, data were not reported in a comparable way and patient-related outcomes like survival, time to progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or the incidence of infections was reported in two trials only.Five RCTs (N = 337) assessed the efficacy of G-CSF in combination with standard therapy (supportive care, chemotherapy or erythropoietin). We were not able to perform meta-analyses for any of the pre-planned outcomes due to inconsistent and insufficient reporting of data. There is no evidence for a difference for overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.47), progression-free survival (only P value provided), progression to AML, incidence of infections and number of red blood transfusions (average number of 12 red blood cell transfusions in each arm). We judged the quality of evidence for all these outcomes as very low, due to very high imprecision and potential publication bias, as three trials were published as abstracts only. Data about quality of life and serious adverse events were not reported in any of the included trials.Two RCTs (N = 149) evaluated GM-CSF in addition to standard therapy (chemotherapy). For mortality (two RCTs; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26), we found no evidence for a difference (low-quality evidence). Data for progression-free survival and serious adverse events were not comparable across both studies, without evidence for a difference between both arms (low-quality evidence). For infections, red blood cell and platelet transfusions, we found no evidence for a difference, however, these outcomes were reported by one trial only (low-quality evidence). Time to progression to AML and quality of life were not reported at all.Moreover, we identified two cross-over trials, including 244 patients and evaluating GM-CSF versus placebo, without publishing results for each arm before crossing over. In addition, we identified two ongoing studies, one of which was discontinued due to withdrawal of pharmaceutical support, the other was terminated early, both without publishing results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although we identified seven trials with a total number of 486 patients, and two unpublished, prematurely finished studies, this systematic review mainly shows that there is a substantial lack of data, which might inform the use of G-CSF and GM-CSF for the prevention of infections, prolonging of survival and improvement of quality of life. The impact on progression to AML remains unclear.",,"['Hutzschenreuter, Franz', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Engert, Andreas', 'Skoetz, Nicole']","['Hutzschenreuter F', 'Monsef I', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Engert A', 'Skoetz N']","['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160216,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,,2016/02/18 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2016/02/17 06:00'],"['2016/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD009310.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Feb 16;2:CD009310. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009310.pub2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-eight patients enrolled between 2001 and 2005. A high rate of induction death (n = 3) or induction failure (n = 1) was observed. Among those who entered remission, five-year DFS is 80 +/- 8.9% for those at standard risk of relapse and 76 +/- 7.8% for high-risk patients, with median follow up over six years. The estimated cumulative incidence of testicular relapse among boys was elevated (13 +/- 7.2%) compared to the rate observed on contemporary protocols. We conclude that post-induction therapy using intensive oral antimetabolites for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can result in overall long-term DFS comparable to that observed among children treated with regimens including intravenous MTX.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview on childhood and adolescent cancers and to contribute to the future strategies to deal with these diseases in Bangladesh. METHODS: Data on malignant neoplasms in patients aged less than 20 years diagnosed between 2001 and 2014 (N = 3143) in Bangladesh was collected by the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital and ASHIC Foundation. The age pattern and distribution of cancer types were analysed and the incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence rate was 7.8 per million person-years for children (0-14 years) in the last time period (2011-2014). Retinoblastoma (25%) and leukaemia (18%) were the most common childhood cancers. For adolescents (15-19 years), the age-specific incidence rate was 2.1 per million person-years in the same time period. Most common adolescent cancers were malignant bone tumours (38%), germ cell and gonadal tumours (17%), and epithelial tumours (16%). There were more boys affected (M: F ratio 2.0 in children and 1.4 in adolescents) than girls. CONCLUSION: Cancer incidences were lower than expected most likely due to a low level of awareness about cancer among clinicians and the population, inadequate access to health care, lack of diagnostic equipment and incomplete recording of cases. Improvements on different levels should be made to get a better epidemiologic insight and to detect cancer earlier resulting in a better outcome for affected children and adolescents.",,"['Hossain, Mohammad Sorowar', 'Begum, Mamtaz', 'Mian, Md Mahmuduzzaman', 'Ferdous, Shameema', 'Kabir, Shahinur', 'Sarker, Humayun Kabir', 'Karim, Sabina', 'Choudhury, Salma', 'Khan, Asaduzzaman', 'Khan, Zohora Jameela', 'Karim-Kos, Henrike E']","['Hossain MS', 'Begum M', 'Mian MM', 'Ferdous S', 'Kabir S', 'Sarker HK', 'Karim S', 'Choudhury S', 'Khan A', 'Khan ZJ', 'Karim-Kos HE']","['Faculty of Basic Sciences, Bangladesh University of Health Sciences, Darus Salam, Mirpur-1, Dhaka, 1216, Bangladesh. sorowar.hossain@buhs.ac.bd.', 'National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. begum.dr.mamtaz@gmail.com.', 'Centre for Excellence, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh. zamanpabna085@gmail.com.', 'Talent Hub, Banani, Dhaka, Bangladesh. shameemaferdous@gmail.com.', 'ASHIC Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh. dr.shahink10@gmail.com.', 'Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. himu33bd@gmail.com.', 'National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. sabinabd72@yahoo.com.', 'ASHIC Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh. salma.choudhury@shebanet.net.', 'School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. a.khan2@uq.edu.au.', 'ASHIC Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh. zohorajameela@gmail.com.', 'Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. zohorajameela@gmail.com.', 'Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC University Medical Centre, P.O.

METHODS: A case of pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH) during dasatinib therapy was retrospectively analyzed and the related literature was reviewed. RESULTS: A 55-year-old male with chronic myelogenous leukemia was treated with dasatinib at a dosage of 100 mg/d.After 36 months of initiating the therapy, he presented with chest distress, fatigue and general edema. His heart function was graded as NHYA . Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography documented right ventricle enlargement, right ventricular wall thickening, reduction of right ventricular systolic function, widening of the main pulmonary artery and branches , and an estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure(SPAP) of 115 mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), with pericardial effusion and normal systolic left ventricular function.Chest ultrasound documented bilateral pleural effusion.The patient had taken and withdrew dasatinib 5 times by himself.The symptom had improved after stopping the drug, with SPAP decreasing to 37-82 mmHg measured by echocardiography at the first 3 times, and the pleural effusion and the pericardial effusion had disappeared. But 1 year after the 4(th) withdrawal of the drug, his pulmonary arterial pressure had failed to decrease, and he had taken the drug again by himself. Other causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension such as lung parenchymal diseases, pulmonary thromboembolism, connective tissue diseases, other drug induced PAH, were excluded by extensive examinations. The patient refused to receive right-sided heart catheterization. The patient was followed until now. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib can cause partially reversible PAH. But after repeated use of the drug, PAH may become irreversible. Monitoring SPAP by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography is necessary during dasatinib therapy.",,"['Jin, J', 'Xu, X M', 'Wang, C']","['Jin J', 'Xu XM', 'Wang C']","['National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,China,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,8712226,['RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)'],IM,"['Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac Catheterization', 'Dasatinib/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Echocardiography', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Effusion', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,2016/02/18 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2016/02/17 06:00'],"['2016/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2016.02.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2016 Feb;39(2):83-7. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2016.02.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review recent literature on drug-related adverse effects, long-term medication adherence, limitations to fertility and pregnancy, effects on cognitive function, ability to work, financial toxicity, pediatric populations, and treatment discontinuation. While patients with CML are fortunate to have excellent therapies available to control their disease, many are unable to lead normal lives, which challenges the notion that research is no longer needed in CML.

ZFP809 binds to the primer-binding site (PBS)located downstream of the MoMLV-long terminal repeat (LTR) and induces epigenetic modifications at integration sites, such as repressive histone modifications and de novo DNA methylation. KRAB-ZFPs contain consensus TGEKP linkers between C2H2 zinc fingers. The phosphorylation of threonine residues within linkers leads to the inactivation of zinc finger binding to target sequences. ZFP809 also contains consensus linkers between zinc fingers. However, the function of ZFP809 linkers remains unknown. In the present study, we constructed ZFP809 proteins containing mutated linkers and examined their ability to silence transgene expression driven by MLV, binding ability to MLV PBS, and cellular localization. The results of the present study revealed that the linkers affected the ability of ZFP809 to silence transgene expression.

In this study, we reported the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel camptothecin derivative called compound 2-47. The changes in structure did not reduce its activity to inhibit DNA topoisomerase I. Compound 2-47 induced apoptosis of many tumor cells including leukemia cells K562, Jurkat, HL-60, breast cancer cell BT-549, colon cancer cell HT-29 and liver cancer cell HepG2 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2- to 3-fold lower than HCPT as a control. In particular, 2-47 inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells with an IC50 of as low as 40 nM. By making use of Jurkat cell as a model, following treatment of Jurkat cells, compound 2-47 activated caspase-3 and PARP, resulting in a decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These data showed that compound 2-47 induces Jurkat cell death through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In addition, compound 2-47 showed a decreased cytotoxic activity against normal cells and an improved solubility in low-polar solvent. For example, compound 2-47 solutes in CHCl3 130-fold higher than HCPT.

Their protective function is to help the cell cope with lethal conditions. The HSPs are a class of proteins which, in normal cells, are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, interacting with diverse protein substrates to assist in their folding, and preventing the appearance of folding intermediates that lead to misfolded or damaged molecules. They have been shown to interact with different key apoptotic proteins and play a crucial role in regulating apoptosis. Several HSPs have been demonstrated to directly interact with various components of tightly regulated caspase-dependent programmed cell death. These proteins also affect caspase-independent apoptosis by interacting with apoptogenic factors. Heat shock proteins are aberrantly expressed in hematological malignancies. Because of their prognostic implications and functional role in leukemias, HSPs represent an interesting target for antileukemic therapy.

In 270 children enrolled in clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Guatemala, Singapore and Japan, we identified four NUDT15 coding variants (p.Arg139Cys, p.Arg139His, p.Val18Ile and p.Val18_Val19insGlyVal) that resulted in 74.4-100% loss of nucleotide diphosphatase activity.

However, the beneficial graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect mediated by the conventional T cells contained within the allograft is often hampered by the concurrent occurrence of graft versus host disease (GvHD). Thus, developing strategies that can dissociate GvHD from GvL remain clinically challenging. Several preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that iNKTs significantly attenuate GvHD without abrogating the GvL effect. Besides preserving the GvL activity of the donor graft, iNKTs themselves exert antitumor immune responses via direct and indirect mechanisms. Herein, we review the various mechanisms by which iNKTs provide antitumor immunity and discuss their roles in GvHD suppression. We also highlight the opportunities and obstacles in manipulating iNKTs for use in the cellular therapy of hematologic malignancies.",,"['Guan, P', 'Bassiri, H', 'Patel, N P', 'Nichols, K E', 'Das, R']","['Guan P', 'Bassiri H', 'Patel NP', 'Nichols KE', 'Das R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Physiology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160215,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', '*Transplantation Immunology']",,,,2016/02/16 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2016/02/16 06:00'],"['2015/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2015335 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.335 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2016 May;51(5):629-37. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2015.335.

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",,"['Loayza-Puch, Fabricio', 'Rooijers, Koos', 'Buil, Levi C M', 'Zijlstra, Jelle', 'Oude Vrielink, Joachim F', 'Lopes, Rui', 'Ugalde, Alejandro Pineiro', 'van Breugel, Pieter', 'Hofland, Ingrid', 'Wesseling, Jelle', 'van Tellingen, Olaf', 'Bex, Axel', 'Agami, Reuven']","['Loayza-Puch F', 'Rooijers K', 'Buil LC', 'Zijlstra J', 'Oude Vrielink JF', 'Lopes R', 'Ugalde AP', 'van Breugel P', 'Hofland I', 'Wesseling J', 'van Tellingen O', 'Bex A', 'Agami R']","['Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Bio-Pharmacology/ Mouse Cancer Clinic, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Core Facility Molecular Pathology and Biobanking, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Bio-Pharmacology/ Mouse Cancer Clinic, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Urology The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Wytemaweg 80, 3015 CN Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160215,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Codon)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 1.5.1.- (Pyrroline Carboxylate Reductases)', 'EC 1.5.1.2 (delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/metabolism', 'Asparagine/genetics/metabolism', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Codon/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proline/biosynthesis/deficiency/*metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrroline Carboxylate Reductases/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism']",,,,2016/02/16 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2016/02/16 06:00'],"['2015/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nature16982 [pii]', '10.1038/nature16982 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2016 Feb 25;530(7591):490-4. doi: 10.1038/nature16982.

Although discrepancies in proliferative, self-renewal, and differentiation properties of normal LTHSCs are being increasingly recognized, the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity of leukemic LTHSCs are poorly understood. Using a CML mouse model, we identified gene expression differences between leukemic and nonleukemic LTHSCs. Expression of the thrombopoietin (THPO) receptor MPL was elevated in leukemic LTHSC populations. Compared with LTHSCs with low MPL expression, LTHSCs with high MPL expression showed enhanced JAK/STAT signaling and proliferation in response to THPO in vitro and increased leukemogenic capacity in vivo. Although both G0 and S phase subpopulations were increased in LTHSCs with high MPL expression, LSC capacity was restricted to quiescent cells. Inhibition of MPL expression in CML LTHSCs reduced THPO-induced JAK/STAT signaling and leukemogenic potential. These same phenotypes were also present in LTHSCs from patients with CML, and patient LTHSCs with high MPL expression had reduced sensitivity to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment but increased sensitivity to JAK inhibitors.

Hematological malignancies are characterized by genomic instability that is possibly related to underlying defects in DNA repair of genomic stability maintenance. METHODS: We have investigated the expression of RECQ helicases in different hematological malignancies and in their normal counterparts using publicly available gene expression data. Furthermore, we explored whether RECQ helicases expression could be associated with tumor progression and prognosis. RESULTS: Expression of at least one RECQ helicase family member was found significantly deregulated in all hematological malignancies investigated when compared to their normal counterparts. In addition, RECQ helicase expression was associated with a prognostic value in acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. CONCLUSION: RECQ helicase expression is deregulated in hematological malignancies compared to their normal counterparts in association with a prognostic value.

The PRH protein forms oligomeric complexes that bind to tandemly repeated PRH recognition sequences within or at a distance from PRH-target genes and recruit a variety of PRH-interacting proteins. PRH can also bind to other transcription factors and co-regulate specific target genes either directly through DNA binding, or indirectly through effects on the activity of its partner proteins. In addition, like some other homeodomain proteins, PRH can regulate the translation of specific mRNAs. Altered PRH expression and altered PRH intracellular localisation, are associated with breast cancer, liver cancer and thyroid cancer and some subtypes of leukaemia. This is consistent with the involvement of multiple PRH-interacting proteins, including the oncoprotein c-Myc, translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and the promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML), in the control of cell proliferation and cell survival. Similarly, multiple PRH target genes, including the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors, Endoglin, and Goosecoid, are known to be important in the control of cell proliferation and cell survival and/or the regulation of cell migration and invasion. In this review, we summarise the evidence that implicates PRH in tumourigenesis and we review the data that suggests PRH levels could be useful in cancer prognosis and in the choice of treatment options.",,"['Gaston, Kevin', 'Tsitsilianos, Maria-Angela', 'Wadey, Kerry', 'Jayaraman, Padma-Sheela']","['Gaston K', 'Tsitsilianos MA', 'Wadey K', 'Jayaraman PS']","['School of Biochemistry, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD UK.', 'School of Biochemistry, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD UK.', 'School of Biochemistry, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD UK.', 'Division of Immunity and Infection, School of Medicine, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160213,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,PMC4752775,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell invasion', 'Cell migration', 'Cell proliferation', 'HHEX', 'PRH', 'Tumourigenesis']",2016/02/16 06:00,2016/02/16 06:01,['2016/02/16 06:00'],"['2015/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-016-0077-7 [doi]', '77 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2016 Feb 13;6:12. doi: 10.1186/s13578-016-0077-7. eCollection 2016.,,"['FS/10/58/28515/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'MR/N012615/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7349-5513'],,,,,,,,

Most of these syndromes are primarily characterized by their non-malignant phenotype, whereas ALL may be the dominating or even only striking manifestation of the syndrome in some families. Identification of such ALL patients is important in order to adjust therapy and offer genetic counseling and cancer surveillance to mutation carriers in the family. In the coming years large genomic screening projects are expected to reveal further hitherto unrecognised familial ALL syndromes. The treatment of ALL cases harboring cancer predisposing mutations can be challenging for both the physician and the patient due to their preexisting symptoms, their reduced tolerance to radio- and/or chemotherapy with enhanced risk of life-threatening organ toxicities, and the paucity of data from ALL patients with the same or similar syndromes being treated by contemporary protocols. Recent studies clearly indicate that many of these patients stand a good chance of cure, and that they should be offered chemotherapy with the intention to cure. Some of these syndromes are characterized by reduced tolerance to radiotherapy and/or specific anticancer agents, while others are not.

Real-time PCR and western blotting indicated that Mcl-1 transcript and protein expression are upregulated during infection with virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Xinjiang strains but not with attenuated M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra or Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Mcl-1 transcript and protein expression were downregulated by specific inhibitors of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (AG490, PD98059 and LY294002, respectively). The strongest inhibitor of Mcl-1 expression was PD98059, the MAPK inhibitor. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the rate of apoptosis in peritoneal macrophages is significantly higher in mice infected with M. tuberculosis and the rate of apoptosis is correlated with the virulence of the strain of M. tuberculosis. Apoptosis was found to be upregulated by AG490, PD98059 and LY294002, whereas inhibition of the MAPK pathway sensitized the infected macrophages to apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that specific downregulation of Mcl-1 significantly increases apoptosis of peritoneal macrophages and that the MAPK signaling pathway is the primary mediator of Mcl-1 expression.","['(c) 2016 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Wang, Fei-Yu', 'Wang, Xin-Min', 'Wang, Chan', 'Wang, Xiao-Fang', 'Zhang, Yu-Qing', 'Wu, Jiang-Dong', 'Wu, Fang', 'Zhang, Wan-Jiang', 'Zhang, Le']","['Wang FY', 'Wang XM', 'Wang C', 'Wang XF', 'Zhang YQ', 'Wu JD', 'Wu F', 'Zhang WJ', 'Zhang L']","['Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Urinary Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases in cooperation with the Education Ministry of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang, Shihezi, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*drug effects/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*isolation & purification', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tuberculosis/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tyrphostins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'apoptosis', 'signaling pathway inhibitors']",2016/02/16 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/02/16 06:00'],"['2015/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/1348-0421.12368 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2016 Apr;60(4):215-27. doi: 10.1111/1348-0421.12368.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isoflavones and their metabolites can affect endogenous estradiol production, action, and metabolism, potentially influencing ovarian follicle function. However, no studies have examined the effects of equol on intact ovarian antral follicles, which are responsible for sex steroid synthesis and further development into ovulatory follicles. Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that equol inhibits antral follicle growth, increases follicle atresia, and inhibits steroidogenesis in the adult mouse ovary. To test this hypothesis, antral follicles isolated from adult CD-1 mice were cultured with vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO) or equol (600 nM, 6 muM, 36 muM, and 100 muM) for 48 and 96 h. Every 24h, follicle diameters were measured to monitor growth. At 48 and 96 h, the culture medium was subjected to measurement of hormone levels, and the cultured follicles were subjected to gene expression analysis. Additionally, follicles were histologically evaluated for signs of atresia after 96 h of culture. The results indicate that equol (100 muM) inhibited follicle growth, altered the mRNA levels of bcl2-associated X protein and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, and induced follicle atresia. Further, equol decreased the levels of estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone, and it decreased mRNA levels of cholesterol side-chain cleavage, steroid 17-alpha-hydroxalase, and aromatase. Collectively, these data indicate that equol inhibits growth, increases atresia, and inhibits steroidogenesis of cultured mouse antral follicles.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report on the cooperative effect of Tet2 inactivation and DNMT3A mutation affecting arginine 882 (DNMT3A(R882H)) using a murine bone marrow transplantation assay. Five out of eighteen primary recipients developed hematological malignancies with one mouse developing an AITL-like disease, two mice presenting acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-like and two others T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)-like diseases within 6 months following transplantation. Serial transplantations of DNMT3A(R882H) Tet2(-/-) progenitors led to a differentiation bias toward the T-cell compartment, eventually leading to AITL-like disease in 9/12 serially transplanted recipients. Expression profiling suggested that DNMT3A(R882H) Tet2(-/-) T-ALLs resemble those of NOTCH1 mutant. Methylation analysis of DNMT3A(R882H) Tet2(-/-) T-ALLs showed a global increase in DNA methylation affecting tumor suppressor genes and local hypomethylation affecting genes involved in the Notch pathway.

Here we utilized a well-characterized zebrafish model of Myc-induced T-ALL for genetic studies to identify novel genes contributing to disease onset. We found that heterozygous inactivation of a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (Dlst), significantly delayed tumor onset in zebrafish without detectable effects on fish development. DLST is the E2 transferase of the alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC), which converts alpha-KG to succinyl-CoA in the TCA cycle. RNAi knockdown of DLST led to decreased cell viability and induction of apoptosis in human T-ALL cell lines. Polar metabolomics profiling revealed that the TCA cycle was disrupted by DLST knockdown in human T-ALL cells, as demonstrated by an accumulation of alpha-KG and a decrease of succinyl-CoA. Addition of succinate, the downstream TCA cycle intermediate, to human T-ALL cells was sufficient to rescue defects in cell viability caused by DLST inactivation. Together, our studies uncovered an important role for DLST in MYC-mediated leukemogenesis and demonstrated the metabolic dependence of T-lymphoblasts on the TCA cycle, thus providing implications for targeted therapy.",,"['Anderson, N M', 'Li, D', 'Peng, H L', 'Laroche, F J F', 'Mansour, M R', 'Gjini, E', 'Aioub, M', 'Helman, D J', 'Roderick, J E', 'Cheng, T', 'Harrold, I', 'Samaha, Y', 'Meng, L', 'Amsterdam, A', 'Neuberg, D S', 'Denton, T T', 'Sanda, T', 'Kelliher, M A', 'Singh, A', 'Look, A T', 'Feng, H']","['Anderson NM', 'Li D', 'Peng HL', 'Laroche FJ', 'Mansour MR', 'Gjini E', 'Aioub M', 'Helman DJ', 'Roderick JE', 'Cheng T', 'Harrold I', 'Samaha Y', 'Meng L', 'Amsterdam A', 'Neuberg DS', 'Denton TT', 'Sanda T', 'Kelliher MA', 'Singh A', 'Look AT', 'Feng H']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Institute of Molecular Hematology, Second Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'David H Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Washington State University, College of Pharmacy, Spokane, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, The Center for Cancer Research, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160215,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Acyl Coenzyme A)', '0 (Ketoglutaric Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'BSI27HW5EQ (succinyl-coenzyme A)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.61 (dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acyl Coenzyme A/metabolism', 'Acyltransferases/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', '*Citric Acid Cycle', 'Humans', 'Ketoglutaric Acids/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish']",PMC4889531,,,2016/02/16 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/02/16 06:00'],"['2015/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201626 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.26 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Jun;30(6):1365-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.26.

Recognition of tumors by NK cells occurred via natural cytotoxicity receptors and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. Some ligands of the activating receptors seem to be present on malignant cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of activating receptors such as NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp30, and NKp46, and inhibitory receptors such as NKG2A, CD158b, CD158a, and CD158e1 on NK cells from patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia before and after stimulation with IL-2 and IL-12. METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 AML M3, and group 2 non-M3 AML. Flow cytometry was performed on whole PBMC to evaluate NK cell receptors. RESULTS: Twenty one AML patients, aged 26-78 years, and 11 matched healthy individuals were studied. NKG2D, and NKp46 expression was decreased in group 1 (p <0.019). Patients in Group 2 showed underexpression of the activating receptors NKp46. Differences after stimulation of NK cells with IL-2 and IL-12 were observed only in Group 2, in which a significant decrease in the expression of NKp46 receptor was found (p <0.0016). Patients in groups 1 and 2 showed overexpression of the inhibitory receptors CD158b (p <0.007) and NKG2A (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: NKG2D receptor expression is decreased in patients with AML M3. In addition, patients with all FAB types of AML have overexpression of inhibitory receptors such as CD158b and NKG2A and decreased expression of the activating receptor NKp46.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Sandoval-Borrego, Daniela', 'Moreno-Lafont, Martha C', 'Vazquez-Sanchez, Ernesto Antonio', 'Gutierrez-Hoya, Adriana', 'Lopez-Santiago, Ruben', 'Montiel-Cervantes, Laura A', 'Ramirez-Saldana, Maricela', 'Vela-Ojeda, Jorge']","['Sandoval-Borrego D', 'Moreno-Lafont MC', 'Vazquez-Sanchez EA', 'Gutierrez-Hoya A', 'Lopez-Santiago R', 'Montiel-Cervantes LA', 'Ramirez-Saldana M', 'Vela-Ojeda J']","['Departamento de Inmunologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Inmunologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Inmunologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Catedra CONACYT, Facultad de Estudios Superiores Zaragoza, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Inmunologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico; Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Inmunologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico; Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.

Case report].,310-5,10.1556/650.2016.30381 [doi],"Graves' orbitopathy is the extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease, which is the most common cause of exophthalmos. As eye symptoms usually coincide with the development of thyrotoxicosis, the diagnosis of the disease is rarely difficult.

METHODS: The hairpin- like oligonucleotide sequences targeting LSD1 gene was transfected into Jurkat cells by lipofectamine(TM) 2000. The LSD1 mRNA and protein were detected by RQ- PCR and Western blot. Cell growth was determined by MTT. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, procaspase- 3, and histone H3K4me, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, Act- H3, H3K9me were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: LSD1 mRNA was markedly suppressed by the shRNA targeting LSD1. LSD1 shRNA suppressed the proliferation and induced cells apoptosis of Jurkat cells. The cell apoptotic rate was (41.34+/-3.58)%, (3.45+/-1.54)%, (1.76+/-0.52)% in LSD1 shRNA, Neg-shRNA and Blank respectively, the difference among them was statistically significant (P<0.05).

METHOD: Killer cell KIR genotyping was performed on 468 individuals from 156 unrelated families by PCR-SSP. A total of 624 KIR haplotypes from the parents were used for haplotype analysis. Ninety-two patients received haplo-identical HSCT from one of the parents. RESULTS: The family study showed segregation of one A haplotype and at least 20 unique B haplotypes. The frequency of haplotype A was 72.92% (455/624). The most commonly observed haplotypes in group B were B1, B2, and B3, present at a frequency of 10.26%, 5.77%, and 4.48%, respectively.

METHODS: 122 CML patients received dasatinib treatment, including 83 with imatinib-resistance and 39 with both imatinib- and nilotinib-resistance, 55 in the chronic-phase (CP), 21 in the accelerated- phase (AP)and 46 in the blast- phase (BP). Those harboring dasatinib highly- resistant mutations (T315I/A, F317L/V/C and V299L)were excluded based on BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation screening by Sanger sequencing at baseline. Hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses were evaluated regularly, and rates of progression-free-survival (PFS)and overall survival (OS)were analyzed. BCR- ABL mutation detection was performed once the patients failed on dasatinib. RESULTS: In the CP patients, the rates of complete hematological response (CHR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR)and molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5)were 92.7%, 53.7%, 29.6% and 14.8%, respectively. 4-year PFS and OS rates were 84.4% and 89.5%, respectively. In the AP patients, HR and CCyR rates were 81.0% and 35.0%; and 3-year PFS and OS rates were 56.1% and 59.3%, respectively. In the BP patients, HR and CCyR rates were 63.0% and 21.4%; and 1-year PFS and OS rates were 43.6% and 61.8%, respectively. Outcomes were similar when dasatinib was used as the second- line TKI or the third-line TKI. Of the 75 patients who were resistant to dasatinib, 37 (48.7%)developed new mutation(s), and T315I (59.5%)was the most common mutation type. The patients who already harbored mutation(s)before dasatinib therapy achieved similar responses and outcomes to those with no mutation at baseline. However, they had higher likelihood of developing additional mutations associated with resistance to dasatinib (65.7%vs 34.1%,P=0.006).

Increasing evidence reveals that Notch pathway has an important role in the invasion ability of tumor cells, including leukemia, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain mostly unclear. Here, we show that Notch3 is a novel target protein of the prolyl-isomerase Pin1, which is able to regulate Notch3 protein processing and to stabilize the cleaved product, leading to the increased expression of the intracellular domain (N3IC), finally enhancing Notch3-dependent invasiveness properties. We demonstrate that the combined inhibition of Notch3 and Pin1 in the Notch3-overexpressing human leukemic TALL-1 cells reduces their high invasive potential, by decreasing the expression of the matrix metalloprotease MMP9. Consistently, Pin1 depletion in a mouse model of Notch3-induced T-ALL, by reducing N3IC expression and signaling, impairs the expansion/invasiveness of CD4(+)CD8(+) DP cells in peripheral lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. Notably, in in silico gene expression analysis of human T-ALL samples we observed a significant correlation between Pin1 and Notch3 expression levels, which may further suggest a key role of the newly identified Notch3-Pin1 axis in T-ALL aggressiveness and progression. Thus, combined suppression of Pin1 and Notch3 proteins may be exploited as an additional target therapy for T-ALL.",,"['Franciosa, G', 'Diluvio, G', 'Gaudio, F Del', 'Giuli, M V', 'Palermo, R', 'Grazioli, P', 'Campese, A F', 'Talora, C', 'Bellavia, D', ""D'Amati, G"", 'Besharat, Z M', 'Nicoletti, C', 'Siebel, C W', 'Choy, L', 'Rustighi, A', 'Sal, G Del', 'Screpanti, I', 'Checquolo, S']","['Franciosa G', 'Diluvio G', 'Gaudio FD', 'Giuli MV', 'Palermo R', 'Grazioli P', 'Campese AF', 'Talora C', 'Bellavia D', ""D'Amati G"", 'Besharat ZM', 'Nicoletti C', 'Siebel CW', 'Choy L', 'Rustighi A', 'Sal GD', 'Screpanti I', 'Checquolo S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Radiological, Oncological and Pathological Sciences, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Histology and Medical Embryology, Department of Anatomy, Histology, Forensic Medicine and Orthopaedics, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Discovery Oncology, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Discovery Oncology, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Laboratorio Nazionale CIB Area Science Park Trieste, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Laboratorio Nazionale CIB Area Science Park Trieste, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute Pasteur-Foundation Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnology, Sapienza University, Latina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160215,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', '*Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC5024153,,,2016/02/16 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2016/02/16 06:00'],"['2015/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['onc20165 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.5 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Sep 8;35(36):4741-51. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.5.

Transcriptomic analyses show that monocytes/macrophages and leukemic cells cross talk during CLL progression. Macrophage depletion impairs CLL engraftment, drastically reduces leukemic growth, and favorably impacts mouse survival. Targeting of macrophages by either CSF1R signaling blockade or clodrolip-mediated cell killing has marked inhibitory effects on established leukemia also. Macrophage killing induces leukemic cell death mainly via the TNF pathway and reprograms the tumor microenvironment toward an antitumoral phenotype. CSF1R inhibition reduces leukemic cell load, especially in the bone marrow, and increases circulating CD20(+) leukemic cells. Accordingly, co-targeting TAMs and CD20-expressing leukemic cells provides a survival benefit in the mice. These results establish the important role of macrophages in CLL and suggest therapeutic strategies based on interfering with leukemia-macrophage interactions.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

MATERIAL/METHODS: The study involved a group of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and healthy volunteer blood donors. The presence of chosen proteins and their natural regulators was confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed a decreased expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 in the leukocytes of B-CLL patients. Decreased expression of sIL-6Ralpha has been observed in lymphocytes, with a simultaneous increase of expression in PMNs. Lower expression of sgp-130 was found in B cells while its expression was elevated in the neutrophils of patients in early stages of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The changes observed in the expression of IL-1 and IL-6 seem to exclude their immediate involvement in the progress of B-CLL. However, the presented changes in the expression of proteins regulating IL-1beta and IL-6 in PMNs indicate a potential role of early immune response cells also in advanced stages of the disease.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Medical University of Bialystok.

Virtual reality exercise can be performed even in a biological clean room and it may improve the adherence rates in elderly patients with hematologic malignancies. Thus, in this pilot study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of virtual reality exercise intervention using Nintendo Wii Fit in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: In this feasibility study, 16 hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies aged >/=60 years performed virtual reality exercise for 20 minutes using the Nintendo Wii Fit once a day, five times a week, from the start of chemotherapy until hospital discharge. The adherence rate, safety, and physical and psychological performances were assessed. RESULTS: The adherence rate for all 16 patients was 66.5%. Nine patients completed the virtual reality exercise intervention with 88 sessions, and the adherence rate was 62.0%.

METHODS: A total of 61 patients diagnosed as hematological malignancies undergoing haplo-HSCT were analyzed retrospectively in our center. RESULTS: In the cohort, 36 patients had CMV reactivation after haplo-HSCT. The 100-day cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation was 59%. Compared with that in patients without CMV reactivation after transplantation, the incidence of leukemia relapse was lower in patients with CMV reactivation (16.9% vs 40.0%, P=0.034). The correlation of CMV reactivation and decreased relapse rate was only found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (P=0.019). In multivariate analysis, relapsed disease status before transplant was a significant negative predictor of overall survival (OS) and relapse after transplant (RR was 2.866 and 3.331 respectively). CMV reactivation after transplant had a protective effect on disease relapse (RR=0.300, P=0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of CMV reactivation after haplo-HSCT is high.

Here, we investigated the prevalence of autoimmune diseases among MDS patients, comparing characteristics and outcomes in those with and without autoimmune diseases. From our study group of 1408 MDS patients, 391 (28%) had autoimmune disease, with hypothyroidism being the most common type, accounting for 44% (n = 171) of patients (12% among all MDS patients analyzed).

He achieved complete remission after chemotherapy and subsequently, autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) was performed. Fifteen months after the auto-PBSCT, abnormal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood gradually increased.

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 12 months of neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. METHODS: We did this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 495 centres in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and North and South America. Eligible women (aged >/=18 years, or >/=20 years in Japan) had stage 1-3 HER2-positive breast cancer and had completed neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy up to 2 years before randomisation. Inclusion criteria were amended on Feb 25, 2010, to include patients with stage 2-3 HER2-positive breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab therapy up to 1 year previously. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral neratinib 240 mg per day or matching placebo. The randomisation sequence was generated with permuted blocks stratified by hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive [oestrogen or progesterone receptor-positive or both] vs hormone receptor-negative [oestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative]), nodal status (0, 1-3, or >/=4), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (sequentially vs concurrently with chemotherapy), then implemented centrally via an interactive voice and web-response system. Patients, investigators, and trial sponsors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival, as defined in the original protocol, at 2 years after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00878709. FINDINGS: Between July 9, 2009, and Oct 24, 2011, we randomly assigned 2840 women to receive neratinib (n=1420) or placebo (n=1420). Median follow-up time was 24 months (IQR 20-25) in the neratinib group and 24 months (22-25) in the placebo group. At 2 year follow-up, 70 invasive disease-free survival events had occurred in patients in the neratinib group versus 109 events in those in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.0091). The 2-year invasive disease-free survival rate was 93.9% (95% CI 92.4-95.2) in the neratinib group and 91.6% (90.0-93.0) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in patients in the neratinib group were diarrhoea (grade 3, n=561 [40%] and grade 4, n=1 [<1%] vs grade 3, n=23 [2%] in the placebo group), vomiting (grade 3, n=47 [3%] vs n=5 [<1%]), and nausea (grade 3, n=26 [2%] vs n=2 [<1%]). QT prolongation occurred in 49 (3%) patients given neratinib and 93 (7%) patients given placebo, and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (>/=grade 2) in 19 (1%) and 15 (1%) patients, respectively. We recorded serious adverse events in 103 (7%) patients in the neratinib group and 85 (6%) patients in the placebo group. Seven (<1%) deaths (four patients in the neratinib group and three patients in the placebo group) unrelated to disease progression occurred after study drug discontinuation. The causes of death in the neratinib group were unknown (n=2), a second primary brain tumour (n=1), and acute myeloid leukaemia (n=1), and in the placebo group were a brain haemorrhage (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and gastric cancer (n=1). None of the deaths were attributed to study treatment in either group. INTERPRETATION: Neratinib for 12 months significantly improved 2-year invasive disease-free survival when given after chemotherapy and trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy to women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to ensure that the improvement in breast cancer outcome is maintained. FUNDING: Wyeth, Pfizer, Puma Biotechnology.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, resistance to imatinib has been observed, and a substantial number of patients need alternative treatment strategies. METHODS: We have evaluated the effects of deferasirox, an orally active iron chelator, and imatinib on K562 and KU812 human CML cell lines. Imatinib-resistant CML cell lines were created by exposing cells to gradually increasing concentrations of imatinib. RESULTS: Co-treatment of cells with deferasirox and imatinib induced a synergistic dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of both CML cell lines. Cell cycle analysis showed an accumulation of cells in the subG1 phase. Western blot analysis of apoptotic proteins showed that co-treatment with deferasirox and imatinib induced an increased expression of apoptotic proteins. These tendencies were clearly identified in imatinib-resistant CML cell lines. The results also showed that co-treatment with deferasirox and imatinib reduced the expression of BcrAbl, phosphorylated Bcr-Abl, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and beta-catenin. CONCLUSIONS: We observed synergistic effects of deferasirox and imatinib on both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-sensitive cell lines. These effects were due to induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by down-regulated expression of NF-kappaB and beta-catenin levels. Based on these results, we suggest that a combination treatment of deferasirox and imatinib could be considered as an alternative treatment option for imatinib-resistant CML.",,"['Kim, Dae Sik', 'Na, Yoo Jin', 'Kang, Myoung Hee', 'Yoon, Soo-Young', 'Choi, Chul Won']","['Kim DS', 'Na YJ', 'Kang MH', 'Yoon SY', 'Choi CW']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Korea University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Korea University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Korea University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160215,Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Deferasirox', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']",PMC4773721,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Deferasirox', 'Imatinib', 'Iron chelator', 'Resistance']",2016/02/15 06:00,2017/01/18 06:00,['2016/02/15 06:00'],"['2015/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3904/kjim.2015.024 [doi]', 'kjim.2015.024 [pii]']",ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2016 Mar;31(2):357-66. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2015.024.

Abnormalities in the expression and function of cell adhesion molecules may account for the patterns of intra-nodal growth and hematogenous spread of the malignant cells. Chemokines and integrin-mediated adhesion and trans-endothelial migration (TEM) are central aspects in trafficking and retention of hematopoietic cells in the BM and lymphoid organs. AIM OF THE WORK: This work was conducted to study adhesion molecules status in CLL and its potential impact on both hematological and clinical parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 78 newly diagnosed CLL patients. Immunophenotyping was performed on peripheral blood using the chronic lymphoid panel. Adhesion molecules (CD11a, CD11b, CD49d, CD49C, CD29 and CD38) were tested using monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by Flow Cytometry. RESULTS: Positive correlation was encountered between adhesion molecules: CD38 with CD49d (r=0.25, p=0.028), CD11a with CD11b, CD49d and CD29 (r=0.394, p=0.001; r=0.441, p=<0.01 and r=0.446, p<0.01 respectively) and CD29 with CD49c and CD49d (r=0.437, p<0.01; r=0.674, p<0.01 respectively). CD49c showed negative correlation with Rai staging (r=-0.269, p=0.033). CD11a and CD29 showed a significant relation with splenomegaly (p=0.04 and 0.03 respectively) and CD49d showed a significant relation with lymphadenopathy (p=0.02). CONCLUSION: The level of different adhesion molecules expression in CLL is apparently reflected on the potential migratory behavior of the leukemic cells to different organs.","['Copyright (c) 2016 National Cancer Institute, Cairo University.

Surprisingly, our data from mRNA transcription profiling did not show any differences in the classical angiogenic pathways, but differences were observed in mitochondrial metabolic pathways, suggesting a key role for metabolic reprogramming. We then validated these results with mRNA profiling by investigating differential protein expression via immunohistochemistry in angiogenic and non-angiogenic non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for 35 angiogenesis- and hypoxia-related biomarkers were performed on a collection of 194 angiogenic and 73 non-angiogenic NSCLCs arranged on tissue microarrays. Sequencing of P53 was performed with frozen tissue samples of NSCLC. RESULTS: The non-angiogenic tumours were distinguished from the angiogenic ones by having higher levels of proteins associated with ephrin pathways, mitochondria, cell biogenesis, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) regulation by oxygen and transcription of HIF-controlled genes but lower levels of proteins involved in the stroma, cell-cell signaling and adhesion, integrins, and Delta-Notch and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related signaling. However, proteins classically associated with angiogenesis were present in both types of tumours at very comparable levels. Cytoplasmic expression of P53 was strongly associated with non-angiogenic tumours. A pilot investigation showed that P53 mutations were observed in 32.0% of angiogenic cases but in 71.4% of non-angiogenic tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations thus far indicate that both angiogenic and non-angiogenic tumours experience hypoxia/HIF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway protein expression in a comparable fashion. However, angiogenesis does not ensue in the non-angiogenic tumours. Surprisingly, metabolic reprogramming seems to distinguish these two types of neoplastic growth. On the basis of these results, we raise the hypothesis that in some, but not in all cases, initial tissue remodeling and/or inflammation could be one of the secondary steps necessary to trigger angiogenesis. In the non-angiogenic tumours, in which neovascularisation fails to occur, HIF pathway activation could be the driving force toward metabolic reprogramming.",,"['Adighibe, Omanma', 'Leek, Russell D', 'Fernandez-Mercado, Marta', 'Hu, Jiangting', 'Snell, Cameron', 'Gatter, Kevin C', 'Harris, Adrian L', 'Pezzella, Francesco']","['Adighibe O', 'Leek RD', 'Fernandez-Mercado M', 'Hu J', 'Snell C', 'Gatter KC', 'Harris AL', 'Pezzella F']","['Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Nuffield Division of Laboratory Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK. omanezi@gmail.com.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Nuffield Division of Laboratory Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK. russell.leek@oncology.ox.ac.uk.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Laboratory Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK. marfermer@yahoo.es.', 'Biodonostia Research Institute, Oncology Area, San Sebastian, Spain. marfermer@yahoo.es.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Nuffield Division of Laboratory Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK. jianting.hu@ndcls.ox.ac.uk.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Nuffield Division of Laboratory Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK. cameron.snell@gmail.com.', 'Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Nuffield Division of Laboratory Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK. kevin.gatter@ndcls.ox.ac.uk.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Molecular Oncology Laboratories, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK.

Most prominent are failures of DNA repair such as Fanconi Anemia and much rarer failure of ribosomal apparatus, e.g., Diamond Blackfan Anemia or of telomere elongation such as dyskeratosis congenita. In these congenital disorders, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is often a consideration. However, HSCT will not correct the underlying disease and possible co-existing extra-medullary (multi)-organ defects, but will improve BMF.

We report 25 children with CNS involvement of CD20+ B lymphoid malignancies who received in total 163 IT/intraventricular rituximab doses. The median number of doses received by each patient was 6, with a median dose of 25 mg. The most common adverse events were Grades 1 and 2 peripheral neuropathies in five patients (20%), allergy in two patients, and headache in two patients. These events were self-limited, occurring in the 48 hours after treatment and resolving within 24 hr.

Eighteen patients (72%) of those treated with IT/intraventricular rituximab, with or without other CNS directed treatment, achieved a CNS remission.

We report 15 EBF1-PDGFRB-positive patients from childhood ALL treatment trials (ALL 97/99, UKALL 2003, UKALL 2011) in the United Kingdom. The fusion arose from interstitial deletion of 5q33 (n = 11), balanced rearrangement (n = 2), or complex rearrangement (n = 2).

Among 12 patients who achieved complete remission on earlier trials (ALL 97/99 and UKALL 2003), 10 were positive for minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction, and 7 relapsed 18 to 59 months after diagnosis. The majority (9 of 12) remained alive 6 to 9 years after diagnosis.

A passive RFID microchip absorbs energy from an external source and emits a radiofrequency identification signal which is then decoded by a detector. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the radiofrequency energy emitted by a RFID microchip on human cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molt-4 leukemia, BT474 breast cancer, and HepG2 hepatic cancer cells were exposed in vitro to RFID microchip-emitted radiofrequency field for 1 h. Cells were counted before and after exposure. Effects of pretreatment with the spin-trap compound N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone or the iron-chelator deferoxamine were also investigated. Results We found that the energy effectively killed/retarded the growth of the three different types of cancer cells, and the effect was blocked by the spin-trap compound or the iron-chelator, whereas an inactive microchip and energy from the external source had no significant effect on the cells. Conclusions Data of the present study suggest that radiofrequency field from the microchip affects cancer cells via the Fenton Reaction.

Silencing the p50 and p65 NF-kappaB subunits in the NSCLC H1299 cell line led to profound loss in cell viability and downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and Mcl1. We also showed that a survivin suppressant, the dioxonaphthoimidazolium YM155, and its structural analog AB1 arrested the growth of H1299 cells at nanomolar concentrations. Both compounds were apoptogenic and suppressed survivin and other anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl) in a dose- and/or time-dependent manner. YM155 and AB1 did not affect the expression of key proteins (IkappaBalpha, p65, p50) involved in NF-kappaB signaling. Stable IkappaBalpha levels suggest that the NF-kappaB/IkappaB complex and proteins upstream of IkappaBalpha, were not targeted. Neither did the compounds intercept the nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits. On the other hand, YM155 and AB1 suppressed the phosphorylation of the p50 subunit at Ser337 which is critical in promoting the binding of NF-kappaB dimers to DNA. Both compounds duly impeded the binding of NF-kappaB dimers to DNA and attenuated transcriptional activity of luciferase-transfected HEK293 cells controlled by NF-kappaB response elements. We propose that the ""silencing"" the NF-kappaB pathway effected by these compounds contributed to their potent apoptogenic effects on H1299. Notwithstanding, the mechanism(s) involved in their ability to abolish phosphorylation of p50 remains to be elucidated. Taken together, these results disclose a novel facet of functionalized dioxonaphthoimidazoliums that could account for their potent cell killing property.",,"['Ho, Si Han Sherman', 'Ali, Azhar', 'Chin, Tan Min', 'Go, Mei Lin']","['Ho SH', 'Ali A', 'Chin TM', 'Go ML']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (YM 155)', '0', '(chlorambucil-N-(2-(4-(4-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl)butyryl)aminoethyl)-5-(4-a', 'midinophenyl)-2-furancarboxamide hydrochloride)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorambucil/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",PMC4905498,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB signaling', 'YM155', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'p50 phosphorylation', 'survivin suppressant']",2016/02/13 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2016/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['7299 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7299 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Mar 8;7(10):11625-36. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7299.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Guidewire catheter exchange (GCE) replaces a CVC without repeat venipuncture. This study evaluated the indications, success rate, and complications of GCE in a large cohort of pediatric cancer patients. PROCEDURE: Medical records of pediatric cancer patients who underwent GCE at our institution between 2003 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Variables analyzed included gender, age at GCE, primary cancer diagnosis, indication for GCE, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at GCE, vein used, success rate, and postoperative complications (<30 days after exchange). RESULTS: A total of 435 GCEs performed in 407 patients (230 males and 177 females) were reviewed. Median age at GCE was 8 years (range, 0.2-24). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the most common diagnosis (50.6%). The primary indication for GCE was the desire to have an alternative type of CVC (71%). Other indications included catheter displacement (17%), catheter malfunction (11%), and catheter infection (1%). Median ANC at GCE was 2,581/mm(3) (range, 0-43,400). Left subclavian vein was more commonly used (57.7%). The success rate of GCE was 93.4% (406 of 435 procedures, 95% confidence interval: 91.0-97.5%). A total of 33 (7.5%) postoperative complications occurred including central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) (n = 20, 4.5%), catheter dislodgement (n = 6, 1.4%), and catheter malfunction (n = 7, 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that GCE in pediatric cancer patients is associated with a high success rate and a low risk of complications. The most common postoperative complication, CLABSI, occurred at a rate significantly lower than following de novo CVC placement.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Fernandez-Pineda, I', 'Ortega-Laureano, L', 'Wu, H', 'Wu, J', 'Sandoval, J A', 'Rao, B N', 'Shochat, S J', 'Davidoff, A M']","['Fernandez-Pineda I', 'Ortega-Laureano L', 'Wu H', 'Wu J', 'Sandoval JA', 'Rao BN', 'Shochat SJ', 'Davidoff AM']","[""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160212,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Catheter-Related Infections/epidemiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods', 'Central Venous Catheters', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Pediatrics/methods', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['central venous catheter', 'guidewire catheter exchange', 'pediatric oncology']",2016/02/13 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25947 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jun;63(6):1081-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25947.

AIMS: To characterize the presence of additional DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) in children and adults with ALL by whole-genome oligonucleotide array (aCGH) analysis, and to identify their associations with clinical features and outcome. Array-CGH was carried out in 265 newly diagnosed ALLs (142 children and 123 adults). The NimbleGen CGH 12x135K array (Roche) was used to analyze genetic gains and losses. CNAs were analyzed with GISTIC and aCGHweb software. Clinical and biological variables were analyzed. Three of the patients showed chromothripsis (cth6, cth14q and cth15q). CNAs were associated with age, phenotype, genetic subtype and overall survival (OS). In the whole cohort of children, the losses on 14q32.33 (p = 0.019) and 15q13.2 (p = 0.04) were related to shorter OS. In the group of children without good- or poor-risk cytogenetics, the gain on 1p36.11 was a prognostic marker independently associated with shorter OS. In adults, the gains on 19q13.2 (p = 0.001) and Xp21.1 (p = 0.029), and the loss of 17p (p = 0.014) were independent markers of poor prognosis with respect to OS.

This study was aimed to study the etiology, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of psoriasis-associated APL and to map a suitable treatment regime for this condition. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 17 patients with psoriasis-associated APL diagnosed and treated in our hospital in the past decade. RESULTS: The 17 patients accounted for 8.3% of the total patients diagnosed with de novo APL during the same period in our hospital. Their clinical characteristics of APL were similar to those of general APL. Four patients had a definite history of taking bimolane. All patients received arsenic trioxide (ATO)-based remission induction and postremission treatment. After induction, 15 patients (88%) achieved hematologic complete remission. With a median follow-up of 27 months, the 3-year estimates of overall survival were 77.2% +/- 12.4% and the 3-year estimates of event-free survival were 70.6% +/- 13.5%. In addition, the ATO-based remission induction and postremission treatment significantly improved psoriasis symptoms in 83 and 85.7% of patients, respectively. Through the final follow-up, no chronic arsenicosis or secondary malignancy was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Psoriasis patients are at high risk for APL. The increased risk is most likely associated with the genetic background and bimolane treatment. The ATO-based therapy is especially suitable for patients with psoriasis-associated APL.

It left open however the question whether other genome-wide mutations may also commonly occur at high frequency in presentation HCLc disease. To address this, we have carried out WES of 5 such typical HCLc cases, using highly purified splenic tumour cells paired with autologous T cells for germline. Apart from BRAF V(600)E, no other recurrent somatic mutation was identified in these HCLc exomes, thereby excluding additional acquired mutations as also prevalent at a near-universal frequency in this form of the disease. These data then place mutant BRAF at the centre of the neoplastic drive in HCLc. A comparison of our exome data with emerging genetic findings in HCL indicates that additional somatic mutations may however occur recurrently in smaller subsets of disease. As mutant BRAF alone is insufficient to drive malignant transformation in other histological cancers, it suggests that individual tumours utilise largely differing patterns of genetic somatic mutations to coalesce with BRAF V(600)E to drive pathogenesis of malignant HCLc disease.",,"['Weston-Bell, Nicola J', 'Tapper, Will', 'Gibson, Jane', 'Bryant, Dean', 'Moreno, Yurany', 'John, Melford', 'Ennis, Sarah', 'Kluin-Nelemans, Hanneke C', 'Collins, Andrew R', 'Sahota, Surinder S']","['Weston-Bell NJ', 'Tapper W', 'Gibson J', 'Bryant D', 'Moreno Y', 'John M', 'Ennis S', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Collins AR', 'Sahota SS']","['Tumour Immunogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Genetic Epidemiology and Genomic Informatics Group, Human Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Biological Sciences, Faculty of Natural and Environmental Studies, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Tumour Immunogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Tumour Immunogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Preclinical Sciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of The West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Genetic Epidemiology and Genomic Informatics Group, Human Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Genetic Epidemiology and Genomic Informatics Group, Human Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Tumour Immunogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160212,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Exome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics', 'Spleen/metabolism/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology']",PMC4752330,,,2016/02/13 06:00,2016/07/22 06:00,['2016/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0149162 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-51152 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Feb 12;11(2):e0149162. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0149162. eCollection 2016.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is difficult to obtain a definite diagnosis and to initiate timely intervention. Mucorales-specific T cells occur during the course of IM and are involved in the clearance of the infection. We have evaluated the feasibility of detecting Mucorales-specific T cells in hematological patients at risk for IM, and have correlated the detection of such cells with the clinical conditions of the patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: By using an enzyme linked immunospot assay, the presence of Mucorales-specific T cells in peripheral blood (PB) samples has been investigated at three time points during high-dose chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. Mucorales-specific T cells producing interferon-gamma, interleukin-10 and interleukin-4 were analysed in order to detect a correlation between the immune response and the clinical picture. Twenty-one (10.3%) of 204 patients, accounting for 32 (5.3%) of 598 PB samples, tested positive for Mucorales-specific T cells. Two groups could be identified. Group 1, including 15 patients without signs or symptoms of invasive fungal diseases (IFD), showed a predominance of Mucorales-specific T cells producing interferon-gamma. Group 2 included 6 patients with a clinical picture consistent with invasive fungal disease (IFD): 2 cases of proven IM and 4 cases of possible IFD. The proven patients had significantly higher number of Mucorales-specific T cells producing interleukin-10 and interleukin-4 and higher rates of positive samples by using derived diagnostic cut-offs when compared with the 15 patients without IFD. CONCLUSIONS: Mucorales-specific T cells can be detected and monitored in patients with hematologic malignancies at risk for IM. Mucorales-specific T cells polarized to the production of T helper type 2 cytokines are associated with proven IM and may be evaluated as a surrogate diagnostic marker for IM.",,"['Potenza, Leonardo',

Overall response to HMA was not different based on TP53 mutation status (45% vs. 32% in TP53-mutated and wild type [WT], respectively, P = 0.13). However, response duration was significantly shorter in TP53-mutated patients compared to WT patients (5.7 months vs. 28.5 months, P = 0.003). Longitudinal analysis of TP53 mutations after HMA showed that TP53 mutations almost always persisted at times of disease progression. TP53-mutated patients showed significantly worse overall survival (OS) compared to WT patients (9.4 months vs. 20.7 months, P <0.001). Further, TP53 mutations distinguished prognosis in the subgroup of patients with complex karyotype and Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) defined very high-risk disease. Multivariate analysis showed that TP53 mutation status is significantly prognostic for OS after adjusting prognostic effect from other factors.

METHODOLOGY: Cytokines and transcription factors in haematopoiesis and leukaemic mechanisms are described. Genetic features and clinical implications due to the encoded chimeric neoproteins causing malignant haematopoietic disorders are reviewed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Multiple translocation partner genes are well known for leukaemia such as MYC, MLL, RARA, ALK, and RUNX1. With the advent of more sophisticated diagnostic tools and bioinformatics algorithms, an exponential growth in fusion genes discoveries is likely to increase.

METHODS: Ten patients were enrolled; eight had cytogenetic relapse and two had confirmed loss of major molecular response (MMR). At baseline, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation was detected in four patients. RESULTS: After 6 months of therapy, major cytogenetic response, complete cytogenetic response, and MMR were achieved in seven, four, and four patients, respectively. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia developed in one patient, and grade 1 skin rash in four. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results suggest that imatinib might have inhibitory effects on the clearance of nilotinib, increasing its efficacy.

While AML cells are highly sensitive to cytotoxic Ca2+ overload, the feasibility of Ca2+- targeted therapy of this disease remains unclear. Here, we show that apoptotic response of AML cells to the synergistically acting polyphenols curcumin (CUR) and carnosic acid (CA), combined at low, non-cytotoxic doses of each compound was mediated solely by disruption of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Specifically, activation of caspase cascade in CUR+CA-treated AML cells resulted from sustained elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ (Ca2+cyt) and was not preceded by endoplasmic reticulum stress or mitochondrial damage. The CUR+CA-induced Ca2+cyt rise did not involve excessive influx of extracellular Ca2+ but, rather, occurred due to massive Ca2+ release from intracellular stores concomitant with inhibition of Ca2+cyt extrusion through the plasma membrane. Notably, the CUR+CA combination did not alter Ca2+ homeostasis and viability in non-neoplastic hematopoietic cells, suggesting its cancer-selective action. Most importantly, co-administration of CUR and CA to AML-bearing mice markedly attenuated disease progression in two animal models. Collectively, our results provide the mechanistic and translational basis for further characterization of this combination as a prototype of novel Ca2+-targeted pharmacological tools for the treatment of AML.",,"['Pesakhov, Stella', 'Nachliely, Matan', 'Barvish, Zeev', 'Aqaqe, Nasma', 'Schwartzman, Bar', 'Voronov, Elena', 'Sharoni, Yoav', 'Studzinski, George P', 'Fishman, Daniel', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Pesakhov S', 'Nachliely M', 'Barvish Z', 'Aqaqe N', 'Schwartzman B', 'Voronov E', 'Sharoni Y', 'Studzinski GP', 'Fishman D', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'Permanent address: Blood Bank Institute, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer Sheva 85025, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'Permanent address: Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv 69978, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Abietanes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5077981,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'carnosic acid', 'curcumin', 'intracellular calcium']",2016/02/13 06:00,2017/12/27 06:00,['2016/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['7240 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7240 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 31;7(22):31847-61. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7240.,,['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,

Cells performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) through mitochondrial activity. To limit the deleterious effects of excess ROS, certain gene promoters contain antioxidant response elements (ARE), e.g. the genes NQO-1 and HO-1. ROS induces conformational changes in KEAP1 and releases NRF2, which activates AREs. We show in vitro and in vivo that OXPHOS induces, both in primary leukemic cells and cell lines, de novo expression of NQO-1 and HO-1 and also the MAPK ERK5 and decreases KEAP1 mRNA. ERK5 activates the transcription factor MEF2, which binds to the promoter of the miR-23a-27a-24-2 cluster. Newly generated miR-23a destabilizes KEAP1 mRNA by binding to its 3'UTR. Lower KEAP1 levels increase the basal expression of the NRF2-dependent genes NQO-1 and HO-1.

Standard laboratory studies revealed the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Massively parallel sequencing demonstrated no mutations in CSF3R, but the presence of a heterozygous NRAS-G12D variant (47% allele frequency). The patient was started on treatment with trametinib, an MEK1/2 inhibitor with Food and Drug Administration approval for malignant melanoma. Therapy with trametinib resulted in exceptional improvements in his blood counts and continued disease control with 14 months of follow-up.

TKI treatment was discontinued in 13 patients based on their requests. The BCR-ABL transcript levels were monitored in the peripheral blood by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis following treatment discontinuation. Of the 13 patients who discontinued TKI treatment, 7 remained in CMR, with a median follow-up of 26 months (range, 10-60 months).

However, the relapse rates are considerable, and relapse confers a poor outcome. Early assessment of the risk of relapse is therefore of paramount importance for the development of appropriate measures. We used the EuroChimerism approach to investigate the potential impact of lineage-specific chimerism testing for relapse-risk analysis in 162 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in a multicenter study based on standardized transplantation protocols. Within a median observation time of 4.5 years, relapses have occurred in 41/162 patients at a median of 0.6 years after transplantation (range, 0.13-5.7 years). Prospective screening at defined consecutive time points revealed that reappearance of recipient-derived cells within the CD34(+) and CD8(+) cell subsets display the most significant association with the occurrence of relapses with hazard ratios of 5.2 (P=0.003) and 2.8 (P=0.008), respectively. The appearance of recipient cells after a period of pure donor chimerism in the CD34(+) and CD8(+) leukocyte subsets revealed dynamics indicative of a significantly elevated risk of relapse or imminent disease recurrence. Assessment of chimerism within these lineages can therefore provide complementary information for further diagnostic and, potentially, therapeutic purposes aiming at the prevention of overt relapse.

However, a potential association with outcome has not yet been documented. The goal of this study was to evaluate effects of health care expenditure (HCE), Human Development Index (HDI), team density, and center experience on nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after HLA-matched sibling alloHCT for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 983 patients treated with myeloablative alloHCT between 2004 and 2008 in 24 European countries were included. RESULTS: In a univariate analysis, the probability of day 100 NRM was increased for countries with lower current HCE (8% vs. 3%; p = .06), countries with lower HDI (8% vs. 3%; p = .02), and centers with less experience (8% vs. 5%; p = .04). In addition, the overall NRM was increased for countries with lower current HCE (21% vs. 17%; p = .09) and HDI (21% vs. 16%; p = .03) and for centers with lower activity (21% vs. 16%; p = .07). In a multivariate analysis, the strongest predictive model for day 100 NRM included current HCE greater than the median (hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; p = .002). The overall NRM was mostly predicted by HDI greater than the median (HR, 0.65; p = .01). Both lower current HCE and HDI were associated with decreased probability of overall survival. CONCLUSION: Both macroeconomic factors and the socioeconomic status of a country strongly influence NRM after alloHCT for adults with ALL. Our findings should be considered when clinical studies in the field of alloHCT are interpreted.",['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],"['Giebel, Sebastian', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ibatici, Adalberto', 'Browne, Paul', 'Czerw, Tomasz', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Unal, Ali', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Potter, Mike', 'Furness, Caroline L', 'McQuaker, Grant', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Campos, Antonio', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Giebel S', 'Labopin M', 'Ibatici A', 'Browne P', 'Czerw T', 'Socie G', 'Unal A', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Goker H', 'Potter M', 'Furness CL', 'McQuaker G', 'Beelen D', 'Milpied N', 'Campos A', 'Craddock C', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland sgiebel@io.gliwice.pl.', 'Hospital Saint-Antoine, Asistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Acute Leukemia Working Party Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France INSERM Unites Mixtes de Recherche 938, Paris, France.', 'Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Genova, Italy.', ""St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."", 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'Erciyes Medical School, Kapadokya Bone Marrow Transplanatation Center, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Genova, Italy.', 'Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Trustee of London Clinic, London, United Kingdom.', 'Trustee of London Clinic, London, United Kingdom.', 'Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'University Hospital and University of Bordeaux, Pessac, France.', 'Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Acute Leukemia Working Party Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Hospital Saint-Antoine, Asistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Acute Leukemia Working Party Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France INSERM Unites Mixtes de Recherche 938, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160211,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Health Care Costs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*economics/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*economics/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4786353,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Health care expenditure', 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Human development index', 'Non-relapse mortality']",2016/02/13 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2016/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2015-0314 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0314 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2016 Mar;21(3):377-83. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0314.

Despite this, mechanisms of CNS infiltration are poorly understood, and the timing, frequency, and properties of BCP-ALL blasts entering the CNS compartment are unknown. We investigated the CNS-engrafting potential of BCP-ALL cells xenotransplanted into immunodeficient NOD.Cg- ITALIC! Prkdc (ITALIC! scid) ITALIC! Il2rg (ITALIC! tm1Wjl)/SzJ mice. CNS engraftment was seen in 23 of 29 diagnostic samples (79%): 2 of 2 from patients with overt CNS disease and 21 of 27 from patients thought to be CNS negative by diagnostic lumbar puncture. Histologic findings mimic human pathology and demonstrate that leukemic cells transit the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier situated close to the dural sinuses, the site of recently discovered CNS lymphatics. Retrieval of blasts from the CNS showed no evidence for chemokine receptor-mediated selective trafficking. The high frequency of infiltration and lack of selective trafficking led us to postulate that CNS tropism is a generic property of leukemic cells. To test this, we performed serial dilution experiments which showed CNS engraftment in 5 of 6 mice after transplant of as few as 10 leukemic cells. Clonal tracking techniques confirmed the polyclonal nature of CNS-infiltrating cells, with multiple clones engrafting in both the CNS and periphery. Overall, these findings suggest that subclinical seeding of the CNS is likely to be present in most BCP-ALL patients at original diagnosis, and efforts to prevent CNS relapse should concentrate on effective eradication of disease from this site rather than targeting entry mechanisms.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Williams, Mark T S', 'Yousafzai, Yasar M', 'Elder, Alex', 'Rehe, Klaus', 'Bomken, Simon', 'Frishman-Levy, Liron', 'Tavor, Sigal', 'Sinclair, Paul', 'Dormon, Katie', 'Masic, Dino', 'Perry, Tracey', 'Weston, Victoria J', 'Kearns, Pamela', 'Blair, Helen', 'Russell, Lisa J', 'Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Irving, Julie A E', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Vormoor, Josef', 'Graham, Gerard J', 'Halsey, Christina']","['Williams MT', 'Yousafzai YM', 'Elder A', 'Rehe K', 'Bomken S', 'Frishman-Levy L', 'Tavor S', 'Sinclair P', 'Dormon K', 'Masic D', 'Perry T', 'Weston VJ', 'Kearns P', 'Blair H', 'Russell LJ', 'Heidenreich O', 'Irving JA', 'Izraeli S', 'Vormoor J', 'Graham GJ', 'Halsey C']","['Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary, and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary, and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;

Tumor hypoxia is strongly associated with tumor propagation, malignant progression, and resistance to therapy. Aberrant epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in the process of hypoxia-driven malignant progression. Convert of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes plays important biological functions in embryonic stem cells, development, aging and disease. Recent reports showed that level of 5hmC and TET proteins was altered in various types of cancers. There is a strong correlation between loss of 5hmC and cancer development but research to date indicates that loss of TET activity is associated with the cancer phenotype but it is not clear whether TET proteins function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. While loss of TET1 and TET2 expression is associated with solid cancers, implying a tumor suppressor role, TET1 exhibits a clear oncogenic role in the context of genomic rearrangements such as in MLL-fusion rearranged leukemia. Interestingly, hypoxia increases global 5hmC levels and upregulates TET1 expression in a HIF1alpha-dependent manner. Recently, hypoxia-induced TET1 has been demonstrated to play another important role for regulating hypoxia-responsive gene expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by serving as a transcription co-activator. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced TET1 also regulates glucose metabolism and hypoxia-induced EMT through enhancing the expression of insulin induced gene 1 (INSIG1). The roles and mechanisms of action of 5hmC and TET proteins in ES cell biology and during embryonic development, as well as in cancer biology, will be the main focus in this review.",,"['Chen, Hsiao-Fan', 'Wu, Kou-Juey']","['Chen HF', 'Wu KJ']","['Research Center for Tumor Medical Science and Graduate Inst. of Cancer Biology, China Medical University, 404, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Research Center for Tumor Medical Science and Graduate Inst. of Cancer Biology, China Medical University, 404, Taichung, Taiwan. wukj@mail.cmu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160210,China (Republic : 1949- ),Biomedicine (Taipei),BioMedicine,101611451,,,,PMC4751095,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Epithelialmesenchymal Transition', 'Hypoxia', 'TET', 'Tumorigenesis']",2016/02/13 06:00,2016/02/13 06:01,['2016/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7603/s40681-016-0001-9 [doi]', '10.7603/s40681-016-0001-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomedicine (Taipei). 2016 Mar;6(1):1. doi: 10.7603/s40681-016-0001-9.

Little is known, however, regarding its regulation in hematological malignancies. We observed that PHLPP2 protein expression, but not its mRNA, was suppressed in late differentiation stage acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes. MicroRNAs (miR or miRNAs) from the miR-17-92 cluster, oncomir-1, were shown to inhibit PHLPP2 expression and these miRNAs were highly expressed in AML cells that lacked PHLPP2 protein. Studies showed that miR-17-92 cluster regulation was, surprisingly, independent of transcription factors c-MYC and E2F in these cells; instead all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a drug used for terminally differentiating AML subtypes, markedly suppressed miR-17-92 expression and increased PHLPP2 protein levels and phosphatase activity. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of ATRA on miR-17-92 expression is mediated through its target, transcription factor C/EBPbeta, which interacts with the intronic promoter of the miR-17-92 gene to inhibit transactivation of the cluster. These studies reveal a novel mechanism for upregulation of the phosphatase activity of PHLPP2 through C/EBPbeta-mediated repression of the miR-17-92 cluster in terminally differentiating myeloid cells.",,"['Yan, Y', 'Hanse, E A', 'Stedman, K', 'Benson, J M', 'Lowman, X H', 'Subramanian, S', 'Kelekar, A']","['Yan Y', 'Hanse EA', 'Stedman K', 'Benson JM', 'Lowman XH', 'Subramanian S', 'Kelekar A']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Biotechnology Program, Minneapolis Community and Technical College, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160212,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antagomirs)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PHLPP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Antagomirs/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'E2F Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC4946892,,,2016/02/13 06:00,2018/01/11 06:00,['2016/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd20161 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2016.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2016 Jul;23(7):1232-42. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2016.1.

However, there is no agreement on the need of plasma-posaconazole-concentration (PPC) monitoring as a routine practice in patients receiving PCZ-susp. In this prospective, multicenter study we evaluated the variability of PPCs in hematologic patients receiving PCZ-susp prophylaxis with the aim to define conditions at different risk of subtherapeutic PPCs. Overall, 103 acute leukemia (AL) patients submitted to intensive chemotherapy (115 courses) and 46 allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) recipients (47 courses) receiving PCZ-susp prophylaxis were considered. The adequacy of PPC pattern after the steady state (>/=day 7 of treatment) in courses with two or more PPC measurements was defined as follows: inadequate pattern: PPC < 0.5 mcg/ml at least once; borderline pattern: PPC always >/=0.5mcg/ml but < 0.7 mcg/ml at least once; adequate pattern: PPC always >/=0.7 mcg/ml. The PPC pattern was evaluable in 83 and 37 AL and allo-SCT patients, respectively. It was adequate, borderline and inadequate in 63.9%, 14.5%, and 21.7% of courses, respectively, in AL, and in 62.2%, 10.8%, and 27.0% of courses, respectively, in allo-SCT. In both groups, an inadequate PPC pattern was associated with the development of diarrhea. In absence of diarrhea, the probability of an inadequate PPC pattern was 11.9% in AL and 17.2% in allo-SCT patients. PCZ-susp might be used without stringent need of PPC monitoring in patients without diarrhea.","['(c) The Author 2016.

In this study, in 2,187 cases of European ancestry and 5,543 controls, we discover and replicate a locus indexed by rs77728904 at 9p21.3 associated with BCP-ALL susceptibility (Pcombined=3.32 x 10(-15), OR=1.72) and independent from rs3731217, the previously reported ALL-associated variant in this region. Of correlated SNPs tagged by this locus, only rs662463 is significant in African Americans, suggesting it is a plausible causative variant. Functional analysis shows that rs662463 is a cis-eQTL for CDKN2B, with the risk allele associated with lower expression, and suggests that rs662463 influences BCP-ALL risk by regulating CDKN2B expression through CEBPB signalling. Functional analysis of rs3731217 suggests it is associated with BCP-ALL by acting within a splicing regulatory element determining CDKN2A exon 3 usage (P=0.01). These findings provide new insights into the critical role of the CDKN2 locus in BCP-ALL aetiology.",,"['Hungate, Eric A', 'Vora, Sapana R', 'Gamazon, Eric R', 'Moriyama, Takaya', 'Best, Timothy',

METHODS: PsA was isolated from P. chinensis, and its effects of differentiation induction on both AML cell lines and the primary leukemia cells were investigated. RESULTS: Compared with the untreated control, PsA induced the differentiation of U937 cells, K562 cells and HL-60 cells, represented as the increased CD15+ cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all the three AML cell lines, after PsA treatment. As the same time, the cell morphology of these AML cells was changed correspondingly; the cytoplasm/nuclei ratio was increased, basophilic cytoplasm was decreased, and eccentric nucleus and granules were also observed. Also, the same effects of differentiation induction by PSA were confirmed in the primary leukemia cells. However, the specific MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 effectively abrogated the differentiation induced by PsA in vitro.

The patient showed a high number of abnormal peripheral lymphocytes, thrombocytopenia, and severe splenomegaly but no lymphadenopathy. Histology of the resected spleen showed small-sized lymphoma cells diffusely infiltrating the red pulp without follicle formation. By immunohistochemistry, lymphoma cells were negative for CD3, CD5, CD8, CD10, CD34, cyclin-D1, and annexin A1 but positive for CD20 and BCL2. BRAF V600E mutation was not observed. Bone marrow aspirate showed preserved normal hematopoietic cells with invasion of lymphoma cells in an interstitial pattern without obvious nodules. The cells had abundant pale cytoplasm and round nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli. After natural drying, the cells had unevenly distributed microvilli.

Currently, most of these systems apply heterogeneous and proprietary data models, which impede data exchange and integrated data analysis for scientific purposes. Due to the complexity of medical terminology, the overall number of medical data models is very high. At present, the vast majority of these models are not available to the scientific community. The objective of the Portal of Medical Data Models (MDM, https://medical-data-models.org) is to foster sharing of medical data models. METHODS: MDM is a registered European information infrastructure. It provides a multilingual platform for exchange and discussion of data models in medicine, both for medical research and healthcare. The system is developed in collaboration with the University Library of Munster to ensure sustainability. A web front-end enables users to search, view, download and discuss data models. Eleven different export formats are available (ODM, PDF, CDA, CSV, MACRO-XML, REDCap, SQL, SPSS, ADL, R, XLSX). MDM contents were analysed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: MDM contains 4387 current versions of data models (in total 10,963 versions). 2475 of these models belong to oncology trials. The most common keyword (n = 3826) is 'Clinical Trial'; most frequent diseases are breast cancer, leukemia, lung and colorectal neoplasms. Most common languages of data elements are English (n = 328,557) and German (n = 68,738). Semantic annotations (UMLS codes) are available for 108,412 data items, 2453 item groups and 35,361 code list items. Overall 335,087 UMLS codes are assigned with 21,847 unique codes. Few UMLS codes are used several thousand times, but there is a long tail of rarely used codes in the frequency distribution. DISCUSSION: Expected benefits of the MDM portal are improved and accelerated design of medical data models by sharing best practice, more standardised data models with semantic annotation and better information exchange between information systems, in particular Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. Contents of the MDM portal need to be further expanded to reach broad coverage of all relevant medical domains. Database URL: https://medical-data-models.org.",['(c) The Author(s) 2016.

The disease remains largely under-diagnosed in India and Southeast Asian countries. Although in majority of cases it is sporadic, disease may be inherited in a autosomal recessive pattern and rarely, in autosomal dominant pattern. Patients, in addition to frequent sino-pulmonary infections, are also susceptible to various autoimmune diseases and malignancy, predominantly lymphoma and leukemia. Other characteristic lesions include lymphocytic and granulomatous interstitial lung disease, and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of gut. Diagnosis requires reduced levels of at least two immunoglobulin isotypes: IgG with IgA and/or IgM and impaired specific antibody response to vaccines. A number of gene mutations have been described in CVID; however, these genetic alterations account for less than 20% of cases of CVID. Flow cytometry aptly demonstrates a disturbed B cell homeostasis with reduced or absent memory B cells and increased CD21(low) B cells and transitional B cell populations. Approximately one-third of patients with CVID also display T cell functional defects. Immunoglobulin therapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Immunologists and other clinicians in India and other South East Asian countries need to be aware of CVID so that early diagnosis can be made, as currently, majority of these patients still go undiagnosed.",,"['Saikia, Biman', 'Gupta, Sudhir']","['Saikia B', 'Gupta S']","['Department of Immunopathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India. bimansaikia@gmail.com.', 'Programs in Primary Immunodeficiencies and Human Aging, Division of Basic and Clinical Immunology, University of California, Irvine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160212,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Common Variable Immunodeficiency/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive/*methods']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Autoimmunity', 'Clinical manifestations', 'Common variable immunodeficiency', 'Immunological changes']",2016/02/13 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12098-016-2038-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12098-016-2038-x [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2016 Apr;83(4):338-44. doi: 10.1007/s12098-016-2038-x.

However, serious side effects such as allergic or hypersensitivity reactions are common for L-asparaginase treatment. Methods for minimizing immune response on L-asparaginase treatment in human include bioengeneering of less immunogenic version of the enzyme or utilizing the homologous enzymes of different origin. To rationalize these approaches we compared immunogenicity of L-asparaginases from five bacterial organisms and performed sequence-structure analysis of the presumable epitope regions. METHODS: IgG and IgM immune response in C57B16 mice after immunization with Wollinella succinogenes type II (WsA), Yersinia pseudotuberculosis type II (YpA), Erwinia carotovora type II (EwA), and Rhodospirillum rubrum type I (RrA) and Escherichia coli type II (EcA) L-asparaginases was evaluated using standard ELISA method. The comparative bioinformatics analysis of structure and sequence of the bacterial L-asparaginases presumable epitope regions was performed. RESULTS: We showed different immunogenic properties of five studied L-asparaginases and confirmed the possibility of replacement of EcA with L-asparaginase from different origin as a second-line treatment. Studied L-asparaginases might be placed in the following order based on the immunogenicity level: YpA > RrA, WsA >/= EwA > EcA. Most significant cross-immunogenicity was shown between EcA and YpA. We propose that a long N-terminus of YpA enzyme enriched with charged aminoacids and tryptophan could be a reason of higher immunogenicity of YpA in comparison with other considered enzymes. Although the recognized structural and sequence differences in putative epitope regions among five considered L-asparaginases does not fully explain experimental observation of the immunogenicity of the enzymes, the performed analysis set the foundation for further research in this direction. CONCLUSIONS: The performed studies showed different immunogenic properties of L-asparaginases and confirmed the possibility of replacement of EcA with L-asparaginase from different origin. The preferable enzymes for the second line treatment are WsA, RrA, or EwA.",,"['Pokrovsky, Vadim S', 'Kazanov, Marat D', 'Dyakov, Ilya N', 'Pokrovskaya, Marina V', 'Aleksandrova, Svetlana S']","['Pokrovsky VS', 'Kazanov MD', 'Dyakov IN', 'Pokrovskaya MV', 'Aleksandrova SS']","['V.N.

Clinical and diagnostic data were collected and available MRI studies were reviewed. We performed genealogy and haplotype analyses and measured serum ADA2 activity. ADA2 activity values were correlated to clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Age of presentation differed widely between the nine presented patients (range: 0 months to 8 years). The main clinical manifestations were (hepato)splenomegaly (8/9), skin involvement (8/9) and neurological involvement (8/9, of whom 6 encountered stroke). Considerable variation was seen in type, frequency and intensity of other symptoms, which included aplastic anaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia and cutaneous ulcers. Common laboratory abnormalities included cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinaemia. ADA2 enzyme activity in patients was significantly decreased compared with healthy controls. ADA2 activity levels tended to be lower in patients with stroke compared with patients without stroke. Genealogical studies did not identify a common ancestor; however, based on allele frequency, a North-West European founder effect can be noted. Three patients underwent haematopoietic cell transplantation, after which ADA2 activity was restored and clinical symptoms resolved. CONCLUSION: This case series revealed large phenotypic variability in patients with ADA2 deficiency though they were homozygous for the same R169Q mutation inCECR1 Disease modifiers, including epigenetic and environmental factors, thus seem important in determining the phenotype. Furthermore, haematopoietic cell transplantation appears promising for those patients with a severe clinical phenotype.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Herein, the first proteomic study of 8a effects in CCRF-CEM cells was performed by 2D nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS to better understand the mechanisms of action of 8a. Data analyses based on PLGS, STRING, Cytoscape, and database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery identified 55 proteins that were differentially expressed in response to 8a exposure. Multiple cellular pathways were affected, including chromatin organization, energy metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative-stress, and apoptosis. The changes in protein expression were further verified for PKM2. Moreover, 8a lowered down the expression of HEX and PFK-1. Lactate production was decreased in 8a-treated cells, indicating suppression of glycolysis. The elevated XRCC6 and decreased histone expression levels suggested increased DNA damage in 8a-treated cells, which was confirmed by the increased gamma-H2AX foci. Molecular docking of 8a with DNA demonstrated direct interactions of 8a with DNA through three hydrogen bonds and four pi-pi interactions, potentially explaining the mode of action that 8a damaged to DNA. The differential protein profiling and dysfunction of metabolic pathways induced by 8a provide novel insights into the potential action mechanisms of 8a.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Neoplastic transformation has been partially attributed to hyperactive MYD88 signaling, secondary to the MYD88 L265P mutation, occurring in the majority of WM patients. Nevertheless, the presence of chronic active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, a feature of multiple IgM+ B-NHL, remains a subject of speculation in WM. Here, we interrogated the BCR signaling capacity of primary WM cells by utilizing multiparametric phosphoflow cytometry and found heightened basal phosphorylation of BCR-related signaling proteins, and augmented phosphoresponses on surface IgM (sIgM) crosslinking, compared with normal B cells. In support of those findings we observed high sIgM expression and loss of phosphatase activity in WM cells, which could both lead to signaling potentiation in clonal cells. Finally, led by the high-signaling heterogeneity among WM samples, we generated patient-specific phosphosignatures, which subclassified patients into a 'high' and a 'healthy-like' signaling group, with the second corresponding to patients with a more indolent clinical phenotype.

In this study we examined the expression and oncogenic function of HOX genes in mesothelioma, a cancer arising from the pleura or peritoneum which is associated with exposure to asbestos. METHODS: We tested the sensitivity of the mesothelioma-derived lines MSTO-211H, NCI-H28, NCI-H2052, and NCI-H226 to HXR9, a peptide antagonist of HOX protein binding to its PBX co-factor. Apoptosis was measured using a FACS-based assay with Annexin, and HOX gene expression profiles were established using RT-QPCR on RNA extracted from cell lines and primary mesotheliomas. The in vivo efficacy of HXR9 was tested in a mouse MSTO-211H flank tumor xenograft model. RESULTS: We show that HOX genes are significantly dysregulated in malignant mesothelioma. Targeting HOX genes with HXR9 caused apoptotic cell death in all of the mesothelioma-derived cell lines, and prevented the growth of mesothelioma tumors in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, the sensitivity of these lines to HXR9 correlated with the relative expression of HOX genes that have either an oncogenic or tumor suppressive function in cancer. The analysis of HOX expression in primary mesothelioma tumors indicated that these cells could also be sensitive to the disruption of HOX activity by HXR9, and that the expression of HOXB4 is strongly associated with overall survival. CONCLUSION: HOX genes are a potential therapeutic target in mesothelioma, and HOXB4 expression correlates with overall survival.",,"['Morgan, Richard', 'Simpson, Guy', 'Gray, Sophie', 'Gillett, Cheryl', 'Tabi, Zsuzsanna', 'Spicer, James', 'Harrington, Kevin J', 'Pandha, Hardev S']","['Morgan R', 'Simpson G', 'Gray S', 'Gillett C', 'Tabi Z', 'Spicer J', 'Harrington KJ', 'Pandha HS']","['Institute of Cancer Therapeutics, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Richmond Road, Bradford, BD7 1DP, UK.

DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive analysis. METHODS: Analysis of data from the Zimbabwe National Cancer Registry for the period 2000-2009. SETTING: The Zimbabwe National Cancer Registry. RESULTS: Childhood Cancer constituted 3.8% of all malignancies recorded at the cancer registry during the study period. The common cancers were: Wilm's Tumour 286 (16.2%), Kaposi Sarcoma 277 (15.7%), Retinoblastoma 231 (13.1%), Non- Hodgkins lymphoma 182 (10.3%), leukemia 158 (8.9%), brain and nervous tissue 107 (6.1%), connective tissue 105 (5.9%), bone 97 (5.5%), Hodgkins lymphoma 57 (3.2%), Non-melanoma skin 33 (1.9%). All the other remaining cancers were 233 (13.2%). Burkits lymphoma constituted only 2% of all cancers. The noted pattern of cancers in this study were compared to patterns from other countries and similarities and differences are discussed. CONCLUSION: This study showed high incidence rates of Nephroblastoma, Retinoblastoma and Kaposi sarcoma. In contrast to high income countries leukemia and brain tumours are more prevalent in older age group. Compared to other countries in Africa, Burkits lymphoma was rare. Further research is required to identify factors that influence relative frequencies in childhood cancers in Zimbabwe.

Furthermore, variation in TCL1A expression influenced the downstream expression of proinflammatory cytokines and cytokine receptors. Specifically, the top hit genome-wide association study SNP, rs11849538, created a functional estrogen response element (ERE) that displayed estrogen receptor (ER) binding and increased E2 induction of TCL1A expression only for the variant SNP genotype. In the present study, we pursued mechanisms underlying the E2-SNP-dependent regulation of TCL1A expression and, in parallel, our subsequent observations that SNPs at a distance from EREs can regulate ERalpha binding and that ER antagonists can reverse phenotypes associated with those SNPs. Specifically, we performed a series of functional genomic studies using a large panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines with dense genomic data that demonstrated that TCL1A SNPs at a distance from EREs can modulate ERalpha binding and expression of TCL1A as well as the expression of downstream immune mediators. Furthermore, 4-hydroxytamoxifen or fulvestrant could reverse these SNP-genotype effects. Similar results were found for SNPs in the IL17A cytokine and CCR6 chemokine receptor genes. These observations greatly expand our previous results and support the existence of a novel molecular mechanism that contributes to the complex interplay between estrogens and immune systems. They also raise the possibility of the pharmacological manipulation of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in a SNP genotype-dependent fashion.",,"['Ho, Ming-Fen', 'Bongartz, Tim', 'Liu, Mohan', 'Kalari, Krishna R', 'Goss, Paul E', 'Shepherd, Lois E', 'Goetz, Matthew P', 'Kubo, Michiaki', 'Ingle, James N', 'Wang, Liewei', 'Weinshilboum, Richard M']","['Ho MF', 'Bongartz T', 'Liu M', 'Kalari KR', 'Goss PE', 'Shepherd LE', 'Goetz MP', 'Kubo M', 'Ingle JN', 'Wang L', 'Weinshilboum RM']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology (M.-F.H., M.L., L.W., R.M.W.), Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Division of Rheumatology (M.-F.H., T.B.), Department of Medicine, Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics (K.R.K.), Department of Health Sciences Research, and Division of Medical Oncology (M.P.G., J.N.I.), Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905;

The present study aimed to define the roles of CD74 and MIF in the immune surveillance escape process. Towards this direction, the cell lines HL-60, Raji, K562 and primary pre-B leukemic cells were examined for expression and secretion of MIF. Flow cytometry analysis detected high levels of MIF and intracellular/membrane CD74 expression in all leukemic cells tested, while MIF secretion was shown to be inversely proportional to intracellular HLA-DR (DR) expression. In the MHCII-negative cells, IFN-gamma increased MIF expression and induced its secretion in HL-60 and K562 cells, respectively.

RECENT FINDINGS: Cross-talk between bone marrow tumor cells and surrounding cells, including endothelial cells, is important for tumor growth in hematologic neoplasia. In addition to conventional signaling pathways, exosomes, which are small endosome-derived vesicles containing miRNAs, can help to modulate the microenvironment without directly contacting nontumorous cells. The human myeloid leukemia cell line K562 secretes exosomes containing a large amount of miR-92a that enhances angiogenesis under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. With chronic hypoxia, exosomes secreted by multiple myeloma cells also enhance angiogenesis by targeting factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 via miR-135b. SUMMARY: Intercellular communication between tumor cells and a heterogeneous population of bone marrow stromal cells is mediated by exosomes containing various functional proteins, mRNA, and miRNA. Hypoxia is a major regulator of exosomal content and affects angiogenesis in various types of hematologic neoplasia. Functional analysis of exosomes and exosome-mediated cell-cell interactions not only clarifies molecular pathogenesis but also suggests new treatment strategies for hematologic neoplasia through targeting exosomes.",,"['Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Umezu, Tomohiro', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Umezu T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['aDepartment of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science bDepartments of Molecular Science cHematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*blood supply/*pathology', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism/*pathology', '*Tumor Hypoxia']",,,,2016/02/13 06:00,2016/12/22 06:00,['2016/02/12 06:00'],"['2016/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000235 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 May;23(3):268-73. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000235.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, infectious complications are common during LITR treatment and might hamper the beneficial effect of these drugs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence of and predisposing risk factors for infections during LITR treatment of AML, as well as the value of antibiotic prophylaxis within this setting. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 40 AML patients, treated with 215 cycles of LITR and analyzed putative risk factors by multivariate logistic regression. Infections occurred in 53/215 (25%) of LITR cycles, resulting in death in six patients. Of the parameters assessed at the start of each LITR cycle, transfusion dependence (p=0.008) and increased LDH (p=0.027) independently predicted the occurrence of infection. Most importantly, however, antibiotic prophylaxis was independently associated with a decreased rate of infectious complications (p=0.030). It was regularly performed in neutropenic patients and even managed to eliminate low neutrophil counts as risk factor in multivariate models. These data argue for the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis during LITR therapy of AML and suggest its further evaluation within a prospective clinical trial.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The clinical-pathological characteristics were also recorded. Immunological category was assigned using the EGIL criteria. RESULTS: There were 88 AML and 42 ALL patients analysed for immunophenotypes. Only tw cases of biphenotypic leukemia were found. The commonest overall AML morphological sub-type was AML-M2, 26 (29.5%). Majority of ALL cases were B-cell immunological sub-type (96.6%). Early pre-B phenotype constituted 62.07% and Common B-cell ALL 37.93%. There were only 4 cases of T-cell ALL.

Over expression evaluation of HDACs in leukemias may be a new approach for diagnosis of leukemia, which can present new targets for leukemia therapy. HDIs inhibit HDACs, increase acetylation in histones, cause up- or down regulation in some genes and result in differentiation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction in malignant cells via cytotoxic effects.

For adults the recommended daily dosage of 400 mg requires simultaneous intake of up to four capsules or tablets each 100 mg. A new 400 mg film coated tablet developed due to the need to swallow multiple capsules or tablets per dose and that was a negative impact on treatment adherence. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A group of 36 patients were randomly assigned to receive Imatinib as 4x100 mg capsules, 4x100 mg tablets and 1x400 mg tablet. Blood sampling was performed for up to 48 h after first dosing. After that, subjects were monitored to assess drug related adverse events. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using concentration-time curves for plasma Imatinib and its metabolite. RESULTS: Mean area under the curve (AUC (0-infinity)) values were 27011, 25811 and 25699 ng/ml for 4x100 mg capsules, 4x100 mg tablets and 1x400 mg tablets, respectively. Cmax values were 1548, 1605 and 1622 ng/ml and t1/2 values were 15.7, 15.8 and 15.6 h. The Test/Reference ratios for AUC (0-infinity), AUC (0-48), and Cmax were 0.99, 0.99 and 1.02 for 4x100 mg tablets versus 4x100 mg capsules and 0.96, 0.96 and 0.99 for 1x400 mg tablet versus 4x100 mg capsules. The 95% confidence intervals were fully contained within the accepted interval. The mild and moderate adverse events considered to be drug related were reported.

These exogenous MLVs derive from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) that were acquired by the wild mouse progenitors of laboratory mice about 1 million years ago. We analyzed the genomes of seven MLVs isolated from Eurasian and American wild mice and three previously sequenced MLVs to describe their relationships and identify their possible ERV progenitors. The phylogenetic tree based on the receptor-determining regions ofenvproduced expected host range clusters, but these clusters are not maintained in trees generated from other virus regions. Colinear alignments of the viral genomes identified segmental homologies to ERVs of different host range subgroups. Six MLVs show close relationships to a small xenotropic ERV subgroup largely confined to the inbred mouse Y chromosome.envvariations define three E-MLV subtypes, one of which carries duplications of various sizes, sequences, and locations in the proline-rich region ofenv Outside theenvregion, all E-MLVs are related to different nonecotropic MLVs. These results document the diversity in gammaretroviruses isolated from globally distributedMussubspecies, provide insight into their origins and relationships, and indicate that recombination has had an important role in the evolution of these mutagenic and pathogenic agents. IMPORTANCE: Laboratory mice carry mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs) of three host range groups which were acquired from their wild mouse progenitors. We sequenced the complete genomes of seven infectious MLVs isolated from geographically separated Eurasian and American wild mice and compared them with endogenous germ line retroviruses (ERVs) acquired early in house mouse evolution. We did this because the laboratory mouse viruses derive directly from specific ERVs or arise by recombination between different ERVs. The six distinctively different wild mouse viruses appear to be recombinants, often involving different host range subgroups, and most are related to a distinctive, largely Y-chromosome-linked MLV ERV subtype.

SUN2 is an inner nuclear membrane protein belonging to the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex. We have analyzed here the role of SUN2 in HIV infection. We report that in contrast to what was initially thought, SUN2 is not induced by type I interferon, and that SUN2 silencing does not modulate HIV infection. However, SUN2 overexpression in cell lines and in primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells inhibits the replication of HIV but not murine leukemia virus or chikungunya virus. We identified HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains that are unaffected by SUN2, suggesting that the effect is specific to particular viral components or cofactors. Intriguingly, SUN2 overexpression induces a multilobular flower-like nuclear shape that does not impact cell viability and is similar to that of cells isolated from patients with HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia or with progeria. Nuclear shape changes and HIV inhibition both mapped to the nucleoplasmic domain of SUN2 that interacts with the nuclear lamina. This block to HIV replication occurs between reverse transcription and nuclear entry, and passaging experiments selected for a single-amino-acid change in capsid (CA) that leads to resistance to overexpressed SUN2. Furthermore, using chemical inhibition or silencing of cyclophilin A (CypA), as well as CA mutant viruses, we implicated CypA in the SUN2-imposed block to HIV infection. Our results demonstrate that SUN2 overexpression perturbs both nuclear shape and early events of HIV infection. IMPORTANCE: Cells encode proteins that interfere with viral replication, a number of which have been identified in overexpression screens. SUN2 is a nuclear membrane protein that was shown to inhibit HIV infection in such a screen, but how it blocked HIV infection was not known. We show that SUN2 overexpression blocks the infection of certain strains of HIV before nuclear entry. Mutation of the viral capsid protein yielded SUN2-resistant HIV. Additionally, the inhibition of HIV infection by SUN2 involves cyclophilin A, a protein that binds the HIV capsid and directs subsequent steps of infection. We also found that SUN2 overexpression substantially changes the shape of the cell's nucleus, resulting in many flower-like nuclei. Both HIV inhibition and deformation of nuclear shape required the domain of SUN2 that interacts with the nuclear lamina. Our results demonstrate that SUN2 interferes with HIV infection and highlight novel links between nuclear shape and viral infection.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Measurement of MRD from bone marrow at the end of induction chemotherapy (day 28) for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) can highlight a large group of patients (>40%) with an excellent (>90%) short-term event-free survival (EFS). However, follow-up in recent published trials is relatively short, raising concerns about using this result to infer the safety of further therapy reduction in the future. METHODS: We examined MRD data on 225 patients treated on one of three UKALL trials between 1997 and 2003 to assess the long-term (>10 years follow-up) outcome of those patients who had low-risk MRD (<0.01%) at day 28. RESULTS: Our pilot data define a cohort of 53% of children with MRD <0.01% at day 28 who have an EFS of 91% and long-term overall survival of 97%. Of 120 patients with day-28 MRD <0.01% and extended follow-up, there was one death due to treatment-related toxicity, one infectious death while in complete remission, and four relapse deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The excellent outcome for childhood ALL in patients with MRD <0.01% after induction chemotherapy is sustained for more than 10 years from diagnosis. This supports the potential exploration of further reduction of therapy in this group, in an attempt to reduce treatment-related mortality and late effects.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In this study, we found that GAP43 can be induced by the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rat brain astrocytes both in vivo and in vitro. The LPS-induced astrocytic GAP43 expression was mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)- and interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent transcriptional activation. The overexpression of the PKC phosphorylation-mimicking GAP43(S41D) (constitutive active GAP43) in astrocytes mimicked LPS-induced process arborization and elongation, while application of a NF-kappaB inhibitory peptide TAT-NBD or GAP43(S41A) (dominant-negative GAP43) or knockdown of GAP43 all inhibited astrogliosis responses. Moreover, GAP43 knockdown aggravated astrogliosis-induced microglial activation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We also show that astrogliosis-conditioned medium from GAP43 knock-down astrocytes inhibited GAP43 phosphorylation and axonal growth, and increased neuronal damage in cultured rat cortical neurons. These proneurotoxic effects of astrocytic GAP43 knockdown were accompanied by attenuated glutamate uptake and expression of the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) in LPS-treated astrocytes. The regulation of EAAT2 expression involves actin polymerization-dependent activation of the transcriptional coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1), which targets the serum response elements in the promoter of rat Slc1a2 gene encoding EAAT2. In sum, the present study suggests that astrocytic GAP43 mediates glial plasticity during astrogliosis, and provides beneficial effects for neuronal plasticity and survival and attenuation of microglial activation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Astrogliosis is a complex state in which injury-stimulated astrocytes exert both protective and harmful effects on neuronal survival and plasticity. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a well known growth cone protein that promotes axonal regeneration, can be induced in rat brain astrocytes by the proinflammatory endotoxin lipopolysaccharide via both nuclear factor-kappaB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-mediated transcriptional activation. Importantly, LPS-induced GAP43 mediates plastic changes of astrocytes while attenuating astrogliosis-induced microglial activation and neurotoxicity. Hence, astrocytic GAP43 upregulation may serve to indicate beneficial astrogliosis after CNS injury.",['Copyright (c) 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/362028-17$15.00/0.'],"['Hung, Chia-Chi', 'Lin, Chun-Hua', 'Chang, Hsuan', 'Wang, Chen-Yu', 'Lin, Shang-Hsuan', 'Hsu, Pei-Chien', 'Sun, Yu-Yo', 'Lin, Teng-Nan', 'Shie, Feng-Shiun', 'Kao, Lung-Sen', 'Chou, Chih-Ming', 'Lee, Yi-Hsuan']","['Hung CC', 'Lin CH', 'Chang H', 'Wang CY', 'Lin SH', 'Hsu PC', 'Sun YY', 'Lin TN', 'Shie FS', 'Kao LS', 'Chou CM', 'Lee YH']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences and Departments of Physiology and Department and Institute of Physiology, College of Medicine.', 'Department of Nursing, Kang-Ning University, Taipei 114, Taiwan.', 'Department and Institute of Physiology, College of Medicine.', 'Department and Institute of Physiology, College of Medicine, Brain Research Center, and.', 'Department and Institute of Physiology, College of Medicine.', 'Department and Institute of Physiology, College of Medicine, Brain Research Center, and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia 30322."", 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan, and.', 'Center for Neuropsychiatric Research, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County 350, Taiwan.', 'Brain Research Center, and Department of Life Sciences, Institute of Genomic Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences and Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences and Departments of Physiology and Department and Institute of Physiology, College of Medicine, Brain Research Center, and yhlee3@ym.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2)', '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, rat)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Slc1a2 protein, rat)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, rat)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'GAP-43 Protein/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gliosis/*genetics', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Microglia/*drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors']",PMC6602016,['NOTNLM'],"['EAAT2', 'GAP43', 'MKL1', 'astrogliosis', 'microglial activation', 'neurotoxicity']",2016/02/13 06:00,2016/07/02 06:00,['2016/02/12 06:00'],"['2016/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['36/6/2027 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3457-15.2016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2016 Feb 10;36(6):2027-43. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3457-15.2016.,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5659-2207', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3213-827X']",,,,,,,,

Folate conjugated to immunoglobulin (F-IgG) could direct innate immune cells with Fc receptors to folate receptor-expressing cancer cells. F-IgG bound to human KB and HeLa cells, as well as murine L1210JF, a folate receptor (FR)-overexpressing cancer cell line, as determined by flow cytometry. Recognition of F-IgG by natural killer (NK) cell Fc receptors led to phosphorylation of the ERK transcription factor and increased NK cell expression of CD69. Lysis of KB tumor cells by NK cells increased by about 5-fold after treatment with F-IgG, an effect synergistically enhanced by treatment with IL2, IL12, IL15, or IL21 (P< 0.001). F-IgG also enhanced the lysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by autologous NK cells. NK cells significantly increased production of IFNgamma, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES in response to F-IgG-coated KB target cells in the presence of the NK cell-activating cytokine IL12, and these coculture supernatants induced significant T-cell chemotaxis (P< 0.001).

Studies in a murine leukemia model confirmed the intratumoral localization and antitumor activity of F-IgG, as well as enhancement of its effects by IL12 (P =0.05).

In this study, we describe the behavior of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) inside microfluidic chambers (microchambers) operated under conditions of minimal perfusion. mESCs inside microchambers formed colonies and expressed markers of pluripotency in the absence of feeders or pluripotency-inducing signals such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), while mESCs in standard cultureware differentiated rapidly. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that remarkable differences in stem cell phenotype are due to endogenous production of LIF and other growth factors brought upon by cultivation in confines of a microchamber in the absence of perfusion (dilution). At the protein level, mESCs produced approximately 140 times more LIF inside microchambers than under standard culture conditions. In addition, we demonstrate that pluripotent phenotype of stem cells could be degraded by increasing the height (volume) of the microchamber. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of LIF in microchambers, via the JAK/STAT3 pathway, leads to preferential differentiation into mesoderm that is driven by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to design a cell culture system where stem cell fate is controlled solely by the endogenous signals. Our study may help shift the paradigm of stem cell cultivation away from relying on expensive exogenous molecules such as growth factors and toward designing culture chambers for harnessing endogenous signals.

In a subset of SM cases, a second associated hematologic non-mast cell disease (AHNMD) is also present, usually of myeloid origin. Polymerase chain reaction and targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization studies have provided evidence that, in at least some cases, the aberrant mast cells are related clonally to the neoplastic cells of the AHNMD. In this work, a single nucleotide polymorphism microarray (SNP-A) was used to characterize the cytogenetics of the aberrant mast cells from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and concomitant mast cell leukemia associated with a KIT D816A mutation. The results demonstrate the presence of shared cytogenetic abnormalities between the mast cells and myeloid blasts, as well as additional abnormalities within mast cells (copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity) not detectable by routine karyotypic analysis. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of SNP-A whole-genome scanning to the detection of shared cytogenetic abnormalities between the two components of a case of SM-AHNMD. The findings provide additional evidence of a frequent clonal link between aberrant mast cells and cells of myeloid AHNMDs, and also highlight the importance of direct sequencing for identifying uncommon activating KIT mutations.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Frederiksen, John K', 'Shao, Lina', 'Bixby, Dale L', 'Ross, Charles W']","['Frederiksen JK', 'Shao L', 'Bixby DL', 'Ross CW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160127,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/*pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,,,2016/02/13 06:00,2016/09/27 06:00,['2016/02/12 06:00'],"['2015/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22342 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2016 Apr;55(4):389-96. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22342.

We evaluated the hypothesis to apply less restrictive radiological criteria to define PFI in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) submitted to chemotherapy. Overall, 73 consecutive episodes of pulmonary infiltrates associated to positive serum galactomannan test or fungal isolation or galactomannan detection from respiratory specimens were considered. CT scans acquired at the onset of symptoms (time-0) and within 4 weeks (time-1) were analysed to identify specific (group A) or aspecific radiological signs (group B). Pulmonary infiltrates fulfilled the EORTC-MSG criteria in 49 patients (group A), whereas in 24 patients (group B) they did not reach the criteria due to aspecific CT findings at time-0. Eleven of 21 (52.4%) patients of the group B evaluable for the evolution of the radiological findings fulfilled EORTC-MSG criteria at time-1.

Previous studies have found conflicting results about certain comorbidities and were limited by small sample sizes. OBJECTIVES: To determine the morbidity and mortality from pemphigus and its treatments in the U.S.A. METHODS: We examined a cross-sectional cohort of 87 039 711 hospitalized patients in the U.S.A. to determine the inpatient comorbidities and mortality of pemphigus. RESULTS: In multivariate survey logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex and race/ethnicity, pemphigus and its treatments were associated with 39 of 122 comorbidities examined. The disorders most strongly associated with pemphigus were Cushing syndrome [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 17.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.41-122.90], adrenal insufficiency (4.08, 1.71-9.73), myasthenia gravis (6.92, 2.55-18.79), mucositis (17.19, 7.73-38.22), herpes infection (7.98, 3.62-17.62), fungal infections (4.03, 3.60-4.52), insomnia (18.02, 2.46-131.88) and hidradenitis (5.34, 1.33-21.43). Among malignancies, only leukaemia (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08-2.24) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1.52, 1.15-2.03) were associated with pemphigus, but not any solid organ malignancies. Patients with a secondary diagnosis of pemphigus had higher inpatient mortality (3.20%, 95% CI 2.71-3.69) than those with a primary (1.60%, 1.29-1.91) or no (1.78%, 1.78-1.78) diagnosis of pemphigus (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pemphigus is associated with increased inpatient mortality, likely through its association with numerous comorbid health conditions.

Recruited to the pre-mRNA by splicing factors, histone deacetylases (HDACs) and K-acetyltransferases (KATs) catalyze dynamic histone acetylation along the gene. In colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells, HDAC inhibition specifically increased KAT2B occupancy as well as H3 and H4 acetylation of the H3K4 trimethylated (H3K4me3) nucleosome positioned over alternative exon 2 of the MCL1 gene, an event paralleled with the exclusion of exon 2. These results were reproduced in MDA-MB-231, but not in MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. These later cells have much higher levels of demethylase KDM5B than either HCT 116 or MDA-MB-231 cells. We show that H3K4me3 steady-state levels and H3K4me3 occupancy at the end of exon 1 and over exon 2 of the MCL1 gene were lower in MCF7 than in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, in MCF7 cells, there was minimal effect of HDAC inhibition on H3/H4 acetylation and H3K4me3 levels along the MCL1 gene and no change in pre-mRNA splicing choice. These results show that, upon HDAC inhibition, the H3K4me3 mark plays a critical role in the exclusion of exon 2 from the MCL1 pre-mRNA. J. Cell. Physiol. 231: 2196-2204, 2016.

Adult cohort studies have reported an association between higher body mass index (BMI) and increased leukemia-related mortality; whether a similar effect exists in childhood leukemia remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether a higher BMI at diagnosis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with worse event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). DESIGN: We searched 4 electronic databases from inception through March 2015 without language restriction and included studies in pediatric ALL or AML (0-21 y of age) reporting BMI as a predictor of survival or relapse. Higher BMI, defined as obese (>/=95%) or overweight/obese (>/=85%), was compared with lower BMI [nonoverweight/obese (<85%)]. Summary risk estimates for EFS, OS, and CIR (ALL only) were calculated with random- or fixed-effects models according to tests for between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 4690 reports identified, 107 full-text articles were evaluated, with 2 additional articles identified via review of citations; 11 articles were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. In ALL, we observed poorer EFS in children with a higher BMI (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.51) than in those at a lower BMI. A higher BMI was associated with significantly increased mortality (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.58) and a statistically nonsignificant trend toward greater risk of relapse (RR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.38) compared with a lower BMI. In AML, a higher BMI was significantly associated with poorer EFS and OS (RR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.60 and RR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.32, 1.86, respectively) than was a lower BMI. CONCLUSION: Higher BMI at diagnosis is associated with poorer survival in children with pediatric ALL or AML.",['(c) 2016 American Society for Nutrition.'],"['Orgel, Etan', 'Genkinger, Jeanine M', 'Aggarwal, Divya', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Nieder, Michael', 'Ladas, Elena J']","['Orgel E', 'Genkinger JM', 'Aggarwal D', 'Sung L', 'Nieder M', 'Ladas EJ']","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; Jonathan Jaques Children's Cancer Center, Miller Children's Hospital Long Beach, Long Beach, CA; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA;"", 'Mailman School of Public Health, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Institute of Human Nutrition, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and.', 'Division of Haemotology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Kids, Toronto, Canada; and.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Institute of Human Nutrition, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY; ejd14@cumc.columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160210,United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Overweight/complications', 'Pediatric Obesity/*complications', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",PMC6546230,['NOTNLM'],"['nutritional status', 'obesity', 'pediatric leukemia', 'relapse', 'survival']",2016/02/13 06:00,2016/07/09 06:00,['2016/02/12 06:00'],"['2015/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ajcn.115.124586 [pii]', '10.3945/ajcn.115.124586 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2016 Mar;103(3):808-17. doi: 10.3945/ajcn.115.124586.

BCR-ABL1-Abl1(-/-) cells generated highly aggressive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-blast phase-like disease in mice compared with less malignant CML-chronic phase-like disease from BCR-ABL1-Abl1(+/+) cells. Additionally, loss of ABL1 stimulated proliferation and expansion of BCR-ABL1 murine leukemia stem cells, arrested myeloid differentiation, inhibited genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis, and facilitated accumulation of chromosomal aberrations. Conversely, allosteric stimulation of ABL1 kinase activity enhanced the antileukemia effect of ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and ponatinib) in human and murine leukemias expressing BCR-ABL1, TEL-ABL1, and NUP214-ABL1.

Nevertheless, there is evidence that immune responses against leukemia-associated antigens (LAA) may play an important role in disease control. Dendritic cell (DC)- based immunotherapy is able to induce T cell responses against LAA and might therefore pose an interesting therapeutic option in CML, especially in the setting of minimal residual disease (MRD). GMP production of DC for clinical vaccination remains a time- and cost- intensive procedure and standardized DC generation is warranted. We asked whether maturation-induction with IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha has an influence on functional properties of DC derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in CML patients. Monocyte-derived DC from healthy donors and from patients with CML were analyzed after maturation-induction with our TNF-alpha-containing standard cytokine cocktail with or without addition of IFN-alpha and/or IFN-gamma. Our results confirm that the addition of IFN-gamma leads to enhanced IL-12 secretion in healthy donors. In contrast, in CML patients, IFN-gamma was not able to increase IL-12 secretion, possibly due to a higher degree of cell adherence and lower cell yield during the cell culture. Our data suggest, that- in contrast to healthy donors-, additional interferons are not beneficial for maturation induction during large-scale DC production in patients with CML.",,"['Florcken, Anne', 'Kopp, Joachim', 'Kolsch, Uwe', 'Meisel, Christian', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Pezzutto, Antonio', 'Westermann, Jorg']","['Florcken A', 'Kopp J', 'Kolsch U', 'Meisel C', 'Dorken B', 'Pezzutto A', 'Westermann J']","['a Department of Hematology , Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite- University Medicine, Campus-Virchow-Klinikum , Berlin , Germany.', 'b Labor Berlin Charite Vivantes GmbH , Berlin , Germany.', 'c Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charite- University Medicine, Campus Berlin-Buch , Berlin , Germany.', 'b Labor Berlin Charite Vivantes GmbH , Berlin , Germany.', 'b Labor Berlin Charite Vivantes GmbH , Berlin , Germany.', 'd Institute of Immunology, Charite- University Medicine, Campus Virchow-Klinikum , Berlin , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology , Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite- University Medicine, Campus-Virchow-Klinikum , Berlin , Germany.', 'b Labor Berlin Charite Vivantes GmbH , Berlin , Germany.', 'e Department of Hematology , Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite- University Medicine Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin , Berlin , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology , Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite- University Medicine, Campus-Virchow-Klinikum , Berlin , Germany.', 'b Labor Berlin Charite Vivantes GmbH , Berlin , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160210,United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*physiology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",PMC4963053,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*DC activation', '*DC generation', '*dendritic cells', '*monocyte-derived DC']",2016/02/13 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2016/02/12 06:00'],"['2016/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21645515.2015.1132965 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2016 May 3;12(5):1117-23. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2015.1132965.

Eighty-four non-transplanted AML patients in first complete remission received relapse-preventive immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride and low-dose interleukin-2 in an international phase IV trial (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01347996). Blood samples were drawn during cycles of immunotherapy and analyzed for CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cell phenotypes in blood. During the first cycle of therapy, a re-distribution of cytotoxic T cells was observed comprising a reduction of T effector memory cells and a concomitant increase of T effector cells. The dynamics of T cell subtypes during immunotherapy prognosticated relapse and survival, in particular among older patients and remained significantly predictive of clinical outcome after correction for potential confounders. Presence of CD8+ T cells with specificity for leukemia-associated antigens identified patients with low relapse risk.

We studied cancer incidence-based mortality by race and sex from 1974 to 2008 of cervix, prostate, colon and rectum, lung, leukemia, liver, pancreas, and stomach in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We developed a model-based mortality rate and examined rate ratio of each calendar period to the first period within each race-sex group. Cancer mortality of cervix, colon and rectum, leukemia, and stomach declined in all groups. Prostate cancer increased first in all racial groups and decreased thereafter at different pace. Lung cancer declined among males of all races but increased among females. Liver cancer increased steadily fast among white and black females, doubled in whites and black males, and climbed slowly in other races. Pancreas cancer declined among black males and females, and changed little among others. Cancer mortality trend presents heterogeneity across sites, races, and sex.

To counter this resistance, new therapeutic agents known as BH3-mimetic small molecules are in development with the goal of antagonizing the function of anti-apoptotic molecules and promoting the induction of apoptosis. To facilitate the testing and modeling of BH3-mimetic agents, we have developed a powerful system for evaluation and screening of agents both in culture and in immune competent animal models by engineering mouse leukemic cells and re-programming them to be dependent on exogenously expressed human anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. Here we demonstrate that this panel of cell lines can determine the specificity of BH3-mimetics to individual anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, BFL-1, and MCL-1), demonstrate whether cell death is due to the induction of apoptosis (BAX and BAK-dependent), and faithfully assess the efficacy of BH3-mimetic small molecules in pre-clinical mouse models.

This randomized-controlled trial analyzed the efficacy of palifermin, administered as a dose during HSCT therapy, as primary prophylaxis on pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: In this study forty-six patients (9-15 years) with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) were analyzed. The patients underwent allogenic HSCT conditioned by myeloablative regimen. Subsequently to randomization, patients in the palifermin group were assigned to receive palifermin, 60 mg/kg, intravenously as a single dose 3 days before and after transplant conditioning regimen cycle. The patients in the Control group received only a placebo treatment. Maximum severity of OM, incidence and duration of ulcerative OM, incidence and duration of severe OM limitations were evaluated. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in the incidence of OM up to grade 3 in the palifermin group compared to the control group was discovered. There was also a reduction, confirmed at 60 days, in the degree of severity of mucositis in the palifermin group, with an average of 1.54 grade in the palifermin group, and of 2.16 in the Control group and in the use of opioid analgesics. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that a single dose of palifermin used as primary prophylaxis during HSTC therapy can prevent severe OM in pediatric patients with ALL and used as secondary prophylaxis can prevent the recurrence of severe OM in high-risk patients with previous mucosal injury and improves the quality of life in pediatric patients with ALL.",,"['Lucchese, Alessandra', 'Matarese, Giovanni', 'Manuelli, Maurizio', 'Ciuffreda, Claudio', 'Bassani, Luca', 'Isola, Gaetano', 'Cordasco, Giancarlo', 'Gherlone, Enrico']","['Lucchese A', 'Matarese G', 'Manuelli M', 'Ciuffreda C', 'Bassani L', 'Isola G', 'Cordasco G', 'Gherlone E']","['Researcher in Dentofacial Orthopedics, Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, Oral Pathology and Implantology, IRCCS, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy - lucchese.alessandra@hsr.it.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,Italy,Minerva Stomatol,Minerva stomatologica,0421071,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloablative Agonists/adverse effects', 'Oral Ulcer/etiology/prevention & control', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology/prevention & control', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Stomatitis/drug therapy/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects']",,,,2016/02/11 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2016/02/11 06:00'],"['2016/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]']",['R18Y2016N01A0043 [pii]'],ppublish,Minerva Stomatol. 2016 Feb;65(1):43-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They provide a suitable environment for cel- lular adhesion, survival, proliferation and differentiation, guide new tissue formation and development, and are one of the outstanding goals of tissue engineering. Electrospinning has recently emerged as a leading technique for producing biomimetic scaffolds with mi- cro to nanoscale topography and a high porosity similar to the natural extracellular matrix (ECM). These scaffolds are comprised of synthetic and natural polymers for tissue engi- neering applications. Several kinds of cells such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and mouse ESCs (mESCs) have been cultured and differentiated on nanofiber scaffolds. mESCs can be induced to differentiate into a particular cell lineage when cultured as em- bryoid bodies (EBs) on nano-sized scaffolds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We cultured mESCs (2500 cells/100 microl) in 96-well plates with knockout Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM-KO) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640), both supplemented with 20% ESC grade fetal bovine serum (FBS) and essential factors in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). mESCs were seeded at a density of 2500 cells/100 microl onto electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers in 96-well plates. The control group comprised mESCs grown on tissue cul- ture plates (TCP) at a density of 2500 cells/100 microl. Differentiation of mESCs into mouse hematopoietic stem cells (mHSCs) was performed by stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6 and Fms-related tyrosine kinase ligand (Flt3-L) cytokines for both the PCL and TCP groups. We performed an experimental study of mESCs differentiation. RESULTS: PCL was compared to conventional TCP for survival and differentiation of mESCs to mHSCs. There were significantly more mESCs in the PCL group. Flowcyto- metric analysis revealed differences in hematopoietic differentiation between the PCL and TCP culture systems. There were more CD34+(Sca1+) and CD133+cells subpopulations in the PCL group compared to the conventional TCP culture system. CONCLUSION: The nanofiber scaffold, as an effective surface, improves survival and differentiation of mESCs into mHSCs compared to gelatin coated TCP. More studies are necessary to understand how the topographical features of electrospun fibers af- fect cell growth and behavior. This can be achieved by designing biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering.",,"['Dehdilani, Nima', 'Shamsasenjan, Karim', 'Movassaghpour, Aliakbar', 'Akbarzadehlaleh, Parvin', 'Amoughli Tabrizi, Bahram', 'Parsa, Hamed', 'Sabagi, Fatemeh']","['Dehdilani N', 'Shamsasenjan K', 'Movassaghpour A', 'Akbarzadehlaleh P', 'Amoughli Tabrizi B', 'Parsa H', 'Sabagi F']","['Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Iran Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tabriz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Iran Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160117,Iran,Cell J,Cell journal,101566618,,,,PMC4746413,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Nanofiber']",2016/02/11 06:00,2016/02/11 06:01,['2016/02/11 06:00'],"['2014/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22074/cellj.2016.3835 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell J. 2016 Winter;17(4):629-38. doi: 10.22074/cellj.2016.3835.

Disruption of proteostasis results in cell stress and adaptation to proteostasis imbalance is mediated by adaptive pathways such as the Heat Shock Response (including heat-shock proteins) or the unfolded protein response (UPR). The BCR-ABL1 kinase (Philadelphia chromosome) is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and defines a historically poor subset in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL). We previously demonstrated the importance of the UPR and particularly of the IRE1/XBP1 signaling axis in Ph(+) ALL, while others demonstrated the therapeutic relevance of HSP70 in ALL. In this regard, HSP70 is regulated by smaller HSP40 s, whose function is so far poorly characterized. RESULTS: Herein, we characterize the expression of HSP40 s in Ph(+) ALL and CML. We show that these genes are not regulated in a pan-class manner and identify a homologous gene pair, namely Auxilin-1 (DNAJC6) and Auxilin-2 (GAK) with a unique expression profile. Overexpression of Auxilin-2, the ubiquitously expressed homologue of Auxilin-1 correlated with superior clinical outcome in ALL and was tightly linked to both IRE1 RNase and BCR-ABL1 kinase activities. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HSP40 gens are uniquely regulated and provide a rationale for further studies between BCR-ABL1/IRE1-based therapies in combination with HSP40 inhibitors, thus opening potentially novel therapeutic avenues.",,"['Vieri, Margherita', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Patterson, John B', 'Panse, Jens', 'Wilop, Stefan', 'Samali, Afshin', 'Chevet, Eric', 'Kharabi Masouleh, Behzad']","['Vieri M', 'Geng H', 'Patterson JB', 'Panse J', 'Wilop S', 'Samali A', 'Chevet E', 'Kharabi Masouleh B']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.', 'MannKind Corporation, Valencia, CA USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland ; Department of Biochemistry, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'INSERM ERL440, Oncogenesis, Stress and Signaling, Universite Rennes 1, Rennes, France ; Centre de Lutte Contre Le Cancer Eugene Marquis, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160209,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC4746784,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Auxilin-1', 'Auxilin-2', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'DNAJ', 'HSP40', 'Unfolded protein response']",2016/02/11 06:00,2016/02/11 06:01,['2016/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-016-0034-5 [doi]', '34 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2016 Feb 9;5:5. doi: 10.1186/s40164-016-0034-5. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although many studies have identified cell-intrinsic alterations in signaling pathways that promote T-ALL growth, the identity of endogenous stromal cells and their associated signals in the tumor microenvironment that support T-ALL remains unknown. By examining the thymic tumor microenvironments in multiple murine T-ALL models and primary patient samples, we discovered the emergence of prominent epithelial-free regions, enriched for proliferating tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs). Systematic evaluation of the functional capacity of tumor-associated stromal cells revealed that myeloid cells, primarily DCs, are necessary and sufficient to support T-ALL survival ex vivo. DCs support T-ALL growth both in primary thymic tumors and at secondary tumor sites. To identify a molecular mechanism by which DCs support T-ALL growth, we first performed gene expression profiling, which revealed up-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (Igf1r) on T-ALL cells, with concomitant expression of their ligands by tumor-associated DCs. Both Pdgfrb and Igf1r were activated in ex vivo T-ALL cells, and coculture with tumor-associated, but not normal thymic DCs, sustained IGF1R activation. Furthermore, IGF1R signaling was necessary for DC-mediated T-ALL survival. Collectively, these studies provide the first evidence that endogenous tumor-associated DCs supply signals driving T-ALL growth, and implicate tumor-associated DCs and their mitogenic signals as auspicious therapeutic targets.",,"['Triplett, Todd A', 'Cardenas, Kim T', 'Lancaster, Jessica N', 'Hu, Zicheng', 'Selden, Hilary J', 'Jasso, Guadalupe J', 'Balasubramanyam, Sadhana', 'Chan, Kathy', 'Li, LiQi', 'Chen, Xi', 'Marcogliese, Andrea N', 'Dave, Utpal P', 'Love, Paul E', 'Ehrlich, Lauren I R']","['Triplett TA', 'Cardenas KT', 'Lancaster JN', 'Hu Z', 'Selden HJ', 'Jasso GJ', 'Balasubramanyam S', 'Chan K', 'Li L', 'Chen X', 'Marcogliese AN', 'Dave UP', 'Love PE', 'Ehrlich LI']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712;', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712;', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712;', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712;', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712;', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712;', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712;', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712;', 'Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;', 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Health Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136;', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Tennessee Valley Healthcare System and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712; lehrlich@austin.utexas.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160209,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (IGF1R protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Somatomedin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PDGFRB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Somatomedin/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/*immunology']",PMC4776467,['NOTNLM'],"['IGF1R', 'T-ALL', 'dendritic cell', 'leukemia', 'tumor microenvironment']",2016/02/11 06:00,2016/07/09 06:00,['2016/02/11 06:00'],"['2016/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1520245113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1520245113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Feb 23;113(8):E1016-25. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1520245113.

Apoptosis-related genes and proteins function in a certain order and timing in the complex network of apoptosis. To further understanding of the apoptotic mechanism of PDT, this research examined the time course of apoptosis from PsD007 (a second-generation photosensitizer developed in China) induced PDT on the rat acute myeloid leukemia cell line LT12. MTT was used to detect the temporal dynamic of PDT killing effects and identified the ""apoptotic window"" of 2-24 h. Apoptosis showed a basal peak at 2 h, and the duration of apoptosis depended on PDT dose, which disappeared quickly at low concentrations but lasted to higher levels to 6 or 12 h at high concentrations as detected by flow cytometry. High-content imaging confirmed these results. An 84-gene apoptosis PCR array identified 15 genes with an expression level change of over twofold at 6 h post-PDT. Nine apoptosis-related genes showed changes in expression at 2-12 h after PDT. TNF family genes TNF and FASLG showed a maximal change of 3.47- and 4.42-fold from baseline. Key apoptosis proteins such as activated caspases showed strong up-regulation after PDT, with the expression peaks of cleaved caspase-7, caspase-9 and PARP at 4-6 h, and cleaved caspase-3 delayed to 6-12 h.

Quantitative PCR and methylationspecific PCR were performed to measure the levels of miR34b and its promoter methylation in normal cells, eight leukemia cell lines as well as primary leukemic cells isolated from patients newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and mixed lymphocytic lymphoma. miR34b levels in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells were significantly lower than those in normal cells. The miR34b promoter was found to be methylated in all leukemia cell lines, 24 of 31 ALL patients and 8 of 19 AML patients, but not in the 23 normal controls. miR34b expression and methylation of its promoter were not associated with most clinical parameters assessed; however, miR34b levels in prednisonesensitive ALL were significantly different from those in insensitive ALL. A cell counting kit8 assay showed that transfection of miR34b mimics into K562 cells inhibited their proliferation. Furthermore, treatment with the demethylating agent 5aza2deoxycytidine significantly enhanced miR34b expression levels and decreased the methylation status of its promoter in HL60 and K562 cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that in pediatric leukemia cells and leukemia cell lines, the expression of miR34b is inhibited by methylation of its promoter, which impairs the restraining effects of miR34b on cell proliferation. It was also indicated that the expression of miR34b in ALL patients may affect their response to early treatments.",,"['Cao, Lan', 'Wang, Na', 'Pan, Jian', 'Hu, Shaoyan', 'Zhao, Wenli', 'He, Hailong', 'Wang, Yi', 'Gu, Guixiong', 'Chai, Yihuan']","['Cao L', 'Wang N', 'Pan J', 'Hu S', 'Zhao W', 'He H', 'Wang Y', 'Gu G', 'Chai Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215003, P.R.

Here, we define four conditions that are necessary and sufficient for direct passage of cancer cells between either vertebrate or invertebrate hosts. Successful transmission requires environment and behaviours that facilitate transfer of tumour cells between hosts including: tumour tissue properties that promote shedding of large numbers of malignant cells, tumour cell plasticity that permits their survival during transmission and growth in a new host, and a 'permissible' host or host tissue.

We computed odds ratios (ORs) between asthma and ALL in the synthetic cohort with and without adjustment for infections and other (including unmeasured) confounders. Only if infection was an extremely strong risk factor for asthma (OR of 10) and an extremely strong protective factor against ALL (OR of 0.1) was the asthma-ALL association compatible with the literature (OR of 0.78). Similarly, strong uncontrolled confounding by an unmeasured factor could downwardly bias the asthma-ALL association, but not enough to replicate findings in the literature.

In addition to the specific tRNAs that prime reverse transcription, all examined retroviruses selectively package multiple host cell noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Many of these ncRNAs appear to be encapsidated shortly after synthesis, before assembling with their normal protein partners. Remarkably, although some packaged ncRNAs, such as pre-tRNAs and the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), were believed to reside exclusively within mammalian nuclei, it was demonstrated recently that the model retrovirus murine leukemia virus (MLV) packages these ncRNAs from a novel pathway in which unneeded nascent ncRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for degradation. The finding that retroviruses package forms of ncRNAs that are rare in cells suggests several hypotheses for how these RNAs could assist retrovirus assembly and infectivity. Moreover, recent experiments in several laboratories have identified additional ways in which cellular ncRNAs may contribute to the retrovirus life cycle. This review focuses on the ncRNAs that are packaged by retroviruses and the ways in which both encapsidated ncRNAs and other cellular ncRNAs may contribute to retrovirus replication.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Eckwahl et al.'],"['Eckwahl, Matthew J', 'Telesnitsky, Alice', 'Wolin, Sandra L']","['Eckwahl MJ', 'Telesnitsky A', 'Wolin SL']","['Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA sandra.wolin@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20160209,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,"['0 (RNA, Nuclear)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'RNA, Untranslated/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/growth & development/*physiology', 'Virion/genetics/physiology', 'Virus Assembly/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",PMC4752605,,,2016/02/11 06:00,2016/12/16 06:00,['2016/02/11 06:00'],"['2016/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.02025-15 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.02025-15 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2016 Feb 9;7(1):e02025-15. doi: 10.1128/mBio.02025-15.,,"['P50 GM103297/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI116381/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007223/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most recipients received nonradiation-based conditioning and a peripheral blood graft from a matched related donor. Using record linkage with death and cancer registries, 79 second cancers were identified a median of 3.5 years after transplantation. The competing-risk adjusted cumulative incidence of second cancers was 3.35% (95% CI, 2.59 to 4.24) at 10 years, and the cancer risk relative to the matched general population was 2.10 (95% CI, 1.65 to 2.56). We observed an excess risk of melanoma and lip, tongue, esophagus, and soft tissue cancers. Cancer risk relative to the general population was elevated for those transplanted for lymphoma, some leukemia subtypes, and severe aplastic anemia, recipients who developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and irrespective of radiation-based conditioning or stem cell source. In those alive 2 years after transplantation (n = 1463), the cumulative incidence of late mortality was 22.2% (95% CI, 19.7 to 24.9) at 10 years, and the risk of death relative to the matched general population was 13.8 (95% CI, 12.2 to 15.6). In multivariable modeling, risk of late death was reduced for females compared with males and those transplanted for chronic myeloid leukemia compared with acute myeloid leukemia; risk was increased for recipients with discordant sex donors, cGVHD, those undergoing second transplants, and disease relapse. Adults undergoing allogeneic transplantation have unique cancer and mortality risk profiles that continue to warrant prevention and surveillance activities targeted at high-risk subgroups.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, post-HCT relapse remains a major problem, particularly in patients with high-risk cytogenetics and in patients who cannot tolerate consolidation chemotherapy (eg, due to previous toxicity). We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of 10-day decitabine (Dec), fludarabine (Flu), and 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) as a new conditioning regimen for allogeneic HCT in patients with MDS, CMML, or AML. Thirty patients were enrolled, including 11 with MDS, 2 with CMML, and 17 with AML. Patients received 20 mg/m(2)/day Dec on days -11 to -2, 30 mg/m(2)/day Flu on days -4 to -2, and 2 Gy TBI on day -1, followed by infusion of a donor stem cell graft on day 0. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil. At a median follow-up of 443 days, the overall survival was 53%, relapse incidence was 27%, and nonrelapse mortality was 27%. The incidence of severe acute (grade III/IV) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 27%, and that of (predominantly mild) chronic GVHD was 60%. Immunomonitoring studies revealed that specific CD8(+) T cell responses against epigenetically silenced tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), including cancer-testis antigens (MAGE-A1/A2/A3 and PRAME) and RHAMM, occurred more frequently in patients who had received Dec/Flu/TBI conditioning (8 of 11 patients) compared with a control group of patients who had received only Flu/TBI conditioning (2 of 9 patients). In summary, Dec/Flu/TBI conditioning proved feasible and effective and enhanced the induction of TAA-reactive CD8(+) T cell responses in vivo, which may contribute to disease control post-transplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanism by which blood glucose fluctuation accelerates renal injury is not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of blood glucose fluctuation on diabetic nephropathy in rats and investigate its underlying mechanism. Diabetes in the rats was induced by a high sugar, high-fat diet, and a single dose of STZ (35 mg/kg)-injected intraperitoneally. Unstable blood sugar models were induced by subcutaneous insulin injection and intravenous glucose injection alternately. Body weight, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbAlc), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), and Creatinine clearance (Ccr) were assessed. T-SOD activity and MDA level were measured by assay kit. Change in renal tissue ultrastructure was observed by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Phosphorylated ser/thr protein kinase (p-AKT) (phosphor-Ser473), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (p-GSK-3beta) (phosphor-Ser9), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCL-2), and cleaved-cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3 (caspase-3) levels were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. We observed that BUN and Scr were increased in diabetic rats, and Ccr was decreased. Furthermore, blood glucose fluctuations could exacerbate the Ccr changes. Renal tissue ultrastructure was also seriously injured by glucose variability in diabetic rats. In addition, glucose fluctuation increased the oxidative stress of renal tissue. Moreover, fluctuating blood glucose decreased p-AKT level and BCL-2, and increased p-GSK-3beta, BAX, cleaved-caspase-3 levels, and ratio of BAX/BCL-2 in the kidneys of diabetic rats. In conclusion, these results suggest that blood glucose fluctuation accelerated renal injury is due, at least in part to its oxidative stress promoting and inhibiting the AKT signaling pathway in diabetic rats.",,"['Ying, Changjiang', 'Zhou, Xiaoyan', 'Chang, Zhenzhen', 'Ling, Hongwei', 'Cheng, Xingbo', 'Li, Wei']","['Ying C', 'Zhou X', 'Chang Z', 'Ling H', 'Cheng X', 'Li W']","[""Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory of Morphology, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, 221004, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. chengxingbo1107@163.com."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. liwei0190@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160209,United States,Endocrine,Endocrine,9434444,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Glucose/*metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/*metabolism', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood glucose fluctuation', 'Cleaved-caspase-3', 'Diabetic nephropathy', 'p-AKT']",2016/02/11 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12020-016-0867-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12020-016-0867-z [pii]']",ppublish,Endocrine. 2016 Jul;53(1):81-96. doi: 10.1007/s12020-016-0867-z.

B6D2F1 mice received 10(4) mouse L1210 leukemia cells via retro-orbital intravenous injection and were then divided into treatment groups, which included: (i) no further treatment, (ii) a single, sub-curative, intraperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (90 microg/gm bw) 24 hr after L1210 cell inoculation, (iii) topical epinephrine (25-400 mM) to clipped dorsal backs 20 min before cyclophosphamide or (iv) orotopical phenylephrine (16-130 mM), epinephrine (10 mM) or norepinephrine (25 mM) 20 min before cyclophosphamide. All mice were then followed until day of death. Differences in median survival time and percent survival between mice receiving cyclophosphamide alone and mice treated with either orotopical phenylephrine, epinephrine or norepinephrine; or topical epinephrine before cyclophosphamide were not significantly different.

It is important to investigate malignant oral cancer progression and development in order to determine useful approaches of prevention of dysplastic lesions. The present study aimed to gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanism of oral carcinogenesis by establishing a rat model of oral carcinogenesis using 4nitroquinoline 1oxide. Subsequently, transcription profile analysis using an integrating microarray was performed. The dynamic gene expression changes of the six stages of rat oral carcinogenesis (normal, mild epithelial dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and oral squamous cell carcinomas) were analyzed using component plane presentations (CPP)selforganizing map (SOM). Six genes were verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity assay kit. Numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified during rat oral carcinogenesis. CPPSOM determined that these DEGs were primarily enriched during cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammatory response and tricarboxylic acid cycle, indicating the coordinated regulation of molecular networks. In addition, the expression of specific DEGs, such as janus kinase 3, cyclindependent kinase A1, Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma 2like 2, nuclear factorkappaB, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A, cyclin D1 and SDH were identified to have high concordance with the results from microarray data.

METHODS: Immunofluorescence evaluation of SIAH2 protein expression and location were conducted in Jurkat cell (a T-ALL cell line) as well as in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) from T-ALL and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients. The expression of SIAH2 mRNA was also examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in these cells. Lentivirus-packed shRNA targeting on SIAH2 (Lv-shSIAH2) was used to knock down SIAH2 expression in Jurkat cells. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and protein levels were then determined by CCK-8 assay, annexin V-PI assay, transwell and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of SIAH2 in BMMNCs from primary T-ALL patients was significantly higher than cells from ITP patients (P=0.0312); There were significant positive associations between SIAH2 expression and the extramedullary infiltration (EMI) (P=0.0003), especially with the mediastinal lymph node metastasis (P=0.0168) and the pleural effusion (P=0.014). However, SIAH2 expression in T-ALL BMMNCs was not correlated with age, gender, white cell count or the clinical risk classification. SIAH2 knockdown by shRNA led to increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, migration and invasion of Jurkat cells. Moreover, Prolyl Hydroxylase (PHD), P27 and Caspase3 were upregulated and HIF-1alpha, VEGF, VEGF Receptor 2, MMP-13, CyclinE1, C-myc and BCL2 were downregulated in SIAH2 knockdown Jurkat cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SIAH2 regulates multi processes in T-ALL and may be an attractive therapeutic target.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
