Cellular folate levels fell, and marked elevations in PRPP levels from 68 +/- 43 to 642 +/- 287 pmol/mg cell protein (mean +/- SD) were observed as KB cells were serially passed through P medium. Human leukemia HL-60 and K562 cells and MJY-alpha mouse mammary tumor cells serially passed in P medium also exhibited 10- to 20-fold elevations in PRPP levels. Glucose consumption, glucose decarboxylation, thymidine and adenosine specific uptake, thymidine incorporation into DNA, and 5-fluorouracil uptake were studied in KB cells with elevated and control PRPP levels. As determined by clonal assay, despite elevated PRPP levels, KB cells cultured in P medium were less sensitive to 5-fluorouracil than cells cultured in S medium unless exogenous folate was added. These data support the concept that endogenous folate levels may be inadequate for optimal 5-FU pharmacological action in KB cells with a modulated increase in PRPP levels.","['Kane, M A', 'Roth, E', 'Raptis, G', 'Schreiber, C', 'Waxman, S']","['Kane MA', 'Roth E', 'Raptis G', 'Schreiber C', 'Waxman S']","['Chemotherapy Foundation Laboratory, Mt.

We have studied the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on the N-myc mRNA levels in Y79 retinoblastoma and LA-N-5 neuroblastoma cells. We showed that when new RNA synthesis was inhibited by actinomycin D the levels of existing N-myc mRNA fell rapidly in both cell lines relative to total cytoplasmic RNA. The half-life for N-myc mRNA was approximately 30 min. Inhibition of protein synthesis by interfering with polypeptide elongation or by inhibiting initiation of protein synthesis increased the levels of N-myc mRNA at least 3-fold after 4 hours. Nuclear runoff transcription experiments showed that the protein synthesis inhibitors did not alter N-myc transcription rates. Combined actinomycin D treatment and treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors indicated that this increase in N-myc transcript levels was due to an increase in the N-myc mRNA lifetimes. Thus, N-myc transcript levels increased because they were more stable in protein synthesis-inhibited cells. Protein synthesis inhibition also increased c-myc mRNA levels in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, but no increase was seen in the relatively low level of c-myc mRNA in protein synthesis-inhibited neuronal tumor cells. These results support the hypothesis that the regulation of N-myc in these neuronal and retinal tumor cells is similar to that of c-myc in other tumor types.","['Amy, C M', 'Bartholomew, J C']","['Amy CM', 'Bartholomew JC']","['Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Retinoblastoma/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Dec 1;47(23):6310-4.,,,,,,,,

Bleomycin treatment of presolubilized chromatin from L1210 nuclei resulted in two types of effect as shown by sedimentation analysis of intact nucleoprotein. The first effect was a dose-dependent fragmentation of chromatin to mononucleosomes (12 S) and subnucleosomal fragments (under 5 S). The second effect was aggregation manifested by the generation of large chromatin particles (over 120 S) that sedimented faster than the original material (20-40 S). Bleomycin treatment of nuclei from L1210 cells resulted in a similar, almost bimodal, size distribution of drug-released chromatin fragments. Increasing levels of bleomycin produced a gradual enhancement of the amount of small fragments (under 5 S) accompanied by generation of large, aggregated particles. Aggregation caused by high drug concentrations significantly reduced the overall extent of chromatin solubilization and allowed only the release of the most degraded fragments from nuclei. The aggregation required intact nucleoprotein, since it was not detected after high-salt deproteinization of bleomycin-treated presolubilized or nuclear chromatin. The aggregation phenomenon reflects a novel activity of bleomycin which may contribute to the drug's antiproliferative properties.","['Woynarowski, J M', 'Gawron, L S', 'Beerman, T A']","['Woynarowski JM', 'Gawron LS', 'Beerman TA']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Chromatin)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bleomycin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatin/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Solubility']",1987/11/20 00:00,1987/11/20 00:01,['1987/11/20 00:00'],"['1987/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4781(87)90067-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(87)90067-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Nov 20;910(2):149-56. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(87)90067-4.,"['CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

In vitro, B cell growth factor (BCGF) can induce proliferation of hairy cells. We have investigated the effect of in vitro and in vivo treatments with different recombinant IFN on the capacity of hairy cells to proliferate in response to human BCGF. In vitro treatment of leukemic cells from HCL patients with recombinant IFN-alpha-2 (5/5 cases) or IFN-beta (4/5 cases) resulted in a marked inhibition of the BCGF-dependent response. This suppressive effect was obtained with IFN concentrations of 1000, 100 IU/ml, and even occasionally 10 IU/ml. In contrast, no such inhibition was observed with IFN-gamma, despite the presence of specific IFN-gamma receptors on hairy cells at densities similar to receptors for IFN-alpha/beta. The IFN-alpha-induced suppression of the proliferative response of hairy cells to BCGF was also observed in vivo in two patients within 6-12 hr after administration of single doses of IFN-alpha. When hairy cells were maintained in culture for 1 week, they recovered their capacity to be stimulated by BCGF. This reversion was also shown in vivo in hairy cells isolated 1 week after IFN administration. Since in vivo growth of hairy cells could possibly result from the autocrine secretion of BCGF, we propose that the therapeutic effect of IFN-alpha on HCL may be due in part to an inhibition of such autocrine loop.","['Genot, E', 'Billard, C', 'Sigaux, F', 'Mathiot, C', 'Degos, L', 'Falcoff, E', 'Kolb, J P']","['Genot E', 'Billard C', 'Sigaux F', 'Mathiot C', 'Degos L', 'Falcoff E', 'Kolb JP']","['U255, INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/metabolism"", 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interferon', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Aug;1(8):590-6.,,,,,,,,

These cultures provide an estimate of the ""self-renewal"" capacity and long-term proliferation potential of AML cells. There was considerably heterogeneity with regard to the effects of individual growth factors, but in general, IL-3, GM-CSF, and G-CSF promoted self-renewal of AML cells, and combinations tended to be more effective in supporting long-term survival of AML-CFU. There was evidence of gradual differentiation, but this was evident in control cells and did not appear to be accelerated by CSF treatment.

Using this approach, we demonstrate that c-fms and CSF-1 transcripts are detectable in HL 60 cells induced along the monocytic lineage but not in uninduced cells. The specific detection of these transcripts is further supported by the absence of histochemical staining in RNase-treated cells and when using pBR322 plasmid without insert as the biotinylated probe.

Differentiated HL-60 cells were considered to be mature macrophages as judged by the positivity of butyrate esterase activity, the acquisition of Fc receptor, and the increment in capacity of phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. The DIA in G2-T-CM was not attributed to interferons known to have DIA, because interferon activity was not found in G2-T-CM by bioassay (less than 4 U/ml) and by radioimmunoassay for gamma-IFN (less than 0.1 U/ml). Molecular weight of DIA was 36,000 Da and separated from CSA of which molecular weight was 22,000 Da by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. DIA and CSA were also separated on chromatofocusing chromatography, because isoelectric point of DIA was mainly less than 4.0 and that of CSA was 4.3-5.7.

The responsiveness of AML populations to CSF stimulation was quantitatively variable but was within the heterogeneous range exhibited by normal granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells. A general concordance was noted between the proliferative effects of GM-CSF and G-CSF on the individual leukemic populations. All AML populations tested specifically bound 125I-labeled murine G-CSF; the level of labeling varied widely and correlated with AML subtype. Labeling levels on individual labeled leukemic cells were within the heterogeneous range exhibited by normal cells, but significant numbers of blast cells in M2, M4, and M5 AMLs appeared to lack membrane receptors for G-CSF. The level of labeling with G-CSF did not correlate with the frequency of clonogenic cells able to be stimulated by G-CSF. The data emphasized that GM-CSF and G-CSF are equivalent proliferative stimuli for human myeloid leukemia cells. Further, despite the potential ability of G-CSF to suppress murine leukemic cells, many AML blast cells lack significant numbers of G-CSF receptors. These considerations warrant caution in future attempts to use G-CSF in the therapy of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Begley, C G', 'Metcalf, D', 'Nicola, N A']","['Begley CG', 'Metcalf D', 'Nicola NA']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Jan;1(1):1-8.,,,,,,,,

Using transient (CAT) and stable (Neor phenotype) transfection assays, we showed that the SNV promoter was used in mouse cells only when the 3' SNV long terminal repeat (LTR) was absent. Infection of mouse cells with recombinant SNV viruses was 1% as efficient as infection of permissive dog (D17) cells. The SNV proviruses in mouse cells appeared normal by Southern blot analysis, indicating that their integration probably occurred by normal mechanisms. S1 nuclease analyses of Neor mouse cell clones, each harboring a single recombinant SNV provirus, showed that the selected (internal) promoter was active, but that the 5' SNV LTR promoter was not. However, in the rare (less than 10(-6)) Neor colonies in which expression of the 5' LTR was selected, both promoters were active. Thus, the block to SNV infection of mouse cells is at least at two levels; one is a 100-fold-decreased efficiency at some step(s) up to and including integration, and the other is at transcription.","['Embretson, J E', 'Temin, H M']","['Embretson JE', 'Temin HM']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'RNA/genetics', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Suppression, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.61.11.3454-3462.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Nov;61(11):3454-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.11.3454-3462.1987.,"['CA-07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC255942,,,,,,

This isolate is unique in that it is not neutralized by a monoclonal antibody which neutralized all other feline leukemia virus isolates tested, including members of the A, B, and C subtypes. Western immunoblotting indicated that the monoclonal antibody was less able to bind to the gp70 of the resistant isolate (designated lambda B1) than to the gp70s of susceptible viruses. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the envelope gene of lambda B1 revealed a high degree of homology with the susceptible Snyder-Theilen, Gardner-Arnstein, and Rickard subtype B isolates, including the presence of a 5-amino-acid minimal binding epitope required for binding by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody. The only change within the vicinity of this epitope was in a single nucleotide, and this difference changed a proline residue to leucine three amino acids from the N terminus of the binding epitope. Competitive binding studies with synthetic peptides indicated that substitution of leucine for proline resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the ability of the peptide to compete for antibody binding to native antigen. The results are consistent with the interpretation that this amino acid change lowers the affinity of antibody binding, resulting in failure of the antibody to neutralize the variant virus.","['Nicolaisen-Strouss, K', 'Kumar, H P', 'Fitting, T', 'Grant, C K', 'Elder, J H']","['Nicolaisen-Strouss K', 'Kumar HP', 'Fitting T', 'Grant CK', 'Elder JH']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes/analysis/*immunology', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.61.11.3410-3415.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Nov;61(11):3410-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.11.3410-3415.1987.,"['5001CA43371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I-CA-43362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC255936,,['GENBANK/J03448'],,,,

To clarify the relationship of LGL/NK cells to T cells we studied patterns of rearrangement and expression of the T cell receptor (Ti) genes alpha, beta, and gamma in normal human LGLs; in CD8+, CD8-, Mol+, and Mol- LGL subsets; and in 17 cases of leukemic LGL proliferations (T gamma LPD). T alpha, T beta, and T gamma genes were not expressed, nor were T beta and T gamma genes rearranged in normal LGLs or LGL subsets. The T gamma LPD were divided into two groups. One group (15/17 cases) was characterized as CD3+ and displayed Ti gene rearrangements. Seven of these cases were reactive with monoclonal antibody WT31, which suggested expression of an alpha/beta heterodimer on the cell surface. The other group (2/17 cases) was CD3- with unrearranged Ti genes. These results indicate that the normal LGL/NK population is homogeneous and distinct from the normal T cell population because it does not express, and as a result, cannot effect its immune function through the T cell receptor molecules. Conversely, T gamma LPDs represent a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative diseases within which the CD3-, Ti- cases most likely represent the neoplastic counterpart of normal LGL cells.

Twelve hybridoma cell lines were selected that secreted monoclonal antibodies capable of binding RBL-2H3 plasma membranes. These antibodies were all of the IgG1, or IgG2a subclass. All 12 antibodies bound to either intact or glutaraldehyde-fixed RBL-2H3 cells. Only one monoclonal (mAb 2AC3) inhibited 125I-labeled IgE binding (IC50 = 65 micrograms/ml compared to 1.0 microgram/ml for unlabeled IgE). This same mAb weakly precipitated the alpha component of the receptor from 125I-surface-labeled cells and directly triggered histamine secretion when incubated with RBL-2H3 cells. Therefore, this hybridoma most likely represents a low affinity anti-receptor antibody. Among the other 11 monoclonals, two caused direct histamine secretion from RBL-2H3 cells. These same two, as well as four others, released greater than 10% of total cellular histamine when rabbit anti-mouse antibody was added to cross-link mAb bound to the cell surface. One monoclonal (mA 1AD3) did not trigger histamine secretion but did inhibit IgE-mediated histamine release when incubated with pre-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. Except for mAb 2AC3, none of the other monoclonal antibodies that caused or inhibited histamine secretion immunoprecipitated receptor or other protein components from either 125I-surface-labeled or intrinsically-labeled cells. However, two monoclonal antibodies (mAb 1CC4 and 1CD1) immunoprecipitated 45,000 and 55,000 proteins from 125I-surface-labeled cells. One hybridoma (mAb 2AA2) that failed to immunoprecipitate surface-labeled proteins did precipitate a 20,000 band from intrinsically-labeled cells. This band increased slightly in apparent mol. wt after reduction and, therefore, was not the previously described gamma component of the receptor. Because several mAb were capable of modulating histamine secretion, it appeared that some of the present monoclonal antibodies bound to undefined membrane components that are crucial to the secretory process of rat basophilic leukemia cells.","['Stracke, M L', 'Basciano, L K', 'Fischler, C', 'Berenstein, E H', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Stracke ML', 'Basciano LK', 'Fischler C', 'Berenstein EH', 'Siraganian RP']","['Clinical Immunology Section, National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Basophils/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', '*Histamine Release', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgE']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(87)90176-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1987 Apr;24(4):347-56. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(87)90176-3.,,,,,,,,

Involvement of interleukin 3.,833-49,"Continuous cell lines could be reproducibly established by culturing spleen cells from adult mice injected with MLV-producer cells or directly infected with Mo-MLV with rIL-2, whereas the culture of normal splenic cells with rIL-2 induced only transient and limited proliferation resulting in no such lines. All of the lines showed morphological characteristics as LGL with Thy-1+,Lyt-1-,L3T4-,Lyt-2-,AsGM1+,FcR gamma+ phenotype without exception, and most of them exhibited typical NK-patterned cytotoxicity. Analysis of reverse transcriptase activity of the culture supernatants as well as Southern hybridization of the DNA from the lines using an Mo-MLV-specific cDNA probe indicated no evidence of retroviral replication or proviral integration, suggesting that the generation of cell lines reflected a reactive process and viral infection was not directly responsible. It was subsequently revealed that Thy-1+,Lyt-1+,Lyt-2- spleen cells from mice infected with Mo-MLV in vivo spontaneously produced surprising amounts of IL-3 in vitro, leading to the possibility that IL-3 was responsible for the generation of lines. The possibility was directly supported by the observation that continuous lines with identical characteristics could be generated completely in vitro by sequential stimulation with rIL-3 and rIL-2 from normal spleen cells without any involvement of Mo-MLV. The C beta gene of TCR was shown to be rearranged in all the lines examined, indicating the LGL lines were all genetically committed to T cell lineage. Unlike the situation in normal splenic populations expanded by rIL-2, where the expression of IL-2-R was progressively lost, constitutive expression of high-affinity-IL-2-R was observed in all the lines and thus, this was considered to explain the unlimited proliferation of them in response to rIL-2 alone. These results suggested the probable role of IL-3 in the regulation of growth and differentiation of a set of LGL committed to T cell lineage. The possible implications of the phenomenon in the regulation of hematopoiesis as well as in the control of Mo-MLV-induced leukemogenesis were discussed.","['Hattori, M', 'Sudo, T', 'Iizuka, M', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Nishio, S', 'Kano, S', 'Minato, N']","['Hattori M', 'Sudo T', 'Iizuka M', 'Kobayashi S', 'Nishio S', 'Kano S', 'Minato N']","['Basic Research Laboratories, Toray Industries, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Spleen/*cytology']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.166.4.833 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1987 Oct 1;166(4):833-49. doi: 10.1084/jem.166.4.833.,,PMC2188738,,,,,,

Such responses differed among cloned variant lines of the RBL-2H3 cell line from undetectable (1A3 bromodeoxyuridine-resistant (BUDRR), 2B1 BUDRR, and 1B3 BUDRR lines) to about 80% of those in the parent RBL-2H3 cells. In all but one line (1B3 thioguanine-resistant (TgR)), the intensities of the phosphoinositide response and of the calcium signal were correlated with the secretory response. The 1B3 TgR line had no detectable calcium signal (as measured by quin 2 fluorescence or uptake of 45Ca2+) but paradoxically showed modest rates of hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and of secretion. The responses of the 1B3 TgR line were, however, dependent on the presence of external Ca2+ ions. The induction of secretion with antigen, therefore, was invariably associated with the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, but it was not necessarily associated with a change in concentration of cytosol Ca2+. All antigen unresponsive clones could secrete when synergistic signals were induced by exposure to the Ca2+ -ionophore, A23187 and the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. These lines, otherwise, had immunoglobulin E receptors and had no obvious defect in their capacity to synthesize the inositol phospholipids or in their phenotypic expression of phospholipase C as measured in cell extracts. One finding of possible relevance to the role of guanosine 5'-triphosphate-regulatory proteins in the activation of phospholipase C was the inability of one antigen-nonresponsive line to respond to NaF (in intact cells) or to guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (in electrically permeabilized cells).","['Woldemussie, E', 'Ali, H', 'Takaishi, T', 'Siraganian, R P', 'Beaven, M A']","['Woldemussie E', 'Ali H', 'Takaishi T', 'Siraganian RP', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Histamine Release', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Oct 1;139(7):2431-8.,,,,,,,,

After measuring the electrochemical equilibrium potential of Na+, K+, and Cl-, the relative contribution of these ions to delta psi p was evaluated by means of ion substitution experiments and by the addition of ion flux inhibitors (tetrodotoxin [TTX], 4-acetoamide-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate [SITS]) and ionophores (Valinomycin, A23187). The Na+ contribution to delta psi p appeared negligible, the potential being essentially generated by K+ and Cl- fluxes. When evaluated by a new mathematical approach, the effects of Valinomycin and A23187 at different times of incubation provided evidence that both the depolarization and the repolarization phase were due to variations of the K+ permeability across the plasma membrane (PK) mediated by Ca2+-activated K+ channels. All the inducers tested (dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO], hexamethylen-bis-acetamide [HMBA], diazepam), although they did not modify the ionic basis of delta psi p, strongly attenuated the depolarization rate of this potential. This attenuation was not brought about when the inducers were added to noninducible MEL cell clonal sublines. Cell commitment occurred only during the depolarization phase and increased proportionally to the attenuation of this phase up to a threshold beyond which the further increase of the attenuation was associated with the inhibition of commitment. The major role of the inducers apparently consisted of the stabilization of the Ca2+-activated K+ channels, suggesting that a properly modulated delta psi p depolarization through these channels is primarily involved in the signal generation for MEL cell commitment to differentiation.","['Arcangeli, A', 'Ricupero, L', 'Olivotto, M']","['Arcangeli A', 'Ricupero L', 'Olivotto M']","['Institute of General Pathology, Medical Faculty of the University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Tetraethylammonium Compounds)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', ""27816-59-7 (4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid)"", '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '4368-28-9 (Tetrodotoxin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'Q3JTX2Q7TU (Diazepam)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"[""4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", 'Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chlorides/metabolism', 'Diazepam/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrochemistry', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Tetraethylammonium Compounds/metabolism', 'Tetrodotoxin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Valinomycin/pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041320302 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 Sep;132(3):387-400. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041320302.,,,,,,,,

The sequence defines a 1047-amino-acid polypeptide precursor with a putative signal sequence, a large extracellular domain with several sites homologous to calcium binding sites in other proteins, a transmembrane domain, and a 32-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain. The 7-kilobase vitronectin receptor alpha subunit mRNA was found to be expressed in all cell lines examined, including endothelial cells, K562 and HEL leukemia cells, and osteosarcoma cells. In the two leukemia cell lines, the expression of the vitronectin receptor mRNA, as well as that of the fibronectin receptor, was enhanced in the presence of phorbol ester, a treatment known to increase the adhesiveness of these cells. The HEL cells were the only ones among the cell lines tested that also contained the mRNA of the platelet adhesion receptor alpha subunit, glycoprotein IIb. The expression of glycoprotein IIb was slightly enhanced by treatment of the cells with phorbol ester.

Cell-surface GPA is derived from two obligatory precursors in a stepwise manner. The initial GPA precursor has a Mr of 27,000 and appears to contain one N-linked high mannose oligosaccharide chain. In tunicamycin-treated cells, the initial precursor is similar in size (Mr = 24,000) to deglycosylated GPA from human erythrocytes. The 27-kDa initial precursor is rapidly converted to a transient 31-kDa intermediate by the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine residues to serine/threonine hydroxyl groups. Subsequent maturation involves the conversion of the high mannose chain to a complex-type oligosaccharide and the concomitant addition of galactose and sialic acid to internal N-acetylgalactosamine residues to extend the O-linked chains. These results define a single, stepwise processing pathway for the generation of all cell-surface GPA molecules and document for the first time the occurrence of both a unique initial precursor that contains a high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide chain but no O-linked sugars and a transient intermediate that appears to contain the same N-linked group and N-acetylgalactosamine at multiple serine/threonine residues. The properties of the intracellular GPA precursors and the relatively simple nature of the processing pathway reported herein contrast markedly with the characteristics of three intermediates and the complexity of two independent pathways in previously postulated schemes for GPA biogenesis (Gahmberg, C.

Using the HL-60 R as a model for resistance to differentiation induction in the HL-60 cell line, studies were carried out to determine whether the combined use of RA, DMSO and azadCyd could reverse the resistance of these tumor cells to the induction of maturation expressed by the individual agents. When these agents were given in any combination of 2, a minor increase in differentiation induction was detected (13 +/- 6% or less NBT-positive cells). However, when all 3 agents were combined (RA + DMSO + azaCyd), resistance was completely reversed (89 +/- 7% mature NBT-positive cells). In addition, different degrees of concentration-dependence of each agent in the combination were observed. The RA + DMSO + azadCyd combination caused a maximal accumulation of NBT-positive cells after 72 to 96 hr of incubation.

The addition of folic acid (PteGlu) or 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-CHO-H4PteGlu) in the form of Leucovorin normalizes this effect. The reactions for measuring PRPP levels are time and temperature dependent and are influenced by PRPP-reacting substances in undialyzed serum. Inorganic phosphate (PO4), when added to the assay, markedly stimulates PRPP levels in HL-60 cells and can be used to stress folate-dependent PRPP utilization for purine synthesis. The integrity of the folate-dependent pathways of purine-synthesizing cells can be sensitively assessed by measurement of PRPP levels during a 2-hr assay in the presence of PO4 in medium free of folate but containing dialyzed serum. In HL-60 cells that are folate deficient or in the presence of MTX (as low as 2 X 10(-9) M), PO4-stimulated PRPP levels remain elevated due to ineffective utilization unless folate is added to the incubation mixture. The sensitivity of this PRPP assay to metabolically assess the integrity of folate-dependent reactions in purine synthesis is comparable to that of the deoxyuridine suppression assay. Inorganic phosphate can also be used to stimulate the incorporation of purine analogs, such as 6-mercaptopurine, into intact red blood cells which may have therapeutic implications for targeting drug delivery.","['Ghitis, J', 'Schreiber, C', 'Waxman, S']","['Ghitis J', 'Schreiber C', 'Waxman S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Human neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity.,1624-30,"Histamine release occurs during the late phase allergic reaction concomitantly with neutrophil (PMN) infiltration. To determine whether PMN might release a factor capable of causing histamine release, supernatants generated by incubating human PMN in the presence or absence of specific activators were added to rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL) and histamine release was measured. PMN supernatants from 17 of 21 donors induced noncytotoxic histamine release. Neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity, termed HRA-N, was dose-dependent and supernatants from greater than or equal to 10(7) PMN/ml caused 6 to 27% net histamine release from RBL. PMN supernatants induced histamine release as effectively as did intact PMN cocultured with RBL. The capacity of various donors to generate HRA-N was not related to atopic status or gender but was inversely related to the proportion of eosinophils (EOS) contaminating the PMN isolate (the larger the proportion of EOS, the lower the histamine release). Addition of EOS to PMN during the generation of HRA-N completely inhibited histamine-releasing activity. HRA-N was not released from mononuclear cells or platelets contaminating the PMN preparation. HRA-N release was not increased by the presence of either serum-treated zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate, agents that caused dose-related release of PMN granule enzymes. Indeed, HRA-N was released from unstimulated PMN in the complete absence of granule enzyme release. HRA-N release was detectable by 15 min and the majority of release occurred between 45 and 60 min of incubation. Thus, the data indicate that HRA-N is released spontaneously from human PMN and that HRA-N release is independent of primary or secondary PMN granule release. It is attractive to suggest that release of HRA-N by PMN might act to recruit mast cells or basophils into participating in acute inflammatory reactions.","['White, M V', 'Kaliner, M A']","['White MV', 'Kaliner MA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', '*Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Sep 1;139(5):1624-30.,['1 F25 A107507-01/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

In this paper we show that antibodies belonging to this cluster recognize an antigen present on a large subset of peripheral T lymphocytes and most medullary thymocytes. At least two different nonoverlapping epitopes were identified with directly labeled monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that the target antigen of CD27 antibodies is a polypeptide of 55 kDa, which appears in the form of a disulfide-linked homodimer on the T lymphocyte membrane (Tp55). Stimulation of T cells via the T3/T cell antigen-receptor complex, with either phytohemagglutinin or CD3 monoclonal antibodies, resulted in a fivefold increase in the membrane expression of Tp55, whereas activation by phorbol myristate acetate caused a marked down-regulation. Moreover, an additional molecule of 32 kDa was precipitated from the membrane of activated but not of resting T cells. Addition of CD27 antibodies to cultures stimulated with either phytohemagglutinin or CD3 monoclonal antibody led to enhanced proliferation, whereas no effect was observed in phorbol myristate acetate or interleukin 2-stimulated cultures.

The increase of this voltage-activated current in differentiation toward the macrophage, but not the granulocyte, suggests that this current is correlated specifically with macrophage differentiation.","['Wieland, S J', 'Chou, R H', 'Chen, T A']","['Wieland SJ', 'Chou RH', 'Chen TA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '1KSV9V4Y4I (Cesium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cesium/pharmacology', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041320227 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 Aug;132(2):371-5. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041320227.,['5507 RR50413/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Compared to human resting T-lymphocytes, all T- and B-cell lines tested exhibited positive staining for fluoresceinated AFP and transferrin (Tf) and a significant increase, up to 100-fold, of the number of AFP and Tf molecules endocytosed per cell. Labelling was prevented or strongly diminished by a 100-fold excess of unlabelled protein. Preliminary results with peripheral lymphoid cells harvested from leukemia patients showed the presence of AFP- and Tf-positive cells in the blood of all patients examined. Intensity of labelling was related to the type of leukemia cells and/or the degree of cell maturation. Most cell lines exhibited positive staining for alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) and also, to a lesser extent, for serum Vitamin D3 binding protein (DBP). In contrast, no labelling was observed with FITC-serum albumin (FITC-Alb) or FITC-ovalbumin (FITC-OVA).

To probe the possible contribution of inhibition of angiogenesis, we have assessed angiogenesis in the mouse initiated by either human or murine tumor cell lines. Whether test cells were inoculated in the dermis or tumor fragments were grafted onto the cornea, tumor-induced angiogenesis (TIA) was inhibited by IFNs. TIA was also inhibited by the potent IFN inducer polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid. The effect of IFN was species specific; human IFNs inhibited human tumors and mouse IFNs inhibited murine tumors. This effect suggested that in contrast to other angiogenesis inhibitors, IFNs modulated the signal for angiogenesis produced by the tumor cells. Tumor cells treated in vitro with homologous IFN were significantly (P less than 0.005) less competent to initiate angiogenesis than were untreated cells. Inhibition of angiogenesis was achieved whether vascular response was assessed 1 or 3 days after tumor cell inoculation, suggesting that antiangiogenesis activity was independent of the antiproliferative effects of IFNs. To further substantiate this, L1210 leukemia cells, resistant to the antiproliferative effects of IFNs, were treated with 500 units/ml IFN-beta. IFN had no effect on their proliferation, but in four separate experiments, L1210R cells were impaired in their ability to induce angiogenesis. Thus, inhibition of TIA by IFNs was species specific, occurred at least partly by modulation of the signal inducing angiogenesis, and was expressed in the absence of antiproliferative effects. IFNs also inhibited immunologically induced angiogenesis, whether initiated by allogeneic lymphocytes (LIA) or by the mouse's own T-cells in response to an exogenous antigen (sheep RBC). LIA was markedly suppressed by treatment of host mice with homologous IFN-beta. For example, mean vessel counts induced by allogeneic mouse lymphocytes were decreased from 22.8 +/- 1.4 (SE) to 12.5 +/- 0.8 (P less than 0.0001); mouse IFN-beta had no corresponding effect on xenogeneic human lymphocytes (mean vessel counts decreased to 21.7 +/- 2.6 from 22.7 +/- 2.0). Treatment with human IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma in vitro or host mice in vivo reduced the ability of inoculated human peripheral blood lymphocytes to initiate xenogeneic LIA. Inhibition of LIA required a lower dose and/or a shorter incubation period than that needed to modulate TIA. Treatment of the donor of the allogeneic spleen cells in vivo with murine IFN or inducers also resulted in lesser LIA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Sidky, Y A', 'Borden, E C']","['Sidky YA', 'Borden EC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cornea', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*blood supply', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*prevention & control', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Skin/blood supply']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Oct 1;47(19):5155-61.,"['CA-14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

One method to achieve this goal is amplification of globin genes transferred into the stem cells in the bone marrow of these patients. If the amplified genes remain normally regulated, they will then further increase their expression on being induced to differentiate along an erythroid pathway. To begin this study, we constructed a plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene, a human beta globin gene, and a wild-type DHFR cDNA, and transfected it into mouse erythroleukemia cells. All the G418-resistant clones analyzed acquired and expressed the human beta globin gene. By serial passage of the cells in increasing concentrations of methotrexate, the exogenous human beta globin genes were stably amplified in all lines, and all increased their globin mRNA expression roughly proportional to their augmented copy number. Most of the clones further increased their beta globin expression on addition of an erythroid stimulus (dimethylsulfoxide). These results indicate that globin gene amplification may be useful in increasing globin mRNA expression in further experiments whose goal is gene therapy.","['Rund, D', 'Dobkin, C', 'Bank, A']","['Rund D', 'Dobkin C', 'Bank A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Clone Cells', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78660-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Sep;70(3):733-9.,"['AM-25274/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-28381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-37069/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

We have identified mutants of vaccinia virus from untreated and interferon (IFN)-treated persistently infected Friend erythroleukemia (FEL) cells that have major alterations in the size of a virus structural protein. This protein is part of the virus envelope as documented with specific monoclonal antibody (mAbC3). This protein, under reducing conditions, has a molecular weight of about 14,000 (14K) Da in wild-type virus but gained 1.5 K in mutants from untreated, persistently infected cells and about 0.5 K in mutants from IFN-treated persistently infected cells. Under nonreducing conditions, this protein forms covalently linked oligomers which also differ in size between wild-type and mutant viruses. The 14K protein elicits humoral immune response as assessed by immunoblots of two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis using rabbit anti-vaccinia serum. Two molecular forms of the 14K protein with different isoelectric points were found only in mutants from untreated, persistently infected cells. Protein modifications were the result of DNA sequence alterations in the virus population since the 15.5 K protein could be reverted to 14K after marker-rescue with the cloned 14K encoding gene. We provide direct evidence that changes in size of the 14K envelope protein are responsible for the small plaque size phenotype of these variants. From our previous studies (J. F. Rodriguez, R. Janeczko, and M. Esteban, 1985, J. Virol. 56, 352-356; J. F. Rodriguez, E. Paez, and M. Esteban, 1987, J. Virol. 61, 395-404) and those described here, we established that the 14K protein plays an important role in virus-host cell interactions. This is because this protein is part of the virus envelope, is highly antigenic, elicits neutralizing antibodies, has a role in virus penetration acting in cell fusion, is involved in the virus plaque size phenotype and is highly conserved among Orthopoxviruses. In addition, because mutants with altered 14K protein that have gained 1.5K in size are attenuated (S. Dallo and M. Esteban, 1987, Virology 159, 408-422), it suggests that a modified form of this protein contributes to the decrease of the virulence of vaccinia virus.","['Dallo, S', 'Rodriguez, J F', 'Esteban, M']","['Dallo S', 'Rodriguez JF', 'Esteban M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phenotype', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Viral Plaque Assay']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(87)90481-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1987 Aug;159(2):423-32. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(87)90481-8.,['CA 44262-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Candidates for bivalent ligands exhibiting negative co-operativity (caused probably by steric hindrance) are certain anti-immunoglobulin antibodies. We show how to calculate the amount of ligand bound, the fraction of antibody in cross-links (i.e. in ligand-antibody aggregates) and the fraction of antibody in any size ligand-antibody aggregate. With sample calculations it is demonstrated that there can be major differences in the binding and cross-linking properties of co-operative and non-co-operative bivalent ligands.

The antigen, My23, is released from these cells in culture and is also detectable in normal human plasma. We have now raised a panel of MoAbs against the soluble form of the antigen which reacts with monocytes and calcitriol-treated U937 and HL-60 myeloid cell lines, but not with lymphocytes or undifferentiated U937 and HL-60 cells. As with the AML-2-23 MoAb, the anti-My23 MoAbs immunoprecipitated a 50,000-55,000 protein from calcitriol treated HL-60 cells. Besides binding to cell surface My23, all eight MoAbs as well as the 63D3 MoAb reacted with crude and purified forms of soluble My23. A novel ELISA epitope analysis assay was developed to identify four distinct antigenic determinants on My23. Thus, the soluble and cell surface forms of My23 share several antigenic determinants and are biochemically very similar. Pooled anti-My23 caused selective patching, capping and clearing of My23 from the cell surface. My23 was not associated with cell surface, HLA-DR, HLA-A,B,C, beta 2-microglobulin or the Fc receptors for IgG or IgA. These anti-My23 MoAbs should be of importance in antigen functional studies and in clinical treatment protocols for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.

We have previously shown that M-MuLV infection of mouse fibroblasts results in a substantial increase in cell surface expression of H-2K, H-2D, and H-2L proteins, whereas M-MSV, upon coinfection of the same cells, is apparently able to override the MuLV-induced increase in H-2 expression. As a result of this modulation, immune recognition of the infected cells is profoundly altered. Our efforts have been directed toward elucidating the molecular basis for this phenomenon. We report here that stimulation of interferon production as a result of infection with MuLV does not occur and, therefore, is not the cause of MuLV-induced enhancement of MHC expression. Control of H-2 class I and beta 2-microglobulin gene expression by M-MuLV, and probably by M-MSV, takes place at the transcriptional level as indicated by nuclear runoff studies and analysis of steady-state mRNA levels. Our demonstration that M-MuLV controls expression of widely separated endogenous cellular genes (those coding for H-2D, H-2K, H-2L, and beta 2-microglobulin), transfected class I MHC genes, and unintegrated chimeric genes consisting of fragments of class I MHC genes linked to sequences encoding a procaryotic enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, suggests that M-MuLV exerts its effect in trans and not by proviral integration in the vicinity of the H-2 gene complex. Finally, we show that the sequences of at least one MHC gene, which are responsive to trans regulation by M-MuLV, lie within 1.2 kilobases upstream of the initiation codon for that gene.","['Wilson, L D', 'Flyer, D C', 'Faller, D V']","['Wilson LD', 'Flyer DC', 'Faller DV']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Interferons/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.7.7.2406-2415.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Jul;7(7):2406-15. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.7.2406-2415.1987.,"['CA 07808-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC365372,,,,,,

The rearrangements are due to insertion of a deleted Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) provirus in the 5' region of the c-myb gene and thus are similar to rearrangements in the ABPL tumors (G. L. C. Shen-Ong, M. Potter, J. F. Mushinski, S. Lavu, and E. P. Reddy, Science 226:1077-1080, 1984). In each cell line, the retroviral insertion has induced high levels of two aberrant RNA species, which, as in the ABPL tumors (G. L. C. Shen-Ong, H. C. Morse, M. Potter, and J. F. Mushinski, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:380-392, 1986), contain both viral (Mo-MLV) and cellular (myb) sequences. Both species lack the sequences encoding the amino terminus of the c-myb protein and thus could encode a protein which, like the v-myb gene products (and the predicted ABPL myb proteins), is truncated at the amino terminus. We have found that the larger (5.3 kilobase [kb]) and more abundant of the tumor-specific myb RNAs was predominantly nuclear, while the smaller species (3.9 kb) was cytoplasmic. Furthermore, our data imply that the 3.9-kb RNA was derived from the 5.3-kb RNA by an additional splice which utilized a cryptic splice acceptor site within the viral gag sequences. On the basis of subcellular distribution and predicted translational potential, we conclude that the 3.9-kb RNA is probably the mRNA which encodes a truncated myb protein. We also show that, due to different insertion points in W265 and W274, the W274 myb RNAs contained sequences from a c-myb exon upstream of the exons represented in the W265 (and ABPL) RNAs. The significance of our findings with regard to transformation by myb in these tumors is discussed.","['Gonda, T J', 'Cory, S', 'Sobieszczuk, P', 'Holtzman, D', 'Adams, J M']","['Gonda TJ', 'Cory S', 'Sobieszczuk P', 'Holtzman D', 'Adams JM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA Splicing', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.61.9.2754-2763.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Sep;61(9):2754-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.9.2754-2763.1987.,['CA-12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC255783,,,,,,

Those most closely related to bisantrene were less active than it was, but a subset of compounds with saturated side chains containing two basic nitrogens showed good activity. Two compounds of this subset, N,N'-bis[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-9,10-anthracenebis(methylamine)(6 ), and N,N'-bis(1-ethyl-3-piperidinyl)-9,10-anthracenebis(methylamine)(19 ), were very active in vitro against human tumor cell lines, but not active against fresh human tumors or P-388 leukemia cells. They had only marginal activity in mouse tumor models. Thus, the fresh human tumors and P-388 leukemia cells in vitro were better predictors than the established cell lines for the activity of these anthracene compounds in vivo against mouse tumors. These compounds appear to be distinct from bisantrene in aspects of mode of action. For example, 6 did not cause inhibition of macromolecular synthesis and promotion of DNA single strand breakage at cytotoxic drug concentrations.

Multiple effects of the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone.,10638-43,"The proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) inhibited antigen-stimulated secretion and calcium influx in rat basophilic leukemia cells. In a glucose-free solution the inhibitory effects of CCCP were due to a decrease in the intracellular ATP concentration; however, when glucose was present there was no decrease in ATP. Instead, we found that in a glucose-containing saline solution, CCCP inhibited antigen-stimulated calcium uptake because it depolarized the plasma membrane, which in rat basophilic leukemia cells inhibits antigen-stimulated calcium uptake. In the presence of glucose, relatively low concentrations of CCCP inhibited calcium uptake while higher concentrations were required to inhibit secretion. In contrast, the initial antigen-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic calcium, measured with the fluorescent calcium indicator quin2, was not inhibited by CCCP. This suggests that the release of calcium from intracellular stores might, in some cases, be sufficient to support antigen-stimulated secretion. In the presence of CCCP the pH gradient becomes important for regulating the membrane potential across the plasma membrane. When cells were depolarized with CCCP and the external pH was increased, the membrane potential returned to resting levels and antigen-stimulated calcium uptake was restored. Inhibition of antigen-stimulated secretion by higher concentrations of CCCP could also be reversed by increasing the external pH.","['Mohr, F C', 'Fewtrell, C']","['Mohr FC', 'Fewtrell C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Calcium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (gamma-Globulins)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Radioisotopes', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism', 'gamma-Globulins/immunology']",1987/08/05 00:00,1987/08/05 00:01,['1987/08/05 00:00'],"['1987/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)61011-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Aug 5;262(22):10638-43.,['AI 19910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Cell cycle analysis revealed a low percentage of cells in S and G2/M phase both in control and TPA-treated cultures of chronic B cell leukemias, while in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells TPA caused a large increase of S and G2/M cells. Both in chronic B cell leukemias and in PBMC, TPA induced an increase of RNA staining and neutral esterase activity in all or most cultures.

Of equal importance and greater interest, however, has been the recognition that super physiological doses of IgG can manipulate an abnormal immune system. Future prospects for the use of immunoglobulin preparations to supply specific antibodies includes the standardization of procedures, whereby patients with acute sepsis may receive antibiotics and immunoglobulin simultaneously. Already there is in vitro evidence that suggests that opsonized bacteria are more readily affected by aminoglycosides. It seems certain that gamma globulin will be used routinely in the management of patients with a number of immunomalignancies, such as chronic lymphatic leukaemia and multiple myeloma that feature hypogammaglobulinaemia, especially when chemotherapy is being administered. Control trials are underway to determine whether gamma globulin given intravenously to premature babies will satisfactorily correct their immuno-deficient state and improve their chances of survival. The immunomanipulative capacity of immunoglobulin is yet to be fully realized. Success in ideopathic thrombocytopenic purpura had led to a trial of gamma globulin in a number of autoimmune conditions. Success has been reported in myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, patients with circulating antibodies to factor VIII and Kawasaki's disease. The mechanism of action is unknown but almost certainly multifactorial. Two proven mechanisms that will be added to in the future, include blockade of the Fc receptors on cells of the reticulo-endothelial system and manipulation of immunoregulatory T cells by the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies in the preparation.","['Dwyer, J M']",['Dwyer JM'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Dev Biol Stand,Developments in biological standardization,0427140,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (gamma-Globulins)']",IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin G/administration & dosage', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*therapy', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'gamma-Globulins/*administration & dosage']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dev Biol Stand. 1987;67:281-7.,,,,,,,,

By this method, three heterozygous females gave results consistent with monoclonal origin of the disease, including one patient lacking the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) normally associated with CML.

The superior compounds in this regard were also found to exhibit excellent activity against primary human tumors in stem cell clonogenic assays. In addition, many of the compounds tested were found to be selectively cytotoxic to hypoxic relative to oxic HCT-8 colon adenocarcinoma cells, a property that may be a consequence of the potentially reducible 5-nitro function.

TALLA was determined to be a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular weight of 150,000. However, the molecular nature of TALLA is peculiar in that heating at 100 degrees C for 2 min renders TALLA undetectable in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It should be noted that such heating is a common practice before analysis of proteins and glycoproteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No significant antigenic modulation of TALLA was observed when T ALL cells were reacted with SN1. Two new monoclonal antibodies, SN1a and SN1b, which show the same cell binding specificity as SN1 were also generated in the present work and compared to SN1. Competitive binding experiments showed that the epitopes on TALLA recognized by SN1, SN1a, and SN1b are sufficiently close to one another to allow complete reciprocal inhibition of antibody binding.

The CEM/MTX cells were found previously to be as sensitive as the parent line to TBM. While MTX was polyglutamylated extensively in the CEM cells, giving abundant levels of non-effluxing conjugates, polyglutamylation in CEM/MTX cells was reduced severely, even after exposure to a high MTX concentration (100 microM) in the medium. This treatment provided free intracellular MTX in greater than 100-fold excess over the dihydrofolate reductase level. In contrast to MTX, the ester TBM was unmetabolized in either cell line. Uptake levels after incubation of CEM and CEM/MTX cells with 2 microM TBM for 24 hr were 17 and 15 pmol/mg protein respectively. Thus, TBM accumulated equally in both cells and was well retained despite the lack of polyglutamylation. These results, together with the previously observed affinity of the drug for dihydrofolate reductase, provide a plausible rationale for the comparable sensitivity of CEM and CEM/MTX cells to TBM. Experiments were also performed to determine the susceptibility of TBM to metabolic detoxification by hepatic aldehyde oxidase. Km values were 8-fold lower for TBM than for MTX in assays using an enzyme preparation from rabbit liver, and Vmax values were 8-fold higher. Neither MTX nor TBM was oxidized to its 7-hydroxy derivative in intact CEM or CEM/MTX cells. Because TBM is capable of overcoming at least one of the modalities of MTX resistance, defective polyglutamylation, and may be more efficiently detoxified than MTX by the action of hepatic aldehyde oxidase, it has the potential to be a useful agent for the treatment of MTX-resistant tumors.","['Wright, J E', 'Rosowsky, A', 'Waxman, D J', 'Trites, D', 'Cucchi, C A', 'Flatow, J', 'Frei, E 3rd']","['Wright JE', 'Rosowsky A', 'Waxman DJ', 'Trites D', 'Cucchi CA', 'Flatow J', 'Frei E 3rd']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '79640-76-9 (gamma-tert-butyl methotrexate)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 1.2.- (Aldehyde Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.2.3.1 (Aldehyde Oxidase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Oxidase', 'Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(87)90152-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90152-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1987 Jul 1;36(13):2209-14. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(87)90152-3.,,,,,,,,

Such effective internalization of alpha-2-M:antigen conjugate by macrophages resulted in a remarkable increase in its ability to activate murine immune T cells under the following conditions. After macrophages were incubated with alpha-2-M:antigen conjugate or unconjugated antigen, they were cultured with immune T cells and antigen-stimulated tritiated thymidine incorporation by T cells was measured. The stimulation of T cell proliferative response by macrophages fed with the conjugate was sixteen times higher than what was observed with macrophages pretreated in the same concentration of unconjugated antigen.

When the blood monocytes were co-cultured with K562 cells for 3-24 h, the supernatants contained soluble factors, termed monocyte cytotoxic factors (MCF), capable of lysing K562 and other tumor cells in a 48-h microcytotoxicity assay. The production of MCF was mediated by typical monocytes expressing a surface phenotype of CD11 (+), CD16 (-), LeuM1 (+). When target cells were pretreated with actinomycin D, they showed an increase in their susceptibility to lysis by MCF. Addition of the drug to MCF assays also resulted in an enhancement of MCF-mediated lysis. Thus, the lytic activity of MCF was detectable in an 18-h assay. The presence of interferon (IFN)-alpha or -gamma augmented the biological activity of MCF, while pretreatment of target cells with IFN did not enhance MCF activity. The absorption of MCF activity was not elevated by actinomycin D or IFN. MCF lysed target cells that were resistant to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). One result of importance is that MCF lysed autologous and allogeneic freshly isolated human tumor cells. The lysis of fresh human tumor cells by MCF was not inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF, lymphotoxin (LT), IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, or interleukin 1 (IL-1). Furthermore, TNF, LT, IFNs, and IL-1 did not kill fresh human tumor cells. MCF activity was stable at low temperatures but was destroyed by heating. The biological activity of MCF was reduced or abolished by serum, trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K, indicating the proteinaceous nature of MCF. The lytic activity was resistant to protease inhibitors. These data indicate that MCF is a noble cytokine that acts on human fresh tumor cells.","['Uchida, A']",['Uchida A'],,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Previous studies have shown that a murine T-cell hybrid (B151K12) produces factor(s) that (i) induce immunoglobulin secretion by the B-cell leukemia line BCL1 and secondary anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgG synthesis in vitro by dinitrophenyl-primed B cells (TRF activity) and (ii) cause proliferation of the BCL1 cells [B-cell growth factor II (BCGF-II) activity]. Both activities appear to be associated with the same molecule. Here we report the production of a monoclonal antibody to murine TRF. The monoclonal antibody, designated TB13, strongly inhibited both TRF and BCGF-II activities and absorbed TRF- as well as BCGF-II-active molecules produced by B151K12 and by Xenopus oocytes that had been injected with mRNA transcribed from plasmid pSP6K-mTRF23. Inhibition was linearly dependent on the concentration of both TB13 and TRF. Monoclonal antibody TB13 did not inhibit the activities of B-cell stimulatory factor 1, interleukin 1, interleukin 2, or interleukin 3. TRF activity in dissolved samples of immunoprecipitates obtained with TB13 was recovered after NaDodSO4/PAGE, in the fractions corresponding to a protein band at Mr 46,000.

Protooncogene expression was also examined in uncultured human myeloid leukemia cells. While c-src transcripts were detected in myeloid leukemia cells representative of all stages of differentiation, the highly related gene c-fgr was expressed at high levels only at later developmental stages, both in normal cells committed to the monocytic lineage and in leukemic cells with a differentiated myelomonocytic phenotype. When bone marrow-derived monocytic cells were synchronized and stimulated to proliferate with CSF-1, c-fgr transcripts (but not transcripts from the highly related genes c-src or c-yes) were induced 8 hr after the addition of CSF-1 and decreased to low levels by 20 hr as the monocytic cells entered S phase.

On the other hand, only one-third of the mature ovalbumin mRNA of whole nuclei was recovered in the nuclear matrix fraction. The binding of both the high molecular weight mRNA precursors and the mature-sized mRNA to the matrix displayed no difference in stability against salt, urea, or detergents. The mature mRNA, however, was found to be released selectively from the matrix by ATP. In contrast, the mRNA precursors remained completely bound to the nuclear substructure in the presence of ATP. Detachment of mRNA from the matrix also occurred in the presence of ADP, AMP plus pyrophosphate, or ATP analogs that contain nonhydrolyzable alpha, beta and beta, gamma bonds. Contrasting with the ATP-induced effect, addition of poly(A), ethidium bromide, or the copper chelator 1,10-phenanthroline to oviduct cell matrices caused an unspecific liberation of both mature and immature ovalbumin messengers. The release of the mature mRNA by ATP was found to be strongly inhibited by both nonintercalative and intercalative inhibitors of type II topoisomerase. These results suggest that the selection of the mature mRNAs for nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs at the release stage from the matrix (i.e. before translocation through the nuclear pore) and that reactions hitherto known to cause changes in the DNA secondary structure are associated with the detachment of mRNA from the nuclear substructure.","['Schroder, H C', 'Trolltsch, D', 'Friese, U', 'Bachmann, M', 'Muller, W E']","['Schroder HC', 'Trolltsch D', 'Friese U', 'Bachmann M', 'Muller WE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ovalbumin/genetics', 'Oviducts/*metabolism', 'RNA/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",1987/06/25 00:00,1987/06/25 00:01,['1987/06/25 00:00'],"['1987/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)47502-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Jun 25;262(18):8917-25.,,,,,,,,

Pulse-chase experiments with [3H]leucine showed that the env precursor, gPr80env, was inefficiently processed in cells treated with CB. In the presence of monensin, an inhibitor of glycoprotein transport, gPr80env accumulated intracellularly and no gp70 was observed on the cell surface, indicating a complete block in the processing of gPr80env. Pulse-chase studies also showed that gPr80env was not processed in the presence of monensin. SDS-PAGE analysis of TX-100-extracted cell cytoskeletons (TX-insoluble fraction) iodinated and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-gp70 antiserum showed that CB or monensin treatment caused a marked increase of gPr80env in the cytoskeleton-rich fraction. However, the amount of gPr80env associated with the TX-soluble fraction in both CB or monensin-treated and untreated cells labeled with [3H]leucine was about the same. The gPr80env in the TX-100-soluble fraction of the cell was the endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) sensitive mannose-rich form, whereas the cytoskeleton-associated gPr80env was the partially Endo-H-resistant complex carbohydrate form. In the presence of CB or monensin, the complex carbohydrate form of gPr80env accumulated in the cytoskeleton-rich cell fraction. Examination of Mo-MuLV ts1 mutant, which is defective in the processing of env precursor polyprotein, also revealed an accumulation of the complex carbohydrate form of gPr80env in the cytoskeleton-rich fraction and an absence of gp70 on the surface of the cell at the restrictive temperature (39 degrees C). These studies suggest that the cytoskeleton plays a role in the transport and processing of MuLV gPr80env and that oligosaccharide conversion is an important factor in this process. Further, the accumulation of gPr80env on the cytoskeleton of ts1 infected cells at restrictive temperature may play a role in the neurological disorder caused by Mo-MuLV ts1 mutant.","['Soong, M M', 'Tompkins, W A']","['Soong MM', 'Tompkins WA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/*genetics/physiology', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Temperature', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4800(87)90051-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4800(87)90051-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 1987 Jun;46(3):294-311. doi: 10.1016/0014-4800(87)90051-7.,['CA09067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Adriamycin interacts with the plasma membrane, a phenomenon which may lead to a direct modulation of Ca2+ transport proteins or, since the drug is a quinone, may lead to indirect changes in Ca2+ homeostasis induced by oxidative stress to the cell. The calcium content of L1210 murine leukemia cells treated with adriamycin for up to 6 hr was estimated using the cell-impermeant dye arsenazo-III. Pools of intracellular Ca2+ were released to the extracellular compartment, where they reacted with the dye by sequential treatment of the cells with m-fluorocarbonylcyanidediphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and the Ca2+-ionophore A23187. Pretreatment of L1210 cells with ruthenium red (5 microM) selectively decreased the FCCP-releasable Ca2+ pool, which suggested it was mitochondrial in origin. Continuous exposure of L1210 murine leukemia cells in vitro to 5 or 10 microM adriamycin for 2 hr did not produce any change in the intracellular concentration of releasable Ca2+; at 4 hr, however, the total releasable pool of Ca2+ rose by 29% and 46% for 5 and 10 microM adriamycin respectively. This increase was seen predominantly in the mitochondrial pool. Exposure of L1210 cells to the quinone, menadione, also increased the releasable pools of cellular Ca2+ but like adriamycin, only after an incubation period of 4 hr. These results contrasted with a rapid decrease in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration produced by a short (5 min) exposure to 500 microM t-butylhydroperoxide, a generator of free radicals. After treatment with 8 mM lidocaine, a membrane fluidizing agent, there was a rapid fall in extramitochondrial Ca2+. These findings suggest that changes in L1210 Ca2+ homeostasis induced by adriamycin and menadione are late, and possibly common, events of quinone toxicity to L1210 cells, adriamycin does not have an immediate effect on Ca2+ ion transport produced by the direct interaction of the antibiotic with the plasma membrane, and oxidative stress induced by redox-active quinones may not be important for the induction of toxicity in neoplastic cells.","['Keyes, S R', 'Hickman, J A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Keyes SR', 'Hickman JA', 'Sartorelli AC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['0 (Peroxides)', '11103-72-3 (Ruthenium Red)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)', '98PI200987 (Lidocaine)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Lidocaine/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Peroxides/pharmacology', 'Ruthenium Red/pharmacology', 'Vitamin K/pharmacology', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90073-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1987 Mar;23(3):295-302. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(87)90073-3.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

They correspond respectively to the metaphase NORs and to numerous structures which appear de novo within ribonucleoprotein (RNP) material localized between the chromosomes. During late telophase the number of the small silver-staining structures decreases whereas the size of the larger ones increases. Then the interphase nucleoli recover their typical shape. These results suggest that when rRNA synthesis is impaired during mitosis the inactive NORs assume a structure and a localization which are not typical of the cell line. In contrast the F.C. and D.F.C. are probably two aspects of the NORs whose typical distribution, relative to the other nucleolar components, gives the interphasic nucleolus its characteristic morphology.","['Ploton, D', 'Thiry, M', 'Menager, M', 'Lepoint, A', 'Adnet, J J', 'Goessens, G']","['Ploton D', 'Thiry M', 'Menager M', 'Lepoint A', 'Adnet JJ', 'Goessens G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Chromosoma,Chromosoma,2985138R,['0 (Chromatin)'],IM,"['Anaphase', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/*ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Mitosis', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*ultrastructure', 'Staining and Labeling']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00332182 [doi]'],ppublish,Chromosoma. 1987;95(2):95-107. doi: 10.1007/BF00332182.,,,,,,,,

Four hours after injection, tumor cells were removed from the ascites fluid and analyzed for protein B23 translocation using an immunofluorescence technique. Bright nucleolar fluorescence was observed in untreated cells. Treatment with actinomycin D (1.25 mg/kg), doxorubicin (25 mg/kg), or daunorubicin (12.5 mg/kg) produced a uniform nucleoplasmic fluorescence. This change in immunofluorescence distribution indicated that protein B23 translocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm after drug treatment. These results are an extension of previous studies with HeLa cells (Yung et al., Cancer Res. 46: 922-925, 1986). Doxorubicin-resistant and -sensitive mouse leukemia cells (P388) were cultured in medium containing various doses of doxorubicin for 4 h, and the responsive levels of the cells to doxorubicin were compared. At 50 micrograms/ml doxorubicin, 86% of the doxorubicin-sensitive cells showed uniform nucleoplasmic fluorescence, and less than 2% of the cells retained nucleolar fluorescence. At this same dose, only 9% of the resistant cells showed nucleoplasmic fluorescence, and 75% of the cells retained nucleolar fluorescence. At 100 micrograms/ml, about 26% of the resistant cells showed translocation, in contrast to 100% of the sensitive cells that showed B23 translocation. About 57% of the resistant cells showed an intermediate effect, and about 17% of the resistant cells maintained bright nucleolar fluorescence at this dose. The resistant cells also showed less responsiveness to actinomycin D. These results suggest that identification of ""B23 translocation"" may be used to detect drug-resistant cells and to study the efficacy of certain antitumor agents.","['Chan, P K', 'Aldrich, M B', 'Yung, B Y']","['Chan PK', 'Aldrich MB', 'Yung BY']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dactinomycin/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleophosmin', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism']",1987/07/15 00:00,1987/07/15 00:01,['1987/07/15 00:00'],"['1987/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jul 15;47(14):3798-801.,"['CA 10893-P9/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

In each case, the leukemic transformation had morphologic features suggesting megakaryocytic differentiation. This was confirmed by positive immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody (HP1-1D) specific for platelet and megakaryocyte glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antigen, which was expressed by the majority of the leukemic blasts in all three cases. Cases with evidence of multilineage differentiation of the leukemic transformation were excluded. A striking feature in two patients was the manifestation of lytic bone lesions and soft tissue masses at presentation. A biopsy of a lytic bone lesion and soft tissue mass in one patient revealed a megakaryoblastic leukemic infiltrate, which by immunocytochemical staining was positive for the megakaryocytic markers, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antigen, and Factor VIII (von Willebrand factor) antigen. In contrast to granulocytic sarcomas, the megakaryoblastic sarcoma did not stain cytochemically for chloroacetate esterase. The mean survival after acute transformation was 5.3 months.

Recently, we isolated a human recombinant multilineage CSF (hMulti-CSF). We investigated the ability of hMulti-CSF to stimulate AML clonogenic cells in seven patients in direct comparison with the effects of human granulocyte CSF (hG-CSF), human granulocyte-macrophage CSF (hGM-CSF), and feeder leukocytes. We show that hMulti-CSF is an efficient stimulator of AML colony formation in four of seven cases. In these patients, hGM-CSF was also capable of stimulating AML colonies in vitro. In two of seven cases hMulti-CSF appeared to be a weak stimulus of AML-CFU proliferation. In these latter two cases, however, hG-CSF and in one case hGM-CSF effectively stimulated AML-CFU growth. In one patient none of the hCSFs, either alone or in combination, induced AML colony formation, whereas AML colonies consistently appeared in the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) leukocyte feeder assay. This finding suggests that PHA stimulated leukocytes produce components other than the tested hCSFs that may have a role in the proliferation of AML cells in vitro. Multi-CSF, like hGM-CSF, revealed a limited capacity to induce progressive maturation during AML colony growth, ie, not beyond the promyelocytic stage. On the other hand, in one case, hG-CSF stimulated the growth of AML colonies containing (meta)myelocytes and granulocytes. We conclude that hMulti-CSF is a regulator of AML-CFU proliferation in a significant number of cases. The patterns of responsiveness of AML precursors to the three hCSFs in different patients show a striking variability, which may indicate that AML-CFU are the neoplastic representatives of normal bone marrow progenitors at different stages of maturation and with distinct CSF requirements.","['Delwel, R', 'Dorssers, L', 'Touw, I', 'Wagemaker, G', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Delwel R', 'Dorssers L', 'Touw I', 'Wagemaker G', 'Lowenberg B']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78519-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jul;70(1):333-6.,,,,,,,,

The autoantibodies promote complement fixation and clearance of immune complexes. They amplify the avidity of polyclonally induced IgG. Genes related to the primary structure of rheumatoid-factor light chains are widely distributed in the human population and have been conserved during the evolution and dispersion of the species. Products of these genes may be detected with anti-idiotypic antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to individual hypervariable regions on rheumatoid-factor light chains. Such anti-peptide antibodies provide unique reagents for analyzing the genetics of immunoglobulins in outbred populations. Precursors of rheumatoid factor are abundant among immature B lymphocytes. Some of these cells may tend to localize to mucosal surfaces, where they are stimulated directly by pathogenic microorganisms with polyclonal B cell-activating properties. Synthesis of rheumatoid factor regularly accompanies all secondary immune responses but is usually transient. Production of the autoantibody is T-cell dependent. The T cells may recognize antigen in an IgG-antigen immune complex that is processed and presented by B-cell precursors of rheumatoid factor. Rheumatoid factor-associated light-chain idiotypes are rare in serum IgG and on IgG myeloma proteins. They are common among monoclonal IgM proteins and on the surface of the malignant B cells from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia. The rheumatoid factors that are produced by patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia, or primary Sjogren's syndrome can share idiotypic antigens with monoclonal rheumatoid factors. Rheumatoid factor synthesis in the diseases may reflect an abnormal proliferation of B-cells that is not antigen-driven and that can degenerate into malignancy. The rheumatoid factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are diverse and almost certainly represent the outcome of antigen-induced, T cell-dependent mechanisms. The antigens that drive the T cells have not been identified but could represent exogenous microorganisms, self components, or idiotypic antigens that fortuitously interact with rheumatoid factors.","['Carson, D A', 'Chen, P P', 'Fox, R I', 'Kipps, T J', 'Jirik, F', 'Goldfien, R D', 'Silverman, G', 'Radoux, V', 'Fong, S']","['Carson DA', 'Chen PP', 'Fox RI', 'Kipps TJ', 'Jirik F', 'Goldfien RD', 'Silverman G', 'Radoux V', 'Fong S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Annu Rev Immunol,Annual review of immunology,8309206,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,"['Autoantibodies/physiology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immune System', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/immunology', 'Rheumatoid Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.iy.05.040187.000545 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Immunol. 1987;5:109-26. doi: 10.1146/annurev.iy.05.040187.000545.,"['AG04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AM25443/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM35218/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

However, despite the fact that the three types of human IFNs, leukocyte alpha-IFN, fibroblast beta-IFN and immune gamma-IFN, are available in large amounts through recombinant DNA technology, the practical applicability of IFN therapy in cancer is far from clear. An initial approach to this problem is to determine the mechanism of action of IFNs and, if they do not act, to find out why. There are various ways in which IFN may control tumours, i.e. anti-viral action, inhibition of cell growth, stimulation of cell differentiation, changes in cells modulating the susceptibility to immune rejection, or effects on the host immune systems (natural killer system and cytotoxic proteins). The implications of these data for the use of IFNs in cancer therapy then need to be evaluated. Both alpha- and beta-IFNs may have beneficial effects on growth inhibition and differentiation, but gamma-IFN is probably stronger in boosting the immune recognition and rejection of tumour cells. A combination of these two types of IFNs may give the best results in vivo since they often act synergistically in vitro. The sensitivity of individual tumour cells to the various types of IFN needs to be evaluated to select the best treatment by measuring oncogene mRNA inhibition, G0/G1 arrest and increase in various HLA antigens. Finally, the aim of any treatment (anti-viral action, tumour regression, prevention of metastasis, decreased tumour growth and increased cell differentiation) should be an important consideration in choosing IFN therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Boiron, M']",['Boiron M'],,['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Graft Rejection', 'Humans', 'Immunity/drug effects', 'Interferons/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Research']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1987;29(1):49-55.,,,,,Les interferons en hemato-cancerologie.,,,

Therefore, there is independent variation of the mAb AA4 epitope compared to the sites to which the other mAb and IgE bind.","['Stracke, M L', 'Basciano, L K', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Stracke ML', 'Basciano LK', 'Siraganian RP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Basophils', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', '*Histamine Release', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(87)90006-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(87)90006-x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1987 Apr;14(4):287-92. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(87)90006-x.,,,,,,,,

The IgE- or ionophore-mediated activation of rat basophilic leukaemia cells (RBL-2H3) was accompanied by the prominent phosphorylation of a 92,000 molecular weight (MW) cellular component. The degree of phosphorylation of this component correlated with the extent of histamine release from the cells. This phosphorylation was rapid, reaching a maximum 2-5 min following the addition of the ionophore or antigen, and decreasing to background by 30 min. In contrast, histamine release is a much slower process. Although the phosphorylation required the presence of Ca2+ in the medium, it was not inhibited by La3+, which blocks the stimulated entry of Ca2+. Therefore, the stimulation of a Ca2+-dependent kinase is an early event in the activation of the rat basophilic leukaemia cells.","['Hattori, Y', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Hattori Y', 'Siraganian RP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', '*Histamine Release', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1987 Apr;60(4):573-8.,,PMC1453272,,,,,,

A primer extension experiment indicated that the cDNA is at least 51 bp shorter than the mRNA at the 5' end. In normal human placenta as well as in fibroblasts from Gaucher's disease patients, a major mRNA species of 2.6 kb hybridizes with the cDNA probe. The amounts of the glucocerebrosidase mRNA in normal placenta and Gaucher's cells are comparable. The cDNA was linked to the SP6 promoter and transcribed in vitro. The resultant RNA, when translated in a cell-free system, yielded a polypeptide of 55 kD, which is the size expected from the coding sequence. The cDNA was inserted into an SV40 shuttle vector, under the transcription control of the SV40 early promoter. COS-M6 cells were transfected with this construct and the biological activity of the cDNA was assayed by monitoring the increase in glucocerebrosidase activity, using 4-methyl umbiliferyl glucopyranoside as a substrate.

Mice heterozygous for this allele have a yellow coat color, are genetically obese with an increased susceptibility to cancer, and have other metabolic derangements. Mice homozygous for Ay die early in embryogenesis, possibly because of a trophectoderm defect. The Ay mutation is distinguished from the many alleles described at the agouti locus in being associated with an endogenous provirus, designated endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia viral locus 15 (Emv-15). To obtain DNA sequences from regions close to or within the agouti locus, we have isolated the Emv-15 provirus and have found that the DNA sequences adjacent to the provirus are part of a mouse gene that is expressed in the same transcriptional orientation as the proviral genes. These mouse DNA sequences recognize two distinct size classes of RNA in various adult wild-type tissues including skin. In Ay heterozygotes both types of transcript hybridize to the proviral long terminal repeat, and, in heterozygous spleens, the shorter transcript is present at an enhanced steady-state level. These results suggest that the Ay-associated provirus (Emv-15) is distinguished from the endogenous C-type proviruses described to date in having altered the expression of a flanking host gene by promoter insertion, resulting in the production of chimeric viral-host fusion transcripts.","['Lovett, M', 'Epstein, C J']","['Lovett M', 'Epstein CJ']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', '*Genes, Lethal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'RNA/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.84.9.2853 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):2853-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.9.2853.,['HD-03132/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],PMC304758,,,,,,

Two such mutants, MLV-SF1, which bears a single missense mutation (L. A. Donehower and H. E. Varmus, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6461-6465, 1984), and MLV-SF2, which has a frameshift mutation at the same site, have been used to explore the consequences of integration deficiencies. Pseudotypes that were formed with viral proteins supplied by these mutants and a replication-defective genome that carried a selectable genetic marker induced colony formation at least 100-fold less efficiently than did pseudotypes that were formed with proteins encoded by wild-type helper virus. Most of the proviruses from the mutant pseudotypes were manifestly aberrant when they were analyzed by mapping with restriction enzymes. Rare proviruses that appeared to be normal by restriction enzyme mapping were molecularly cloned and subjected to more detailed study. Two proviruses resulting from infection with the MLV-SF1 pseudotype were identical or nearly identical to wild-type MI V proviruses. Two base pairs were missing from the ends of the long terminal repeats at the host-viral junctions, and 4- or 5-base-pair duplications of host DNA flanked the proviruses. Thus, the missense mutant appears to retain a low level of normal integration activity. Four proviruses from cells that were infected with the MLV-SF2 pseudotype were flanked on both sides by viral DNA of either helper or vector origin, with a single long terminal repeat at each end of the intact vector DNA and with irregular junctions of viral and host DNAs. These results are most simply explained by the nonspecific integration of dimeric or trimeric forms of viral DNA, which may arise during infection by replicative or recombinational mechanisms.","['Hagino-Yamagishi, K', 'Donehower, L A', 'Varmus, H E']","['Hagino-Yamagishi K', 'Donehower LA', 'Varmus HE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Helper Viruses/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Rats', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.61.6.1964-1971.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Jun;61(6):1964-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.6.1964-1971.1987.,,PMC254204,,,,,,

The activity of the leptomeningeal disease was classified as either acute-progressive, stable or in remission on the basis of clinical and CSF cytological findings. CSF MBP levels were analysed in each stage. Abnormal elevation of MBP was detected in 74% of the 68 samples obtained in the acute-progressive stage (mean +/- SEM: 18.25 +/- 1.4 ng/ml, P less than 0.0001), in 24% of the 79 samples in the stable phase (mean: 7.99 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, NS) and in 20% of the 30 samples in remission (mean 5.7 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, NS). Similar changes in levels of CSF MBP were also observed in longitudinal studies of patients responding to treatment or relapsing to the acute stage. Eight patients developed treatment induced necrotizing leukoencephalopathy with typical CT-scan findings; elevated levels of CSF MBP were detected in 7 of them (mean: 21 +/- 3 ng/ml) when measured within 2 weeks of diagnosis but not when measured 2 months earlier.

By use of monoclonal antibodies directed against various epitopes of the 155 kd alpha-chain of Mo1, two distinct functions of this glycoprotein have been identified. Mo1 serves as the receptor (CR3) for iC3b, one of the breakdown products of the third component of complement, and in addition appears to be involved in promoting cell-cell adhesion of granulocytes. In studies performed with a subline of the acute myelogenous leukemia tumor cell line KG1, we found cells from this subline (KG1m) incapable of iC3b-mediated binding despite these cells having surface Mo1. Five distinct epitopes on Mo1 identifiable on normal cells by a panel of anti-Mo1 alpha-chain monoclonal antibodies (including OKM10, thought to be identical to or close to the iC3b binding site) were equally present on KG1m by indirect immunofluorescence. The electrophoretic mobilities of both the alpha- and beta-chains of Mo1 derived from KG1m were identical to those isolated from normal granulocytes. To determine whether altered receptor mobility or decreased surface density of Mo1 was responsible for the lack of Mo1-related functions, binding to EiC3b of isolated Mo1 derived from KG1m lysate was measured. KG1m-derived Mo1 did not bind to EiC3b when compared with normal granulocyte-derived Mo1, suggesting that the lack of iC3b binding is not secondary to decreased surface receptor number or mobility.

However, mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Because cellular oncogenes play a pivotal role in regulating proliferation and differentiation, we examined whether cAMP-promoted differentiation of HL-60 was preceded by a decrease in the expression of c-myc, a cellular oncogene both amplified and constitutively expressed in HL-60. We find that cyclic AMP elevation in HL-60 caused by three different pharmacologic regimens is followed by an abrupt, greater than 90% decrease in steady state c-myc mRNA levels within 3 h, well before detectable changes in proliferation and differentiation.

The monoclonal antibody referred to as 38-13 has been previously described and reacted with the globotriaosylceramide [Gb3:Gal(alpha 1----4)-Gal(beta 1----4)-Glc(beta 1----1)ceramide] specifically expressed on surface membrane of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells. An immunotoxin (38-13 IT) combined with the pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) toxin via S-S bridges showed paradoxically a lower cytotoxic effect in BL Ramos cells than in non-BL cells such as leukemic mouse L1210 cells, while these cells appeared not to be involved by flow cytometric analysis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Consequently, the inhibitory effect of selective galactose analogs on the binding and the cytotoxicity of 38-13 antibody conjugated or not to PAP toxin was compared on BL and non-BL cells. Only the galactose blocked in alpha configuration provided a fine inhibition of 38-13 binding on BL Ramos cells and both alpha and beta-galactose allowed us to establish a clear distinction between the pathway entry of 38-13 IT in BL and non-BL cells; in close correlation with the 38-13 binding specificity the 38-13 IT cytotoxic effect in Ramos BL cells could also be prevented by alpha-Gal only, suggesting that this toxic action is probably mediated through the IT binding to Gb3 antigenic sites. In contrast, on apparently irrelevant L1210 cells, 38-13 IT showed a cytotoxic effect which was inhibited preferentially by lactose (Gal in beta configuration). It was discussed that IT binding alone to either antigenic sites which are inhibited by the hapten alpha-Gal, or nonspecific sites which can compete with the hapten beta-Gal is unable to induce efficient killing of cells. But cooperation of both bindings might give an attractive explanation of IT cytotoxic effect. It was concluded that the unexpected activity of 38-13 IT in non-BL cells probably could be mediated through an active macromolecular transport process which could implicate a beta-galactoside-binding protein (lectin).","['Junqua, S', 'Wils, P', 'Mishal, Z', 'Le Pecq, J B']","['Junqua S', 'Wils P', 'Mishal Z', 'Le Pecq JB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Globosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Trihexosylceramides)', '71965-57-6 (globotriaosylceramide)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (pokeweed antiviral protein)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose/*immunology', 'Globosides/*immunology', 'Glycosphingolipids/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Plant Proteins/toxicity', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Ricin/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Trihexosylceramides']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830170404 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1987 Apr;17(4):459-64. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830170404.,,,,,,,,

For this approach I have mainly used normal and leukemic blood cells, and in most studies have used myeloid blood cells as a model system. Our development of systems for the in vitro cloning and clonal differentiation of normal blood cells made it possible to study the controls that regulate growth (multiplication) and differentiation of these normal cells and the changes in these controls in leukemia. Experiments with normal blood cell precursors have shown that normal cells require different proteins to induce growth and differentiation. We have also shown that in normal myeloid precursors, growth-inducing protein induces both growth and production of differentiation-inducing protein so this ensures the coupling between growth and differentiation that occurs in normal development. The origin of malignancy involves uncoupling of growth and differentiation. This can be produced by changes from inducible to constitutive expression of specific genes that result in asynchrony to the coordination required for the normal developmental program. Normal myeloid precursors require an external source of growth-inducing protein for growth, and we have identified different types of leukemic cells. Some no longer require and other constitutively produce their own growth-inducing protein. But addition of the normal differentiation-inducing protein to these malignant cells still induces their normal differentiation, and the mature cells are then no longer malignant. Genetic changes that produce blocks in the ability to be induced to differentiate by the normal inducer occur in the evolution of leukemia. But even these cells can be induced to differentiate by other compounds, including low doses of compounds now being used in cancer therapy, that induce the differentiation program by other pathways. This differentiation of leukemic cells has been obtained in vitro and in vivo, and our in vivo results indicate that this may be a useful approach to therapy. In some tumours, such as sarcomas, reversion from a malignant to a non-malignant phenotype can be a result of chromosome changes that suppress malignancy. But in myeloid leukemia, the stopping of growth in mature cells by induction of differentiation bypasses the genetic changes that produce the malignant phenotype. These conclusions can also be applied to other types of normal and malignant cells.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Biophys,Cell biophysics,8002185,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02797384 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biophys. 1986 Dec;9(1-2):225-42. doi: 10.1007/BF02797384.,,,,,,,,

While this cascade of events that leads to TC killing has been defined, the signal molecules responsible for each of the steps remain largely undetermined. A variety of human leukemia-derived TC lines and clones were analyzed for their sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis and for their ability to bind and activate NK cells. These characteristics have been correlated with TC surface expression of differentiation antigens and carbohydrate residues. Of the cell lines and clones tested, K562, SPI-802, MOLT-4, MOLT-4/C8-1, ZS, KG-1/A-3, and HL-60S were sensitive to NK cell-mediated lysis, while KG-1, THP-1-0, HL-60R, and LFM were resistant. KG-1, THP-1-0, HL-60R, and LFM cells were further studied to determine mechanisms responsible for their resistance to NK cells. It was found that HL-60R and LFM cells were unable to bind NK cells. In contrast, KG-1 and THP-1-0 cells were able to bind to and activate NK cells. Therefore, it is likely that the NK-resistance of KG-1 and THP-1-0 cells may be related to their lack of sensitivity to cytotoxic factors released by bound NK cells. All of the TC cell lines and clones capable of binding NK cells expressed the 3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine hapten (Lex or SSEA-1 antigen) recognized by the monoclonal antibody Leu M1. These TC consistently lacked surface L-fucose residues, as shown by lack of Ulex europaeus agglutinin binding. In contrast, HL-60R and LFM which did not form conjugates with NK cells, did not express surface Lex determinants and avidly bound the Ulex agglutinin. Distinct subpopulations of NK-resistant KG-1 cells expressed Lex antigens or bound Ulex. We compared KG-1/A-3, a NK-sensitive cell clone, with the parental NK-resistant KG-1 cell line. KG-1/A-3 lost the ability to bind the Ulex lectin displayed by the parental cell line and showed increased expression of Lex determinants. Results from these phenotypic analyses suggest that expression of Lex determinants and Ulex binding sites on the TC membrane are mutually exclusive and their expression or absence may correlate with mechanisms which regulate TC-NK cell interactions.","['Zarcone, D', 'Tilden, A B', 'Friedman, H M', 'Grossi, C E']","['Zarcone D', 'Tilden AB', 'Friedman HM', 'Grossi CE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fucose/analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1987/05/15 00:00,1987/05/15 00:01,['1987/05/15 00:00'],"['1987/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 May 15;47(10):2674-82.,['CA-13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

We have studied the effect of this compound on the expression of ODC, transferrin receptor (TFR), and beta-globin during normal cellular proliferation and dimethylsulfoxide-induced terminal differentiation. Elevated RNA levels for ODC were observed during both normal Friend murine erythroleukemia cell division and replication associated with terminal differentiation, but these transcripts decreased as the cells ceased proliferating. However, in the presence of DFMO the levels of ODC remained elevated even when the cells had stopped dividing; this appears to be a feedback mechanism to overcome the effects of the inhibitor. TFR expression paralleled regular cell division and was curtailed when replication was reduced by DFMO. However, the inhibitor was unable to prevent the differentiation associated maintenance of TFR levels, well after proliferation terminated.

Culture methods are available that support both colony formation by AML blasts and the growth of blast stem cells in suspension. Recombinant GM-CSF is active in both culture systems, although to a varying degree. We found that recombinant G-CSF was also effective; however, the two recombinant factors showed striking synergism for the stimulation of blast growth of cells from five of eight AML patients. In these cases, the combination was equivalent to the stimulating activity of supernatants from the continuous cell line 5637. This conditioned medium (HTB9-CM) is considered the standard for blast growth. Blasts from one of the patients grew without added factor. In another instance, recombinant GM-CSF alone was almost as effective as HTB9-CM. In the third case, both recombinant factors were active, but synergism was not observed and their combined effect was not equivalent to that of HTB9-CM. Both GM-CSF and G-CSF were active on normal bone marrow granulopoietic progenitors, but synergism was not observed.

A comparison with antigen stimulation.,4141-5,"Calcium-specific ionophores are used widely to stimulate Ca2+-dependent secretion from cells on the assumption that permeabilization of the cell membranes to Ca2+ ions leads to a rise in concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which in turn serves as a signal for secretion. In this way, events that precede mobilization of Ca2+ ions via receptor stimulation are bypassed. One such event is thought to be the rapid hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids to form inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol. Accordingly, rat leukemic basophil (2H3) cells can be stimulated to secrete histamine either with the ionophores or by aggregation of receptors for IgE in the plasma membrane. We find, however, that ionophore A23187 stimulates secretion of histamine only at concentrations (200-1000 nM) that stimulate hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids. The extent of hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids was dependent on the concentration of ionophore and the presence of external Ca2+ ions and correlated with the magnitude of the secretory response. A similar correlation between secretion and hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids was observed in response to the Ca2+-specific ionophore, ionomycin. Although this hydrolysis (possibly a consequence of elevated [Ca2+]i) was less extensive than that induced by aggregation of receptors, it may govern the secretory response to A23187. The studies revealed one paradox. The rise in [Ca2+]i depended on intracellular ATP levels, when either an ionophore or antigen was used as a stimulant irrespective of whether hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids was stimulated or not. The concept of how the ionophores act, therefore, requires critical reevaluation.","['Lo, T N', 'Saul, W', 'Beaven, M A']","['Lo TN', 'Saul W', 'Beaven MA']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Basophils/immunology/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology']",1987/03/25 00:00,1987/03/25 00:01,['1987/03/25 00:00'],"['1987/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)61323-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Mar 25;262(9):4141-5.,,,,,,,,

We have asked whether calcitriol has a direct effect on the transcription of the c-myc gene. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) decreased RNA elongation in a nuclear run-off transcription assay by 4 h after treatment. In the continuous presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, HL-60 cell transcription of c-myc was decreased by 38% at 4 h and was abolished by 48 h. In contrast, the transcription of beta-actin was not affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. The rate of transcription of c-myc and beta-actin was proportional to the number of nuclei and to time. Furthermore, specific hybridization of c-myc and beta-actin RNA was a linear function of RNA input. After a 48-h treatment, the c-myc/beta-actin ratio was decreased by 80-100% at [32P]RNA inputs ranging from 2 to 20 X 10(6) cpm/ml. These data temporally correlate inhibition of c-myc transcription with decreases in the steady-state levels of c-myc mRNA as assessed by Northern blot analysis.

The IFNs are divided into three main classes, alpha, beta, and gamma, and are defined by their differences in amino acid sequences, physicochemical properties, and induction by different agents from different cell types. The inducing agents include viruses, bacteria, bacterial products, polymers, low molecular weight compounds, and antigens or mitogens. Studies on the mechanisms of action of IFNs have mainly been focused on their antiviral actions. However, many of the facts revealed by these studies are equally relevant for understanding other actions of IFN. IFNs are extremely potent, they interact with specific receptors, and they induce the expression of specific genes, the products of which mediate their various actions. There is almost a complete lack of knowledge of what happens between the interaction of IFN with its receptor and induction of new RNA synthesis. However, we are beginning to understand how some of the IFN-inducible enzymes impair viral replication. The discovery of the dsRNA-dependent enzymes has implications beyond the IFN system. It is quite possible that they are used for other physiologic regulatory systems as well. The identities and functions of many other IFN-inducible proteins remain to be elucidated. Principally, IFNs alpha and beta are cytokines in that they may be produced by the cellular components of the immune system and have immunoregulatory effects on the cells of the immune system. These effects include enhancement of surface structures such as histocompatibility antigens, pleiotropic hormone-like effects, and stimulation or inhibition of the activities of a number of different effector cells such as B cells, T cells, macrophages, and natural killing cells. IFN levels may be below detection and yet mediate important biologic functions. Perhaps the most interesting IFN subtype regarding immunoregulation is IFN gamma, which is a product of T lymphocytes. Few drugs have stimulated as much research interest or clinical promise as the IFNs. Clinical trials in patients have shown most promise in coryza, herpes virus infections, papilloma virus tumors, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, and renal cell carcinoma. IFN gamma employed alone and in combination with IFN alpha may dramatically increase IFN's activity. IFN treatment combined with chemotherapy also may give enhanced antitumor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Stanton, G J', 'Weigent, D A', 'Fleischmann, W R Jr', 'Dianzani, F', 'Baron, S']","['Stanton GJ', 'Weigent DA', 'Fleischmann WR Jr', 'Dianzani F', 'Baron S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Invest Radiol,Investigative radiology,0045377,"['0 (Interferon Inducers)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Infections/drug therapy', 'Interferon Inducers/pharmacology', '*Interferons/biosynthesis/classification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1987/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004424-198703000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest Radiol. 1987 Mar;22(3):259-73. doi: 10.1097/00004424-198703000-00017.,,,,,,152,,

C57BL/6 (B6) mice injected with B- or NB-fibrotropic clones, but not with TV or N-tropic viral clones, developed reactive T lymphocytes (Tr), capable of differentiating into anti-tumor cytotoxic cells. The N-tropic virus isolates were non-immunogenic in B6 mice whereas the TV isolate induced suppressor T lymphocytes (Ts) that abrogated a potential Tr response.

In seven cases the solid tumour was identified after diagnosing CLL, without any cytostatic therapy having been made here before. In addition, a report is given on a patient showing symptoms of gastric cancer not radically removed and a lymphocytic reaction. Initially, the case was explained as gastric adenocancer with simultaneous CLL because even 5 years after surgical treatment there were 16-20 X 10(6)/l of leukocytes with 64% of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and 85% of lympho-reticular cells in the bone marrow. Two years later, however, the blood picture was normal and remained to be unchanged further on. Thus, it seems that the healing of the gastric cancer has caused the lymphocytic reaction to have ceased. In addition, it should be noted that in 1974 the patient suffered from an epithelium after a scratch-mark on the nose tip, which was irradiated, however, without eliciting any lymphocytic reaction. The patient is still alive (June 1985).","['Hadnagy, C', 'Marinca, E', 'Macavei, I', 'Sass, G']","['Hadnagy C', 'Marinca E', 'Macavei I', 'Sass G']",,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch,"Folia haematologica (Leipzig, Germany : 1928)",0374615,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Carcinoma/*complications/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/complications/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/complications/immunology/surgery']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch. 1986;113(5):633-7.,,,,,Beitrag zum gemeinsamen Vorkommen von chronisch lymphatischer Leukamie mit malignen Tumoren und uber die durch Malignome verursachte lymphozytare Reaktion.,,,

Seven clones from the murine immunogenic leukemia L1210/DTIC were selected and studied in some detail. Three of the seven clones showed an increased immunogenicity in vivo since two clones (D5 and D7) were rejected by syngenic mice and one (D6) prolonged the life span for 3 weeks (untreated tumours killed the mice in 7 days). The seven clones and the L1210/DTIC were recognized and lysed by in vivo primed, in vitro stimulated (with L1210/DTIC) lymphocytes. Therefore, the seven clones shared antigens with the L1210-DTIC immunogenic subline. Secondary stimulated lymphocytes to clone D5, and clone D7 were able to lyse D5, D6 and D7 cells, respectively, but were unable to recognize the remaining clones. From in vivo and in vitro studies, all the L1210/DTIC sublines are composed of cells carrying two or more distinct antigens. Each cell clone expressed one set of antigens.

Several antibodies to more abundant cell-surface determinants (T200, Ly15, H-2Db) do not inhibit this interaction. Under capping conditions, either of the antibodies to L3T4 or TCR epitopes modulate virus binding receptors from the surface of C6VL/1 cells. L3T4 and the TCR do not comodulate significantly on the surface of C6VL/1 cells. These experimental findings implicate the existence of rare TCR-L3T4 complexes on C6VL/1 cells, and the involvement of these complexes in the binding of C6VL/1 to its cognate retrovirus.

SN5 and SN5c were generated separately by immunizing two mice with a leukemia antigen preparation isolated from uncultured non-T-/non-B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells whereas SN5a and SN5b were generated by immunizing a third mouse with intact KM-3 (a cultured non-T-/non-B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line) cells. It was found that the binding activities of mAbs SN5 and SN5c generated by using an isolated leukemia antigen preparation were approximately twice as large as those of mAbs SN5a and SN5b generated by using intact leukemia cells. All four of the present mAbs induced antigenic modulation of CALLA on the leukemia cells in vitro; subclasses of mAbs appear to be an important factor which influences the kinetics of antigenic modulation. SN5, SN5a, and SN5c immunoprecipitated a distinct Mr 100,000 component from detergent-solubilized cell membrane antigens but SN5b failed to do so. These four mAbs together with J5, another anti-CALLA mAb, were individually tested in a solid phase radioimmunoassay for reactivity with the detergent extracts of various human tissues, i.e., kidney, lymph node, spleen, brain, liver, pancreas, lung, and heart. SN5, SN5a, SN5c, and J5 showed reaction only with kidney whereas SN5b did not show significant reaction with any tissues including kidney. However, SN5b as well as SN5 showed a significant reaction with kidney in an immunoperoxidase-staining test. These results indicate that the interaction of SN5b with a unique epitope on the CALLA moleucle is strongly disturbed by relatively mild detergents (deoxycholate, taurocholate, and Nonidet P-450). These detergents did not significantly disturb the reaction between other mAbs (SN5, SN5a, and SN5c) and the corresponding epitopes on the CALLA molecule. Competitive binding experiments show that the three epitopes recognized by SN5, SN5b, and SN5c are sufficiently close to each other to allow complete or nearly complete reciprocal inhibition of binding to CALLA present on leukemia cells. Peculiar inhibition patterns, however, were observed between SN5a and the other three mAbs. SN5, SN5b, and SN5c inhibited only partially the subsequent binding of SN5a to the leukemia cells. Conversely, SN5a inhibited nearly fully the subsequent bindings of SN5, SN5b, and SN5c.

On a molecular level, the evolution of CML to acute leukemia is a multistep process. We propose that an early step, at the stem cell level, is acquisition of the ability for gene movement, which allows subsequent submicroscopic and chromosomal rearrangements that cause changes in the growth characteristics and regulation of the stem cell. A specific platelet DNA polymerase (PDP - reverse transcriptase) may play a role in gene movement. The characteristic reciprocal translocation of chromosomes #9 and #22, causing the activation of the c-abl oncogene, appears to be responsible for the uncontrolled cellular growth. Yet, other growth factors (e.g., platelet derived growth factor) and activated oncogenes (e.g., c-sis) must be responsible for the stimulation, progression, and variability seen during the course of the disease. Because CML is a progressive disease with clinically definable stages, CML appears to be a model system for the study of the molecular basis of the progression of preleukemia to leukemia specifically, and preneoplasia to aggressive neoplasia in general.","['Brodsky, I', 'Hubbell, H R', 'Strayer, D R', 'Gillespie, D H']","['Brodsky I', 'Hubbell HR', 'Strayer DR', 'Gillespie DH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/therapy', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(87)90129-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(87)90129-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1987 May;26(1):15-23. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(87)90129-4.,"['CA29545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

A decrease in DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and in cloning efficiency occurred within three hours of exposure of HL-60 promyelocytes to TNF. The TNF in combination with recombinant interferons produced an additive or synergistic inhibition of colony formation of HL-60 and THP-1 myelomonoblasts. Normal human CFU-GM are sensitive to TNF (ED50 between 100 and 50,000 U/mL), but their sensitivity to TNF depends on the source of colony stimulating factor (CSF) with T lymphocyte derived GM-CSF (recombinant or natural) partially protecting the CFU-GM from the suppression exerted by TNF (and interferons). In eight of 15 cases the clonogenic myeloid leukemia cells from patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia were more sensitive than normal CFU-GM using GM-CSF as a source of colony stimulating activity.

A lower concentration of the mamba toxin led to a nearly selective inhibition of MCD peptide binding to the hippocampal region which is responsible for the convulsant properties of the 2 types of polypeptide toxins.","['Bidard, J N', 'Mourre, C', 'Lazdunski, M']","['Bidard JN', 'Mourre C', 'Lazdunski M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Bee Venoms)', '0 (Convulsants)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neurotoxins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Receptors, Cholinergic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (dendrotoxin receptor)', '0 (mast cell degranulating peptide receptor)', '32908-73-9 (mast cell degranulating peptide)', '74811-93-1 (dendrotoxin)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bee Venoms/*metabolism', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Convulsants', 'Elapid Venoms/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Ion Channels/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Neurotoxins/*metabolism', 'Peptides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Potassium/metabolism', '*Potassium Channels', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cholinergic/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Peptide', 'Synaptosomes/metabolism']",1987/02/27 00:00,1987/02/27 00:01,['1987/02/27 00:00'],"['1987/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(87)90677-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(87)90677-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1987 Feb 27;143(1):383-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(87)90677-2.,,,,,,,,

Each drug was given in a dosage of 150 mg/m2 i.v. daily for 5 consecutive days. A complete response (CR) was obtained in 8 of 22 patients (36%) and a partial response was seen in two others, yielding an overall response rate of 45%. Median survival for all 22 patients was 2.5 months, but medium survival was 7.2 months (range 4.3-13 months) for those with a CR. Twelve of 22 died during the first 3 months, seven of these during the period of drug-induced aplasia. Moderate to severe toxicity included serious infection (16 of 22); nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (19 of 22); and mucositis (10 of 22). There were four instances each of cardiac abnormalities and hepatic abnormalities but all reversed spontaneously. We conclude that this combination therapy cannot be recommended for further investigation in relapsed patients with ANLL since there was no notable increase in long-term survival and since there were 10 treatment-related deaths out of 22 patients.","['Kahn, S B', 'Spiers, A', 'Knospe, W H', 'Soojian, M', 'Glick, J H']","['Kahn SB', 'Spiers A', 'Knospe WH', 'Soojian M', 'Glick JH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-198702000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1987 Feb;10(1):78-81. doi: 10.1097/00000421-198702000-00017.,"['CA06594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25988/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

The type of channel involved in the generation of this current appears to be present throughout all stages of pre-B-cell differentiation, since it is detected in pre-B cell lines infected with Abelson murine leukemia virus; these cell lines represent various phases of B-cell development. Thus, the presence of this channel is not obviously correlated with B-cell differentiation. Although blocked by Co2+, the channel, or channels, does not appear to be activated by Ca2+ entry. It is, however, inactivated by high intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. In addition, elevation of intracellular adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate induces at all potentials a rapid decrease in the peak potassium conductance and increased rates of activation and inactivation. Therefore, potassium channels can be physiologically modulated by second messengers in lymphocytes.","['Choquet, D', 'Sarthou, P', 'Primi, D', 'Cazenave, P A', 'Korn, H']","['Choquet D', 'Sarthou P', 'Primi D', 'Cazenave PA', 'Korn H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/physiology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Immunocompetence', 'Ion Channels/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Potassium/*metabolism']",1987/03/06 00:00,1987/03/06 00:01,['1987/03/06 00:00'],"['1987/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2434998 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1987 Mar 6;235(4793):1211-4. doi: 10.1126/science.2434998.,,,,,,,,

Mouse antibody raised against the placental enzyme completely inhibits the activity of enzymes from human placenta and HeLa cells and cross-reacts with the enzymes from calf thymus and mouse testis. Immunoperoxidase staining with this antibody demonstrates the intranuclear localization of the enzyme in human leukemia cells.

In this study the effect of interferons (IFNs) on the inhibition has been analysed. Both alpha IFN- and gamma IFN-pretreated peripheral blood lymphocytes are effectively inhibited by monolayer target cells. IFN treatment of lymphocytes does not change cytotoxicity against the inhibitory target cells, although it enhances reactivity against NK-sensitive target cells. Treatment of monolayer cells with interferons significantly reduces their inhibitory capacity. However, diminished inhibition of NK activity by the IFN-treated target cells is not associated with increased lysis, probably due to their decreased sensitivity to natural killer cytotoxic factors (NKCF). In 18.5% of the cases studied, monolayer target cells induced endogenous IFN production in lymphocytes. In these cases no inhibition of the NK activity of the effector cells was seen. According to the results of this paper, IFNs have a dual effect on the NK regulatory system: they enhance the NK activity of the effector cells against NK-sensitive target cells, and they change the NK resistant target cells in a way that makes them less inhibitory to NK activity but simultaneously more resistant to the toxic factors secreted by NK cells.","['Heiskala, M']",['Heiskala M'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Contact Inhibition', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Proteins/immunology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1987 Feb;60(2):167-72.,,PMC1453230,,,,,,

Here we report results from an in vitro assay, showing allogeneic lymphocyte cytotoxicity in cell suspensions enriched for NK activity against tumour cells by Percoll gradient centrifugation of nylon-wool non-adherent cells. The addition of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) to the NK-target cell cultures greatly enhanced the cytotoxic response against K562 and allogeneic, but not syngeneic, lymphocytes. The effector cells of ALC are present in the spleen of both euthymic and athymic nude rats, and to a lesser extent in the blood. ALC is augmented by interferon pretreatment of the effector cells, and by depleting the effector cell suspensions of all T cells and helper T cells with the monoclonal antibody MRC Ox19 and W3/25, respectively. Conversely, the activity was nearly abolished by depleting the cell suspensions of MRC Ox8+ cells reacting with rat cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. Furthermore, removal of residual B cells (Ox12+ cells) from the effector cells or attempts to block any putative antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic mechanism in vitro with the monoclonal antibody Ox12 did not inhibit the NK activity against allogeneic lymphocytes nor against tumour cells. ALC in vitro did not discriminate between T and B or large and small lymphocyte targets. These characteristics of the ALC effector cells substantiate that they are present within the thymus-independent population of cells with NK activity, and are dependent on neither B cells nor immunoglobulin for their recognition and destruction of the target.","['Rolstad, B', 'Fossum, S']","['Rolstad B', 'Fossum S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Separation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/classification/immunology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1987 Feb;60(2):151-7.,,PMC1453234,,,,,,

We have examined different morphological types of leukocytes directly obtained from patients at the blast crisis stage of CML for expression of P210bcr-abl tyrosine protein kinase activity. Phosphorylation of P210bcr-abl in an immune complex kinase assay using an anti-v-abl peptide serum was observed in blast cells from four Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive CML patients in blast crisis. P210bcr-abl protein kinase activity was detected regardless of whether the blast cells were of myeloid, lymphoid, or undifferentiated morphology. P210bcr-abl protein kinase activity was not detected in immune complexes either from leukocytes of four Ph1-negative CML patients in blast crisis, of five acute myelogenous leukemia patients, or in the promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Mature myeloid cells are associated with an inhibitory factor for not only P210bcr-abl protein kinase activity, but also protein kinases in general. Therefore, analyses of Ph1-positive benign phase CML myeloid cells, the majority of which are well differentiated, could not be successfully performed. The inhibition of P210bcr-abl protein kinase activity is not a specific property of mature cells from CML patients since granulocytes from a normal volunteer also demonstrated a similar effect. However, extracts of Ph1-positive cultured B-lymphocytes from a patient in benign phase demonstrated active P210bcr-abl protein indicating that the P210bcr-abl protein is expressed in an enzymatically active form in the earlier phases of CML. In addition to the previously reported P210 and P190 abl-related proteins, a novel Mr 53,000 protein was found to undergo phosphorylation at serine and tyrosine in immune complex kinase assays of two blast crisis CML cell lines (K562 and EM2) and in samples from blast crisis patients in which P210bcr-abl was detected. Peptide mapping by the Cleveland technique suggested that Mr 53,000 protein is unrelated to P210bcr-abl. Immune complex kinase assays of K562 cells with an anti-src serum (GD-11) yielded active c-src kinase and a Mr 50,000 phosphorylated protein, both of which were resistant to alkaline hydrolysis.

In contrast, asparaginase had no significant effect on methotrexate polyglutamate accumulation and methotrexate retention when administered after methotrexate. These data indicated that the asparaginase-induced modulation of methotrexate polyglutamylation in mice was directly related to the time course of inhibition and recovery of tumor cell proliferation by asparaginase, and thus varied with the intrinsic sensitivity of the individual tumor to the enzyme.","['Sur, P', 'Fernandes, D J', 'Kute, T E', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Sur P', 'Fernandes DJ', 'Kute TE', 'Capizzi RL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptides)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Mar 1;47(5):1313-8.,['CA12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The total sialidase activity was determined using disialoganglioside GD1a and fetuin as exogenous substrates. The enzymatic activity was stimulated by 0.08% Triton X-100 and reached the highest level at pH 4.0. Results obtained showed that gangliosides are hydrolysed more extensively than glycoproteins by K 562 sialidases. This finding could suggest that endogenous gangliosides may be the main source of metabolically available sialic acid in K 562 cell line. After treatment of K 562 cells by Adriamycin (40 nM), a potent anticancer drug, sialidase activity decreased by 40% as compared to control cells. This decrease occurs early during the first day of incubation with Adriamycin. This inhibition of sialidase activity could explain previous results obtained in our laboratory which show an enhanced sialylation of the membrane glycoconjugates after Adriamycin treatment.","['Madoulet, C', 'Trentesaux, C', 'Benoist, H', 'Rebel, G', 'Dreyfus, H', 'Jardillier, J C']","['Madoulet C', 'Trentesaux C', 'Benoist H', 'Rebel G', 'Dreyfus H', 'Jardillier JC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Neuraminidase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/metabolism']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1986 Dec;9(1):15-23.,,,,,,,,

Such tumor-derived light chains of the lambda type from a patient with typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been used to raise mouse monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). A hybridoma-secreting antibody that recognized the idiotypic lambda chain but not normal lambda chains by a preliminary screen but which also reacted with idiotypic IgM from the patient's tumor cells was selected. This MoAb in fact recognized 1 in 20 X 10(3) molecules of pooled normal lambda chains, thus establishing its specificity for a private idiotypic determinant. It failed to give a detectable reaction with normal IgM, normal serum, or a panel of IgM paraproteins. The antibody bound to the patient's neoplastic B cells but not to normal tonsillar cells. The site of binding of the antibody to idiotypic IgM is clearly separate from that of another MoAb specific for idiotypic determinants on heavy plus light chains, since the two showed additive binding curves. The determinant also appeared to be less available in dimeric lambda chains than in monomeric lambda chains or in idiotypic IgM. Antibodies to idiotypic determinants on light chains show some technical advantages and should be useful for monitoring and possibly treating B cell tumors, either alone or together with the more conventional anti-idiotypic antibodies that usually recognize the heavy and light chain combination.","['Wrightham, M', 'Tutt, A L', 'Glennie, M J', 'Hamblin, T J', 'Stevenson, G T', 'Stevenson, F K']","['Wrightham M', 'Tutt AL', 'Glennie MJ', 'Hamblin TJ', 'Stevenson GT', 'Stevenson FK']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Paraproteins)', '0 (anti-IgM)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*immunology', '*Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Paraproteins/immunology']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69839-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Mar;69(3):919-23.,,,,,,,,

It contains the aglycone of coformycin, i.e. 3,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d][1,3]diazepin-8-o1, coupled to the unusual carbohydrate, 2'-chloro-2'-deoxyribose. 2'-Chloropentostatin is a slightly weaker inhibitor of rat and human adenosine deaminases than coformycin, and considerably weaker than pentostatin. Unlike pentostatin, which appears to undergo a two-stage interaction with adenosine deaminase, 2'-chloropentostatin forms a single enzyme-inhibitor complex. The enzyme-inhibitor complex between adenosine deaminase and 2'-chloropentostatin was much more rapidly dissociable than the complex with pentostatin. The complex between adenosine deaminase and 2'-chloropentostatin dissociated with a half-life of approximately 3 hr, compared with 68 hr for the complex between adenosine deaminase and pentostatin. 2'-Chloropentostatin, at concentrations up to 10 micromolar, did not cause significant inhibition of growth of WI-L2 human B-cell lymphoblasts, or of CCRF-CEM human T-cell lymphoblasts in culture. However, it greatly potentiated the inhibitory potency of adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, or arabinosyladenine towards these cell lines. This potentiating effect was equipotent for 2'-chloropentostatin and pentostatin. T-cells (CCRF-CEM) were much more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of combinations of adenosine or 2'-deoxyadenosine with 2'-chloropentostatin or pentostatin than were B-cells (WI-L2). Pentostatin and 2'-chloropentostatin had no significant antitumor activity against mouse leukemia L1210 in vivo. However, these adenosine deaminase inhibitors, at nontoxic doses, greatly potentiated the antitumor activity of ara-A 5'-phosphate. 2'-Chloropentostatin was somewhat more active in this regard than was pentostatin.","['Jackson, R C', 'Leopold, W R', 'Ross, D A']","['Jackson RC', 'Leopold WR', 'Ross DA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '96328-17-5 (adechlorin)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/pharmacology', '*Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Pentostatin', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred ACI', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(86)90011-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1986;25:125-39. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(86)90011-7.,['N01-CM-37614/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

A major question, however, is how their substrates mediate changes in gene expression (reviewed in refs 6-8). Because binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences represents the most direct mechanism for regulating transcription, we have investigated the possibility that some DNA-binding proteins may be substrates of protein-tyrosine kinases. Here, we present evidence for nuclear phosphotyrosyl-proteins in murine fibroblasts transformed by the v-abl protein-tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, we have found that these proteins are not significantly phosphorylated in normal NIH 3T3 cells. Finally, using affinity competition chromatography with bacterial and mouse DNA, we have demonstrated that some of these proteins preferentially bind to mouse DNA. The identification of phosphotyrosyl-proteins with selective DNA-binding properties suggests a possible mechanism through which protein-tyrosine kinases may effect changes in gene transcription.","['Bell, J C', 'Mahadevan, L C', 'Colledge, W H', 'Frackelton, A R Jr', 'Sargent, M G', 'Foulkes, J G']","['Bell JC', 'Mahadevan LC', 'Colledge WH', 'Frackelton AR Jr', 'Sargent MG', 'Foulkes JG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*enzymology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Viral Proteins/physiology']",1987/02/05 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/02/05 00:00'],"['1987/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/325552a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1987 Feb 5-11;325(6104):552-4. doi: 10.1038/325552a0.,['CA 39235/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

K3, but not dicumarol, cytotoxicity was abrogated by 1 mM cysteine. Isobolographic analysis of the effect of K3-dicumarol combinations, in the concentration ranges between 5 and 75 microM, on L1210 growth, indicated synergy between the two drugs. K3 (10 microM) caused a 3-fold stimulation of KCN-resistant O2 consumption by L1210 cells; addition of 50 microM dicumarol did not enhance KCN-resistant O2 consumption further, suggesting that K3-dicumarol synergy in L1210 was not due to dicumarol-mediated augmentation of K3-semiquinone-free radical formation. We examined the effect of dicumarol addition on L1210 cellular metabolites known to be affected by K3, i.e., glutathione, NADPH and ATP. Dicumarol prevented the elevation of the glutathione pool caused by less than or equal to 18 microM K3. K3-dicumarol combinations depleted the NADPH pool significantly, at concentrations of each which did not affect the NADPH pool. No synergistic effect on the ATP pool was observed. Thus, although the mechanism of K3-dicumarol synergy vs. leukemia remained unclear, it was possible that effects on the glutathione and/or NADPH pools contributed. We also investigated the effect of K3 and dicumarol on 45Ca++ transport by L1210 cells because of their effects on glutathione. Neither drug affected 45Ca++ influx or efflux rate constants. However, equilibrium 45Ca++ uptake was suppressed by K3 at concentrations lower than those which depleted glutathione.","['Akman, S A', 'Doroshow, J H', 'Dietrich, M F', 'Chlebowski, R T', 'Block, J S']","['Akman SA', 'Doroshow JH', 'Dietrich MF', 'Chlebowski RT', 'Block JS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Quinones)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cysteine/pharmacology', 'Dicumarol/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Quinones/metabolism', 'Vitamin K/*administration & dosage']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1987 Feb;240(2):486-91.,['CA 31788/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

This newly identified proteinase inhibitor (LPI 1) did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of four other serine proteinases (thrombin, plasmin, chymotrypsin, or pancreatic elastase), a thiol proteinase (papain), or a carboxyl proteinase (pepsin). Active synthesis of LPI 1 by the C91/PL cell line was shown by the appearance of similar levels of inhibitory activity in sequential cell supernatants, lack of appearance of inhibitor in supernatants of cells killed by heat or sodium azide or of viable cells in the presence of cyclohexamide, and incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid into newly synthesized inhibitor. Although both the inhibitor of rabbit origin and of human origin are proteins produced by T cells and have similar inhibitory specificity, important differences were observed: LPI 1 is sensitive to boiling and the two inhibitors migrate differently upon electrophoresis in substrate-containing polyacrylamide gel. Furthermore, LPI 1 was produced by a cell line of the T4 phenotype which had been established by in vitro viral transformation of human cord blood lymphocytes with HTLV 1 whereas the inhibitor of rabbit origin was produced by normal splenic T cells. Three other human T cell lines of the T4 phenotype, MOLT-13, KE-37, and HPB-ALL, from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia did not produce a proteinase inhibitor.

Immunoprecipitation of B54.2 antibody-binding molecules from each population of mast cells labeled intrinsically with [35S]methionine and analysis by SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the B54.2 epitope was expressed in each case on two noncovalently associated proteins of 110,000 Mr and approximately 130,000 Mr, but that the percentage of radiolabel in the latter species was approximately threefold less in ABFTL-MC than in BM-MC. As assessed by pulse-chase analysis with [35S]methionine, the 110,000 Mr protein was a precursor of the 130,000 Mr molecule (""B54.2 antigen"") synthesized by BM-MC. Labeling of BM-MC with [35S]methionine in the presence of tunicamycin followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE of B54.2 antibody-binding material revealed a single species of 93,000 Mr, indicating that the native molecules contained N-linked carbohydrate. Endoglycosidase H treatment of the glycoproteins precipitated by B54.2 antibody from BM-MC reduced the Mr of the 110,000-Mr molecule to 93,000 Mr without an appreciable change in the 130,000-Mr species. These data indicate that the 110,000-Mr precursor form is a ""high mannose"" type glycoprotein and the 130,000-Mr membrane surface B54.2 antigen is a ""complex"" type glycoprotein, and that the epitope recognized by the B54.2 antibody on the surface of the mouse mast cell populations is located on the 93,000-Mr peptide core.","['Katz, H R', 'Austen, K F']","['Katz HR', 'Austen KF']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Carbohydrates/analysis', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epitopes/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Mast Cells/classification/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Feb 15;138(4):1196-200.,"['AI-22531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-35984/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-36308/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

Equilibrium binding constants were shown to range between 10(7) and 10(8) M-1 for univalent Fab' gamma fragments and between 10(8) and 10(9) M-1 for intact IgG. Saturation of the cell surface binding sites was achieved with 2.9 X 10(5) Fab' gamma molecules/cell and 1.2 X 10(5) IgG molecules/cell for each antibody, a result that is consistent with a bivalent mode of interaction for the IgG. Despite these overall similarities in binding characteristics antibodies showed striking differences in their ability to clear Ig from the cell surface by antigenic modulation in vitro. This suggested differences in the readiness with which the antibodies cross-linked neighboring surface Ig molecules. Such an interpretation was supported by differences in the times required to achieve bivalent binding at 0 degree C, and in the rates at which labeled antibody dissociated from the cell surface in the presence or absence of an excess of unlabeled antibody. The data are consistent with there being two functionally distinct types of anti-idiotype antibody: those that form predominantly intra-Ig bridges, with each antibody Fab being linked to an Fab on one target molecule (""monogamous"" binding) and not favoring modulation; and those that form predominantly inter-Ig bridges (""bigamous"" binding) and favor modulation. The nature of interaction is presumably dictated by the orientation of the particular idiotope concerned. This distinction could be of great importance in the therapeutic use of anti-idiotype to ablate B cell neoplasms.","['Elliott, T J', 'Glennie, M J', 'McBride, H M', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Elliott TJ', 'Glennie MJ', 'McBride HM', 'Stevenson GT']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antibody Affinity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Feb 1;138(3):981-8.,,,,,,,,

In order to define characteristics of decisions to adopt palliative care, including those factors influencing whether a particular patient received palliation, the frequency of this therapeutic posture, and the duration of this treatment period, we performed a retrospective analytical survey of all patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) treated at Duke University Medical Center over the past ten years. Logistic regression analysis identified several potentially significant variables influencing the decision to adopt palliative care. Using a stepwise logistic model, the only independent variable associated with adoption of palliative therapy was initial treatment off a research protocol (P = 0.0001). Initial treatment off a research protocol was itself associated with older age (P = 0.0002), nonspontaneous onset of leukemia (P = 0.005), female sex (P = 0.003), and the absence of dependent children (P = 0.01) when examined by multivariate logistic regression. The palliative treatment interval was defined as the time between the discontinuation of aggressive treatment and the patient's death. Fifty-one percent, 119 of 235 patients, received palliative care; of these, 47% were palliated from the time of diagnosis and 53% were palliated only after receiving remission induction therapy. The median duration for the palliative care period was 46 days (50 days for the initially palliated group, 24 days for the group receiving aggressive therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Neuss, M N', 'Feussner, J R', 'DeLong, E R', 'Cohen, H J']","['Neuss MN', 'Feussner JR', 'DeLong ER', 'Cohen HJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Geriatr Soc,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,7503062,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1532-5415.1987.tb01341.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Geriatr Soc. 1987 Feb;35(2):125-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.1987.tb01341.x.,"['5T32CA-09307-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 0317-7/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11265-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

RNA extracted from this structure shows a complex pattern: as well as ribosomal 28 S and 18 S RNA, small amounts of heterogeneous nuclear RNA and small nuclear RNA are also present. The protein composition of the network indicates a strong domination of ribosomal polypeptides. This fact, considered together with the sedimentation characteristics of the prevailing type of particles isolated directly from the network, supports the conclusion that ribosomal particles are the representative particulate elements. Further electrophoretic analysis of the protein has pointed out that it also contains a significant number of acidic polypeptides. Control experiments have suggested that the site of origin of the network fragments studied is not nucleolar: the fragments are released during extraction, most probably from the nuclear periphery. It is not yet clear whether this structure is localized only at the nuclear periphery or represents an extensive structure, occupying the entire volume of the nucleus.

The average number of bands per NOR in banded cells of these patients was 0.40 +/- 0.06 for the Ph NOR, not significantly different from the 0.41 +/- 0.02 per D chromosome NOR or the 0.41 +/- 0.04 per G. Across the 33 cases, the number of different Ph NOR banded in at least one cell (23 of 33, 70%) was also closely similar to the cumulative maximum number of chromosome D NOR banded per cell (137 of 198 banded, 69%) and G NOR banded (67 of 99, 67%). We conclude that the activity of rRNA genes in Ph NOR is closely similar to that of the other nine NOR in each CGL cell. In situ hybridization of 3H-labeled complementary rRNA to NOR of two patients revealed that the mean number of Ph NOR grains fell within the range of the other NOR. Also, grain distributions across the NOR of leukemic cells closely matched those of stimulated lymphocytes. Thus, a limited sampling has shown no evidence for consistent differences or changes in the rRNA gene number of Ph NOR.","['Brasch, J M', 'Smyth, D R']","['Brasch JM', 'Smyth DR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Nucleolus Organizer Region', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Ribosomal/genetics', 'Silver', 'Staining and Labeling']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(87)90168-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(87)90168-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1987 Mar;25(1):131-9. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(87)90168-3.,,,,,,,,

Two carriers were used in this study, one derived from dex-T-10 (Mr-10000) and the other from dex-T-40 (Mr-40000). The two platinum (II) drugs formed soluble complexes with both carriers. Uncomplexed and complexed drugs were tested and found to be cytotoxic in vitro against 5 murine and 2 human derived tumor cell lines. The two free platinum (II) drugs were cytotoxic against these cells to a similar extent. In comparison to the free drugs the complexes were somewhat less active, up to 3 fold, against murine 38C-13, L1210, EL-4 and RDM-4 leukemias, as well as against human HeLa and osteogenic sarcoma, and as active as the free drugs against murine F9 embryonal carcinoma. There were no major differences in the in vitro cytotoxic activity between CM-dex T-10 and CM-dex T-40 complexes. Differences due to the molecular size of the carrier were observed in vivo: The CM-dex T-10 complexes were significantly less toxic than the free drugs, whereas the reduction of toxicity by complexing to CM-dex T-40 was less profound. As for the efficacy, when tested in vivo against a cis-DDP sensitive tumor (F9) the T-40 complexes were equally or even more effective than the respective free drugs. The T-10 complexes were less effective than the free drugs at equal drug doses but their effectivity increased at increasing drug levels. These complexes were, however, very effective in inhibiting tumor growth upon repeated injections, leading to 100% survival.","['Schechter, B', 'Pauzner, R', 'Wilchek, M', 'Arnon, R']","['Schechter B', 'Pauzner R', 'Wilchek M', 'Arnon R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '20115-65-5 (diamminediaqua platinum(II))', '9044-05-7 (carboxymethyl dextran)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dextrans/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Teratoma/drug therapy']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1986 Oct;8(4):289-98.,,,,,,,,

We suggested that the difference might be explained by considering the cellular mechanisms responsible for growth in suspension and colony formation. In the former, the clonogenic cells increase in number (self-renewal); in the latter, most of the divisions are terminal. The increased sensitivity to ara-C in suspension might then be attributed to its ability to inhibit self-renewal to a greater degree than cell division generally. A test of this hypothesis would be to compare the survival curves in suspension and in methylcellulose using a drug that spared or stimulated self-renewal. Such an agent is 5-azacytidine (5-aza) and has the additional advantage that its analogue, 6-azacytidine (6-aza) has no effect on self renewal. The data supported the hypothesis, since clonogenic AML blasts were much less sensitive to 5-aza in suspension than in methylcellulose. The effect of 6-aza, while qualitatively similar, was much less marked. Controls showed that the difference in survival curves could not be explained on a kinetic basis or by the secretion of growth factors by 5-aza-treated cells. We suggest that a comparison of the effects of drugs in suspension and in methylcellulose may be useful in preclinical screening of putative anti-AML compounds.","['Wang, C', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Wang C', 'McCulloch EA']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68897-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Feb;69(2):553-9.,,,,,,,,

Splenectomy for bulk symptoms provided good palliation of symptoms, but the duration of the benefit was limited by the stage of the disease. Five of eight patients with CGL with bulk symptoms died within 6 months of operation. Splenectomy for hyperfunction was limited to a short-term hematologic response. In three of four patients with CLL who were Coombs positive, the presence of autoantibodies correlated with a recurrent transfusion requirement within 3 months of splenectomy. Thus, the benefit of splenectomy for bulk symptoms must be weighed against the risk of surgery and the patient's limited life expectancy. The benefit of splenectomy for treatment of splenic hyperfunction depends on the stimulus to hyperfunction and may not be beneficial for patients with refractory autoimmune anemias.","['Mentzer, S J', 'Osteen, R T', 'Starnes, H F', 'Moloney, W C', 'Rosenthal, D', 'Canellos, G', 'Wilson, R E']","['Mentzer SJ', 'Osteen RT', 'Starnes HF', 'Moloney WC', 'Rosenthal D', 'Canellos G', 'Wilson RE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Surg,Annals of surgery,0372354,['0 (Autoantibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoantibodies/analysis', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/physiopathology', '*Splenectomy', 'Splenomegaly/*pathology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000658-198701000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg. 1987 Jan;205(1):13-7. doi: 10.1097/00000658-198701000-00003.,['CA-09280/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1492871,,,,,,

The variation in pI pattern of the intracellular MuLV p30's was dependent on the type of p30 reactive antibody used for immunoprecipitation. Specifically: a p30 spot with pI 6.3 was always precipitated as the major spot with three different antibodies, minor spots with pI 6.0 and 6.6 were variably seen dependent on the antibody used, and an intracellular p30 spot at pI 6.1 was only precipitated with a rat p30 monoclonal antibody but not with monospecific mouse or intact MuLV cross-reacting p30 sera.

One clone, D62, contained two complete Ab-MuLV proviruses and expressed polyprotein P120. The other clone, K49, contained four proviruses: three of them were complete and one represented a deletion mutant. In addition to P120, a new polyprotein, P60, was expressed in this clone. During the processes of reversion and retransformation proviral DNAs were conserved with respect to size and integration site. In contrast to the transformants, expression of Ab-MuLV P120, and in case of clone K49 also of P60, was blocked in revertant lines as a result of loss of transcription of proviral DNA. In retransformants, expression of Ab-MuLV P120 was found in both clones. However, no expression of P60 was detectable in retransformants of K49-derived revertants. Reversion to the nontransformed phenotype was associated with increased cytosine methylation in proviral DNA sequences, whereas in spontaneous retransformants methylation tended to resume control levels. These findings demonstrate regulation of viral oncogene mediated transformation by cytosine methylation and suggest that transcription of proviral DNA is under both viral and cellular control. They furthermore suggest that processes involved in regulation of proviral expression do not affect all such proviruses simultaneously in the same way.","['Roebroek, A J', 'Bloemers, H P', 'van de Ven, W J']","['Roebroek AJ', 'Bloemers HP', 'van de Ven WJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lung', 'Methylation', 'Mink', 'Phenotype', 'RNA/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-1702(86)90053-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(86)90053-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1986 Oct;6(1):15-26. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(86)90053-5.,,,,,,,,

This mutagenic effect was diminished up to 75% when Aza Cyd was tested in the presence of either enzymatically active or heat-denatured 9000 X g supernatant prepared from rat liver homogenate.

Here we show that dephosphorylation of pp60c-src by phosphatase treatment in vitro caused a 10- to 20-fold increase in pp60c-src protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of specific antibody to the region of pp60c-src which contains phosphotyrosine-527 also increased kinase activity. Each treatment increased phosphorylation of added substrates and of Tyr-416 within pp60c-src by a similar mechanism that involved altered interactions with ATP and increased catalytic rate. We suggest that the phosphorylated carboxy terminus acts as an inhibitor of the protein kinase domain of pp60c-src, unless its conformation is altered by either dephosphorylation or antibody binding. The antibody additionally stimulated the phosphorylation of forms of pp60c-src that had reduced gel mobility, much like those phosphorylated in kinase reactions containing pp60c-src activated by polyomavirus medium tumor antigen. These in vitro experiments provide models for the activation of pp60c-src in cells transformed by polyomavirus. We also show that autophosphorylation of pp60c-src at Tyr-527 occurs only to a very limited extent in vitro, even when Tyr-527 is made available for phosphorylation by treatment with phosphatase. This suggests that other protein-tyrosine kinases may normally phosphorylate Tyr-527 and regulate pp60c-src in the cell.","['Cooper, J A', 'King, C S']","['Cooper JA', 'King CS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)', 'Rats', 'Tyrosine']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.6.12.4467-4477.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 Dec;6(12):4467-77. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.12.4467-4477.1986.,['CA-28151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC367230,,,,,,

While transferrin receptor expression in normal T cells is tightly coupled to interleukin-2 receptor expression, transferrin receptor expression in malignant cells is usually constitutive and is released from this constraint. Temporally, the appearance of these membrane receptors is preceded by changes in the expression of the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-myb. In addition, although an increase in the level of intracellular free calcium occurs early in the sequence of T-cell activation, the activation events dependent on this calcium flux have not been resolved. In the present study we report that diltiazem, an ion channel-blocking agent that inhibits calcium influx, arrested the growth in vitro of both normal and malignant human T cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, diltiazem did not inhibit the expression of c-myc or interleukin-2 receptor mRNA and protein in normal mitogen-activated T cells or the constitutive expression of c-myc and c-myb mRNA in malignant T cells (T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells). In contrast, diltiazem prevented the induction of transferrin receptor (mRNA and protein) in normal T cells and caused a progressive loss of transferrin receptor (mRNA and protein) in malignant T cells. These data demonstrate that diltiazem can dissociate several growth-related processes normally occurring in G1 and thereby disrupt the biochemical cascade leading to cell proliferation.","['Neckers, L M', 'Bauer, S', 'McGlennen, R C', 'Trepel, J B', 'Rao, K', 'Greene, W C']","['Neckers LM', 'Bauer S', 'McGlennen RC', 'Trepel JB', 'Rao K', 'Greene WC']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EE92BBP03H (Diltiazem)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Diltiazem/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'RNA/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Transferrin/biosynthesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.6.12.4244-4250.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 Dec;6(12):4244-50. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.12.4244-4250.1986.,,PMC367205,,,,,,

Simultaneous differential staining of p53 vs DNA and p53 vs RNA, followed by bivariate analysis, made it possible to estimate p53 with respect to cell position in the cell cycle and correlate it with RNA (predominantly rRNA) content. The data show that in exponentially growing L1210 cells p53 is being progressively accumulated during the G1, S and G2 phases and that the content of p53 and RNA are highly correlated. In plateau L1210 cultures most cells are arrested in G1, some cells, however, still continue to progress through S and G2. In these cultures the p53 content of all cells, regardless of the phase of the cell cycle, is diminished and the decrease in p53 is more pronounced than that of RNA or total protein content. The normal thymocytes as well as the stimulated lymphocytes show bimodal distribution with respect to p53 expression, compatible with the assumption that the cycling cells have increased expression of this protein related to the G0 cells. Some cycling cells, however, have minimal p53. The quantitative p53 immunofluorescence data were confirmed by the immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis.

The patient was a 24-year-old female with a preceding history of a lupus-erythematosus-like disorder. The presenting symptom of the spinal cord tumor was spastic paresis of the lower extremities. Radiological examinations including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord revealed an intramedullary tumor from levels C2 to T6. A decompressive laminectomy was performed with the pathological diagnosis of poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma with T-cell surface marker. Postoperative cerebrospinal radiation up to 40.5 Gy was performed. The patient is alive without disease 18 months after completion of the therapy. MRI proved to be a very useful method for evaluation of the response to therapy and for follow-up.

Evidence of evolution from the abnormal paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone.,314-7,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which the blood cells demonstrate aberrant interactions with serum complement. In part, this is due to the absence of the complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF). A small number of patients with PNH have gone on to develop acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, which is thought to arise from the injured marrow as a second hematopoietic disorder. We have studied a patient with PNH who developed acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML); the blasts from this patient were found to lack DAF as measured by polyclonal antibody binding and fluorescence flow cytometry as well as by immunoblotting. The blasts from 11 other patients with AML bound anti-DAF antibody in amounts similar to normal mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Cells of the human leukemia cell lines HL-60, K562, U937, and HEL also bound anti-DAF antibody. In addition to DAF deficiency, blasts from the PNH patient had undetectable alkaline phosphatase activity, in contrast to human leukemia cell lines. These data suggest that the leukemic cells of the PNH patient arose out of the PNH clone and that AML in the setting of PNH is not a separate disorder.","['Devine, D V', 'Gluck, W L', 'Rosse, W F', 'Weinberg, J B']","['Devine DV', 'Gluck WL', 'Rosse WF', 'Weinberg JB']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (Complement Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['CD55 Antigens', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Complement Inactivator Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemoglobinuria/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112802 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1987 Jan;79(1):314-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI112802.,['1 R01 AM31379/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC424052,,,,,,

In this way, allospecific clones were obtained both of the T4+T8- and the T4-T8+ phenotype, which included proliferative as well as cytotoxic cells. Within a panel of 20 cytotoxic clones, different specificities for both class I and class II MHC antigens were found. The clones were tested for their reactivities with four additional anti-T-cell receptor antibodies raised against HPB-ALL. Two of these, 1C1 and 1C2, reacted with all 3D6+ clones. By means of two other antibodies, 2D4 and 65, the 3D6+ receptor family could be divided into four structurally distinct subfamilies. Biochemical analysis suggested that the 1C1, 1C2, 2D4, and 3D6 antibodies define epitopes on the beta chain of the receptor. Isoelectric focusing of receptor molecules isolated from cytotoxic clones with different specificites indicated that there are extensive structural differences in both alpha and beta chains of the receptors. No correlation could be found between the antigenic specificity of a clone and the structure of its receptor in this analysis. It is postulated that the 1C1, 1C2, and 3D6 epitopes may be encoded by a particular germline V beta segment, in analogy with similar, previously described findings in both the human and the murine system.","['Borst, J', 'Spits, H', 'Voordouw, A', 'de Vries, E', 'Boylston, A', 'de Vries, J E']","['Borst J', 'Spits H', 'Voordouw A', 'de Vries E', 'Boylston A', 'de Vries JE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0198-8859(86)90302-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(86)90302-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1986 Dec;17(4):426-42. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(86)90302-2.,,,,,,,,

Anti-LFA-1 MoAb has been shown to inhibit both natural killer (NK) and cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) mediated cytolysis. To further define the utilization of this molecule in cell-mediated cytolysis, we used a panel of MoAb to functional epitopes on both the alpha and beta chains of the LFA-1 heterodimer. The panel was used to compare OKT3- NK effectors and OKT3+ CTL clones. As expected, function-associated MoAb to CTL antigens (T3, T8, LFA-2) and target cell antigens (HLA, LFA-3) blocked only CTL clones and not NK effectors. In contrast, anti-LFA-1 MoAb blocked both NK effectors and CTL clones. In addition, the panel of anti-LFA-1 MoAb demonstrated an identical hierarchy of functionally relevant LFA-1 epitopes. Given the similar utilization of LFA-1 in NK and CTL mediated cytotoxicity assays, we explored the ability of MoAb to different epitopes on LFA-1 to inhibit conjugate formation. Anti-LFA-1 MoAb inhibition of NK-target binding paralleled the inhibition of CTL-target binding. Thus, functional epitopes on the LFA-1 molecule have been defined for NK and CTL effectors. The identical hierarchy of functional epitopes indicates that the LFA-1 molecule is similarly utilized in NK and CTL mediated cytotoxicity and that the relevant epitopes are involved in effector-target conjugate formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Mentzer, S J', 'Krensky, A M', 'Burakoff, S J']","['Mentzer SJ', 'Krensky AM', 'Burakoff SJ']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Surface/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/immunology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0198-8859(86)90280-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(86)90280-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1986 Nov;17(3):288-96. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(86)90280-6.,"['AM35008/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09280/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

The characteristics of the Ca2+ channels were typical for the endoplasmic reticulum membrane channel activity. They had a relatively large unit conductance and were modified by typical activators (nucleotides) and inhibitors (ruthenium red, verapamil). Different doses of nifedipine did not inhibit Ca2+ channel activity. A substantial difference between the single-channel properties of the two types of investigated membranes was observed. The mean open time and the open state probability of channels reconstituted in bilayer lipid membranes from the membrane components of cisplatin-resistant cells were larger than those in bilayer lipid membranes made from components of cisplatin-sensitive cells. Ruthenium red (7 X 10(-7) M) inhibited the channel activity in both types of membranes to the same level. The observed effects could be related to an increased Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores (endoplasmic reticulum system) accompanied by an enhanced intracytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in cisplatin-resistant cells. These changes in the Ca2+ concentration level may be responsible for the higher antitumor drug efflux rate and the development of the drug resistance. The suggestion is made that specific inhibitors of the Ca2+ transport across the membranes of the subcellular Ca2+-storing organelles may be tested as agents for overcoming the antitumor drug resistance.","['Vassilev, P M', 'Kanazirska, M P', 'Charamella, L J', 'Dimitrov, N V', 'Tien, H T']","['Vassilev PM', 'Kanazirska MP', 'Charamella LJ', 'Dimitrov NV', 'Tien HT']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '11103-72-3 (Ruthenium Red)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Ion Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Nifedipine/pharmacology', 'Ruthenium Red/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1987/01/15 00:00,1987/01/15 00:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 15;47(2):519-22.,,,,,,,,

We have conducted a clinical trial in which some patients' tumors regressed after infusion of such antibodies. Here, we evaluated characteristics of the antibodies, the tumors, and the patients to determine which features best correlated with the clinical response. Neither the isotype of the murine antibodies, nor their avidity were predictive of clinical outcome. The specific epitope to which the antibodies bound was characterized by immunochemical techniques. Reactivity with a heavy-light chain combinatorial determinant correlated somewhat with clinical effect. Variations in the characteristics of the individual tumors such as antigen sites per cell and ability to modulate the surface immunoglobulin were not predictive of response. In one patient with prolymphocytic leukemia the anti-idiotype antibody had a direct antiproliferative effect on tumor cells in vitro. This patient's tumor response was explainable by such a direct mechanism. In the other patients, who had lymphomas, therapeutic outcome correlated with the number of host nontumor cells infiltrating the tumor. The vast majority of these nontumor cells were mature T lymphocytes of the Leu 4, Leu 3 (T3, T4) phenotype. Thus, a preexistent host-tumor interaction seems to be important in the in vivo effect of anti-idiotype antibodies in B cell tumors.","['Lowder, J N', 'Meeker, T C', 'Campbell, M', 'Garcia, C F', 'Gralow, J', 'Miller, R A', 'Warnke, R', 'Levy, R']","['Lowder JN', 'Meeker TC', 'Campbell M', 'Garcia CF', 'Gralow J', 'Miller RA', 'Warnke R', 'Levy R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76566-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jan;69(1):199-210.,"['CA09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

The experiments included the evaluation of the action of compounds on virus particle-associated reverse transcriptase in exogenous assays, on virus propagation in persistently infected cell cultures and on virus infectivity in mice. In disrupted viruses and in the absence of excess protein, the reverse transcriptase was inhibited by MAP but not by cis-DDP. The same results were obtained when examining the activity of the virus-associated RNA polymerase of influenza virus A/WSN. Both compounds did not inhibit the replication of retroviruses in cell cultures, except at high dose levels which exerted toxic action on both cells and virus formation. The leukemogenicity of Rauscher murine leukemia virus was strongly inhibited when the virus had been incubated with MAP before inoculation. A similar treatment with cis-DDP did not influence viral leukemogenicity.

Probed on human leukemia cell lines, phosphotyrosine antibodies recognized a 210,000-molecular-weight protein (p210) in K562 cells, a cell line derived from a Philadelphia (Ph)'-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but recognized no protein in control Ph'-negative non-CML leukemia cells. The p210 protein was also recognized by antisera against v-abl-encoded polypeptides and displayed kinase activity, phosphorylating itself on tyrosine, in an immunocomplex kinase assay. These data are consistent with reported findings of the expression of a recombined bcr-abl gene in Ph'-positive CML cells, leading to the synthesis of an altered p210c-abl protein endowed with tyrosine kinase activity. Phosphotyrosine antibodies also detected the expression of the p210c-abl protein in fresh bone marrow cells harvested from CML patients in blast crisis. Besides the p210c-abl protein kinase, phosphotyrosine antibodies recognized other proteins with molecular weights of 110,000, 68,000, and 36,000 (p110, p68, and p36) in K562 cells. When [gamma-32P]ATP was added to nonionic detergent-extracted cells, these proteins became phosphorylated on tyrosine, as confirmed by phosphoamino acid analysis. A comparison with fibroblasts transformed by the v-abl, v-src, and v-fps oncogenes suggested the identity of the p36 protein with the common 36-kilodalton protein substrate of viral oncogene-encoded tyrosine kinases. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins is thus a feature shared by cells transformed by v-abl and cells expressing a rearranged bcr-abl gene.","['Naldini, L', 'Stacchini, A', 'Cirillo, D M', 'Aglietta, M', 'Gavosto, F', 'Comoglio, P M']","['Naldini L', 'Stacchini A', 'Cirillo DM', 'Aglietta M', 'Gavosto F', 'Comoglio PM']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/*analysis', 'Reference Values', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.6.5.1803-1811.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 May;6(5):1803-11. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.5.1803-1811.1986.,,PMC367710,,,,,,

A 10-fold maximal induction of both class I surface protein and mRNA occurs at 48 h and is reversible upon withdrawal of IFN-gamma from the culture medium. In vitro nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed to directly establish that IFN-gamma exerts an early effect at the level of transcription, with maximal transcription rates occurring within 4 h. The difference between the time course of transcription induction and that of mRNA accumulation suggests that the regulation of class I gene expression in this human leukemic cell line also involves posttranscriptional mechanisms. Measurements of cell proliferation rates and cell cycle distribution, as well as the reversibility of the effects of IFN-gamma, demonstrate that the selective induction of class I genes in these cells occurs in the absence of differentiation.","['Chen, E', 'Karr, R W', 'Frost, J P', 'Gonwa, T A', 'Ginder, G D']","['Chen E', 'Karr RW', 'Frost JP', 'Gonwa TA', 'Ginder GD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Genes/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*drug effects', 'Poly A/genetics', 'RNA/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.6.5.1698-1705.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 May;6(5):1698-705. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.5.1698-1705.1986.,['AM29904/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC367697,,,,,,

The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits for preparation of antipeptide antisera. These sera were then tested for their ability to neutralize a broad range of FeLV isolates in vitro. Eight peptides elicited neutralizing responses against subtype B isolates. Five of these peptides corresponded to sequences of gp70 and three to p15E. The ability of these antipeptide antisera to neutralize FeLV subtypes A and C varied. In certain circumstances, failure to neutralize a particular isolate corresponded to sequence changes within the corresponding peptide region. However, four antibodies which preferentially neutralized the subtype B viruses were directed to epitopes in common with Sarma subtype C virus. These results suggest that distal changes in certain subtypes (possibly glycosylation differences) alter the availability of certain epitopes in one virus isolate relative to another. We prepared a ""nest"" of overlapping peptides corresponding to one of the neutralizing regions of gp70 and performed slot blot analyses with both antipeptide antibodies and a monoclonal antibody which recognized this epitope. We were able to define a five-amino-acid sequence required for reactivity. Comparisons were made between an anti-synthetic peptide antibody and a monoclonal antibody reactive to this epitope for the ability to bind both peptide and virus, as well as to neutralize virus in vitro. Both the anti-synthetic peptide and the monoclonal antibodies bound peptide and virus to high titers. However, the monoclonal antibody had a 4-fold-higher titer against virus and a 10-fold-higher neutralizing titer than did the anti-synthetic peptide antibody. Competition assays were performed with these two antibodies adjusted to equivalent antivirus titers against intact virions affixed to tissue culture plates.

These observations suggest that autoantibodies may bind to conformational epitopes formed by two separate molecules, and that autoantibodies that cross-react with phosphorylated epitopes in DNA and neural tissue could be involved in autoimmune neurologic diseases.","['Freddo, L', 'Hays, A P', 'Nickerson, K G', 'Spatz, L', 'McGinnis, S', 'Lieberson, R', 'Vedeler, C A', 'Shy, M E', 'Autilio-Gambetti, L', 'Grauss, F C']","['Freddo L', 'Hays AP', 'Nickerson KG', 'Spatz L', 'McGinnis S', 'Lieberson R', 'Vedeler CA', 'Shy ME', 'Autilio-Gambetti L', 'Grauss FC', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Antinuclear/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Gangliosides/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/immunology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myelin Sheath/*immunology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/complications/*immunology', 'Phosphatidic Acids/*immunology']",1986/12/15 00:00,1986/12/15 00:01,['1986/12/15 00:00'],"['1986/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Dec 15;137(12):3821-5.,"['AI07132-10/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS00659/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS18016/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

In the present studies, cord blood cultures demonstrating differentiation of basophils or eosinophils have been maintained for prolonged periods in the presence of conditioned medium from a human T-cell leukemia line (Mo-CM). Peak basophil counts and histamine levels were followed almost invariably by a second peak of eosinophils in vitro. Morphologic examination revealed the consistent presence of cells with mixed basophil-eosinophil granulation. Both basophil and eosinophil growth-stimulating activities were found in Mo-CM, were heat stable and nondialyzable, and could be partially separated from each other by a multistep procedure that included ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Mixing experiments using separated basophil- and eosinophil-stimulating activities revealed that suppression of basophil growth was accompanied by reciprocal enhancement of eosinophil growth, a finding that could be confirmed on analysis of morphology of single colonies from cord blood progenitors in methylcellulose. These studies point to the existence of regulatory growth factors in Mo-CM that stimulate and/or inhibit the growth and differentiation of human basophils and eosinophils from a common, committed progenitor cell.","['Tanno, Y', 'Bienenstock, J', 'Richardson, M', 'Lee, T D', 'Befus, A D', 'Denburg, J A']","['Tanno Y', 'Bienenstock J', 'Richardson M', 'Lee TD', 'Befus AD', 'Denburg JA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Basophils/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eosinophils/*cytology', 'Fetal Blood', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Jan;15(1):24-33.,,,,,,,,

When these cells are briefly exposed to hypertonic growth medium prior to lysis, the resulting post-mitochondrial supernatants show a high in vitro protein-synthesis activity. Amino acid incorporation is linear up to 60 min; more than 80% of this is due to (re)initiation, as shown by the inhibition with edeine. Extracts from induced cells reach only a third of overall incorporation as compared to extracts from uninduced cells. This reduction of the protein-synthesizing capacity is also observed in vivo. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that extracts from uninduced cells faithfully translate their endogenous mRNA, whereas in extracts from induced cells, non-globin protein synthesis is reduced and globin is preferentially synthesized. Haemin (40 microM) as well as purified eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) from rabbit reticulocytes enhance amino acid incorporation in both kinds of extracts, which suggests that both uninduced and induced MEL cells contain a haemin-controlled eIF-2 alpha kinase.

A prerequisite for computer-aided analysis of subtle morphological features is measuring the cells at a high scanning density with high magnification and high numerical aperture optics. Contrary to visual observations, the information content in a measured picture can be increased by setting the condensor's numerical aperture (NA) greater than the objective's NA. The complexity and heterogeneity of such cell images necessitate a new segmentation method that conserves the morphological information required in the subsequent image analysis, feature extraction, and cell classification. In our segmentation strategy, characteristic color difference thresholds for each nucleus and cytoplasm are combined with geometric operations, probability functions, and a cell model. All thresholds are repeatedly recalculated during the successive improvements of the image masks. None of the thresholds are fixed. This strategy segments blood cell images containing touching cells and large variations in staining, texture, size, and shape. Biological inconsistencies in the calculated cell masks are eliminated by comparing each mask with the cell model criteria integrated into the entire segmentation process. All 20,000 leukocyte images from 120 smears in our leukemia project were segmented with this method.","['Harms, H', 'Aus, H M', 'Haucke, M', 'Gunzer, U']","['Harms H', 'Aus HM', 'Haucke M', 'Gunzer U']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,,IM,"['Blood Cells/*cytology', '*Cytological Techniques', '*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', '*Lenses', 'Models, Biological', '*Staining and Labeling']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990070605 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1986 Nov;7(6):522-31. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990070605.,,,,,,,,

PGA1 action was reversible; however, K562 cells totally lost their growth potential after prolonged exposure to PGAs. While it did not significantly affect DNA and RNA synthesis, PGA1 partially inhibited protein synthesis and glycosylation in these cells. In particular, the production of two polypeptides with molecular weights of 92,000 and 46,000, respectively, was decreased, while the synthesis of a protein with a molecular weight of 74,000 was induced.

Thus, natural immunity to FLD-3 cells in vivo differs from that of genetic resistance to normal bone marrow cell allografts, and the lysis of FLD-3 cells in vitro seems to be mediated by cells which do not easily fit into the definition of natural killer (NK) or natural cytotoxic (NC) cells.","['Afifi, M S', 'Bennett, M', 'Kumar, V']","['Afifi MS', 'Bennett M', 'Kumar V']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul,Natural immunity and cell growth regulation,8407979,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Asialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '71012-19-6 (asialo GM1 ganglioside)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', '9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Asialoglycoproteins/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carrageenan/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*G(M1) Ganglioside', 'Glycosphingolipids/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/*radiation effects', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Interferons/immunology/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lung/cytology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/classification', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/blood/genetics', 'Silicon Dioxide/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul. 1986;5(4):200-10.,"['AI20451/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36921/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

The differentiation of these myeloid leukemic cells in vivo is regulated by a cell mediated immune response which requires T lymphocytes. We now show that differentiation of myeloid cells in vivo can be induced by antigen-specific helper T lymphocytes and that this is associated with the ability of the helper T cells to produce myeloid cell differentiation-inducing protein MGI-2. Antigen specific helper T cells can accumulate at a site that contains the antigen. It is suggested that migration in response to antigen of helper T cells producing differentiation factors may play an important role in inducing in vivo differentiation of leukemic cells.,"['Lotem, J', 'Ben-Nun, A', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Ben-Nun A', 'Sachs L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Tuberculin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Epitopes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Tuberculin/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90233-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(10):1165-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90233-x.,,,,,,,,

This antibody, C37 (an IgG1,K) also reacted with a small (2-5%) population of normal peripheral blood T (PBL-T) cells. These C37-positive (C37+) cells were found in both the T4/Leu3+ and T8/Leu2+ subsets. Like OKT3 antibody, C37 induced T-cell mitogenesis with a peak proliferative response at day 3. In long-term cultures containing irradiated autologous feeder cells and IL-2, C37 antibody caused the selective expansion of C37+ T cells. On HPB-ALL cells C37 induced comodulation of the T3 molecule. C37 precipitated a disulfide-linked dimer characteristic of the T-cell antigen receptor consisting of an alpha-subunit (45-48 kD) and a beta-subunit (38-42 kD) from both C37+ T-cell blasts of a normal individual and HPB-ALL cells that were surface radioiodinated. However, the precipitated molecule isolated from C37 antibody-activated T-cell blasts exhibited a different pI from that isolated from HPB-ALL cells. Our studies indicate that C37 recognizes an epitope on the T-cell receptor molecule that is shared by a subpopulation of human T cells, which raises the possibility that multiple variable-region associated and/or framework-like determinants of the T-cell antigen receptor can be defined serologically and used in functional and molecular studies of T-cell subsets.","['Wang, C Y', 'Bushkin, Y', 'Pica, R', 'Lane, C', 'McGrath, H', 'Posnett, D N']","['Wang CY', 'Bushkin Y', 'Pica R', 'Lane C', 'McGrath H', 'Posnett DN']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hybridoma,Hybridoma,8202424,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification/immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hyb.1986.5.179 [doi]'],ppublish,Hybridoma. 1986 Fall;5(3):179-90. doi: 10.1089/hyb.1986.5.179.,"['AI-18321/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-21479/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

GH is always the first pituitary hormone to be affected by radiation damage to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis but larger radiation doses may result in panhypopituitarism. Some children retain normal GH responses to certain provocative stimuli, although physiological GH secretion is reduced. Nonetheless, in children suspected of radiation-induced GH deficiency, pharmacological tests of GH secretion remain useful, the ITT being the test of choice because of the marked radiation sensitivity of the GH response to hypoglycaemia. The hypothalamus is more radiosensitive than the pituitary. In many patients with radiation-induced GH deficiency, the damage appears to be at the hypothalamic level resulting in a deficiency of endogenous GRF. Treatment with synthetic GRF may provide an alternative to GH therapy in such children.

Third, specimens from previously untreated patients were significantly more sensitive to the most important drugs than were specimens from patients who had previously received chemotherapy. Finally, metachronous assays performed on specimens from the same patients showed little change in chemosensitivity if there had been no intervening chemotherapy between the times that the first and second assays were performed. However, if the patients had received intervening chemotherapy between the times of the first and second assays, the specimens in the second assays tended to be significantly more resistant than were the specimens in the first assays.

Two concentrations of MTX, 0.02 microM and 0.2 microM have been utilized, which can be maintained in vivo during many hours in the maintenance therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The results are correlated with the effects of MTX on the inhibition of purine de novo synthesis. Treatment with 0.02 microM MTX results in an accumulation of cells in early S phase after 20 hr, as measured by DNA flow cytometry and by a significant increase of dCTP levels, followed by a slow progression of a cohort of cells through the cell cycle. Cytotoxicity also becomes evident starting from this point of time. The effects on deoxyribonucleotide pools are discussed in correlation with the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The changes in ribonucleotide pools are associated with the partial inhibition of purine de novo synthesis at 20-28 hr and suggest an inhibition of RNA synthesis. After 48 hr a reutilization of nucleotide precursors due to nucleic acid breakdown and a recovery of purine de novo synthesis is shown, associated with a recovery of RNA synthesis, whereas cytotoxicity increases. Treatment of MOLT-4 cells with 0.2 microM MTX results in a rapid complete cessation of cell progression through all parts of the cell cycle after 8 hr, associated with a depletion of all deoxyribonucleotide pools, complete inhibition of purine de novo synthesis, inhibition of RNA synthesis and a marked cytotoxicity. Ribonucleotide pools demonstrate a reutilization of nucleotide precursors after 12 hr of incubation without a recovery of purine de novo synthesis and RNA synthesis. These data show a close dose- and time-dependent correlation of the effects of MTX on purine de novo synthesis, UMP levels and other (deoxy)ribonucleotide pools, and on RNA and DNA synthesis in MOLT-4 cells having an active purine de novo synthesis. This correlation is absent in normal bone marrow cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. These data can be used in order to elucidate the synergistic effects of sequential administration of MTX and 6-mercaptopurine.","['Bokkerink, J P', 'De Abreu, R A', 'Bakker, M A', 'Hulscher, T W', 'Van Baal, J M', 'De Vaan, G A']","['Bokkerink JP', 'De Abreu RA', 'Bakker MA', 'Hulscher TW', 'Van Baal JM', 'De Vaan GA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleotides)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Purine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors']",1986/10/15 00:00,1986/10/15 00:01,['1986/10/15 00:00'],"['1986/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(86)90626-X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(86)90626-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1986 Oct 15;35(20):3557-64. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(86)90626-x.,,,,,,,,

On the basis of their biochemical effects on cell metabolism, a sequence-dependent synergism might be anticipated. In order to investigate this hypothesis, MOLT-4 human malignant T-lymphoblasts were incubated with various concentrations of MTX. The time at which maximal increase of intracellular 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) levels was found correlated with the concentrations of MTX used. Determination of aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleoside monophosphate (AICAR) levels and labeled glycine incorporation into purine metabolites revealed an incomplete inhibition of purine de novo synthesis after incubation with 0.02 microM MTX, and a complete inhibition with 0.2 microM MTX. After prolonged periods of incubation, glutamine exhaustion of the medium caused inhibition of purine de novo synthesis in MTX-untreated cells, with a concomitant increase of PRPP levels. Addition of glutamine to the medium prevented this phenomenon. The increased availability of PRPP after pretreatment with MTX can be used for enhanced intracellular incorporation of hypoxanthine and 6MP in their respective nucleotides. The time- and dose-dependent effects of MTX on PRPP levels correlated with the enhanced incorporation of hypoxanthine and 6MP. The data presented in this study demonstrate that a synergistic action of the combination of MTX and 6MP can be anticipated in malignant lymphoblasts with an active purine de novo synthesis depending on the concentration of MTX and on the time and sequence of administration of both drugs.","['Bokkerink, J P', 'Bakker, M A', 'Hulscher, T W', 'De Abreu, R R', 'Schretlen, E D', 'van Laarhoven, J P', 'De Bruyn, C H']","['Bokkerink JP', 'Bakker MA', 'Hulscher TW', 'De Abreu RR', 'Schretlen ED', 'van Laarhoven JP', 'De Bruyn CH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '7540-64-9 (Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Glycine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate/metabolism', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1986/10/15 00:00,1986/10/15 00:01,['1986/10/15 00:00'],"['1986/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(86)90625-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(86)90625-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1986 Oct 15;35(20):3549-55. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(86)90625-8.,,,['Biochem Pharmacol 1987 Mar 1;36(1):781'],,,,,

When cells were continuously exposed to each agent for 7 days, Ara-C was the most inhibitory, DAZ slightly less effective and AAC the least inhibitory on a molar basis. HL-60/Ara-C were also highly cross-resistant to both DAZ and AAC. In the absence of deoxycytidine, all three agents were either equally inhibitory or slightly more inhibitory to the growth of CFU-GM than to HL-60, whereas administration of deoxycytidine in ten to one-hundred fold excess protected CFU-GM to a greater extent than HL-60. In contrast, administration of high concentrations of drugs, e.g. 10(-5)-10(-4) M, in conjunction with excess deoxycytidine exhibited greater toxicity toward CFU-GM than toward HL-60/Ara-C. Coadministration of deoxycytidine in ten-fold excess reduced the total intracellular accumulation and DNA incorporation of each analog in HL-60 cells by approx. 50%, whereas a hundred fold excess was associated with greater than a 90% reduction in these values. These studies demonstrate that deoxycytidine may antagonize the effects of Ara-C, DAZ and AAC in both normal and leukemic human myeloid cells, and that at low drug concentrations the degree of protection may be greater for normal elements. However, regimens employing high drug concentrations in conjunction with deoxycytidine do not appear to exert a selective inhibitory effect toward a highly resistant leukemic subvariant. These data suggest that alternative deoxycytidine/deoxycytidine analog dose relationships and schedules must be sought which are capable of selectively eradicating resistant cells.","['Grant, S', 'Bhalla, K', 'Gleyzer, M']","['Grant S', 'Bhalla K', 'Gleyzer M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '5V71D8JOKK (fazarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Decitabine', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90059-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(9):1139-46. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90059-7.,['CA-35601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Interest in these compounds stemmed from their relationship to MTX gamma-polyglutamates, from which they differ only in lacking ""internal"" alpha-carboxyl groups. The ability of the MeAPA-Gabn-Glu derivatives to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS) in vitro and to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in culture was evaluated. The IC50 for DHFR inhibition increased progressively from 0.082 to 0.84 microM as the number of Gab spacers was varied from one to five. At the same time the introduction of Gab spacers was found to produce substantial TS inhibition (Ki 0.1-0.4 microM) similar to that reported for MTX polyglutamates. Despite the activity of the MeAPA-Gabn-Glu derivatives as combined inhibitors of TS and DHFR, there was a steep loss of cell growth inhibitory potency as the number of Gab spacers was increased. This most likely reflects low cell uptake and the fact that when n greater than 1 there is almost total abolition of substrate activity for folylpolyglutamate synthetase, which had previously been observed with n = 1.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Forsch, R A', 'Freisheim, J H', 'Danenberg, P V', 'Moran, R G', 'Wick, M M']","['Rosowsky A', 'Forsch RA', 'Freisheim JH', 'Danenberg PV', 'Moran RG', 'Wick MM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Peptide Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00160a014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1986 Oct;29(10):1872-6. doi: 10.1021/jm00160a014.,"['CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30897/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

The single channel conductance at room temperature increased from 2-3 pS at 2.8 mM external K+ to 26 pS at 130 mM K+. This conductance, which appeared to determine the resting potential, could be blocked by Na+ and Ba2+ in a voltage-dependent manner. Rat peritoneal mast cells had a whole-cell conductance of only 10-30 pS, and the resting potential was close to zero. Sometimes discrete openings of channels were observed in the whole-cell configuration. When the Ca2+ concentration on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane was elevated, two types of channels with poor ion specificity appeared. A cation channel, observed at a Ca2+ concentration of approximately 1 microM, had a unit conductance of 30 pS. The other channel, activated at several hundred micromolar Ca2+, was anion selective and had a unit conductance of approximately 380 pS in normal Ringer solution and a bell-shaped voltage dependence.

The sequence of peptide designated SP-65 was identical to the predicted C-terminal 12 residues of the transmembrane protein p21env, and peptide SP-74 was inferred from a region shown to be highly conserved among mammalian retroviruses. The third peptide, SP-70, was derived from a C-terminal region of the surface glycoprotein gp46. Antibodies to each peptide were raised in rabbits and were used to identify and further characterize the proteins coded by the env gene. Despite being present at very low levels in purified viral preparations, these proteins were chromatographed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and were located by Western blot analysis of the column fractions. Anti-SP-70 recognized the surface glycoprotein (gp46) and also its C-terminal cleavage fragment (gp16). Anti-SP-65 and anti-SP-74 both reacted with the hydrophobic transmembrane protein (p21) and provided evidence that this protein does not undergo apparent C-terminal processing during viral maturation, unlike the trans-membrane protein of murine leukemia virus. As expected, anti-SP-74 also reacted with homologous proteins from other Type C and Type D viruses, confirming that peptide SP-74 corresponds to a broadly conserved region of retroviral transmembrane proteins. SP-70, which is predicted to be quite near the C terminus of the major surface glycoprotein, was also reactive with sera of HTLV-I-positive patients, indicating that this peptide corresponds to, or is part of, a native epitope recognized by the natural host.","['Copeland, T D', 'Tsai, W P', 'Kim, Y D', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Copeland TD', 'Tsai WP', 'Kim YD', 'Oroszlan S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Solubility', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Nov 1;137(9):2945-51.,['N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The injection of 10(6) ESb-D cells ip did not establish lethal tumors in untreated DBA/2 mice but established tumors in sublethally irradiated mice. Injection of ESb-D cells into otherwise untreated DBA/2 mice established also a state of protective immunity against the subsequent injection of otherwise lethal doses of ESb tumor cells. Protection was only obtained after injection of intact but not UV-irradiated or mitomycin-C-treated ESb-D cells. A direct T-cell-mediated cytotoxic activity was also demonstrable in the spleen cells of DBA/2 mice after injection of ESb-D cells but not ESb cells. The cytotoxic activity was variant specific for ESb-D target cells, and it was induced only with intact but not UV-irradiated or mitomycin C-treated ESb-D cells. This suggested that the induction of protective and cytotoxic immunity may require the persistence of the antigen or unusually high antigen doses. The in vivo priming for a secondary in vitro cytotoxic response, in contrast, was achieved with intact and also with mitomycin C-treated ESb-D cells but again not with UV-irradiated ESb-D cells. This indicated that the metabolic activity was a minimal requirement for the in vivo immunogenicity of the ESb-D tumor line. The secondary cytotoxic activity was demonstrable on ESb-D and ESb target cells and could be restimulated in vitro about equally well with ESb-D and ESb cells. But the in vivo priming was again only obtained with ESb-D cells and not with ESb cells. These experiments thus demonstrated that the requirements for immunogenicity are more stringent in vivo than in vitro, and more stringent for the induction of direct cytotoxic and protective immunity in vivo than for the in vivo priming for secondary in vitro responses.","['Wehrmaker, A', 'Lehmann, V', 'Droge, W']","['Wehrmaker A', 'Lehmann V', 'Droge W']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(86)90142-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(86)90142-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1986 Sep;101(2):290-8. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(86)90142-5.,,,,,,,,

In viable cells this dye also accumulates in mitochondria. The cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of PY on L1210 and Chinese hamster ovary cells were studied in relation to its intracellular localization and compared with the affinity of PY to bind to double-stranded DNA and RNA and its propensity to condense single-stranded DNA and RNA. Antitumor properties of PY were tested on L1210 leukemia and Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice. At a concentration of 1.7 to 3.3 microM, PY was localized almost exclusively in mitochondria of cultured cells, similar to another mitochondrial probe, rhodamine 123. At that concentration PY was not toxic but suppressed cell growth, arresting cells in G1. At a concentration of 6.7 to 33.0 microM, PY was also localized in nucleoli and uniformly in cytoplasm, bound to the RNase-sensitive material therein. At that high concentration PY induced cell arrest in G2 and S and was cytotoxic. The dye exhibited a propensity to bind and condense (precipitate) single-stranded nucleic acids, and condensation could be measured by the appearance of light-scattering products. Among a variety of natural and synthetic nucleic acids the most sensitive were the RNA polymer, polyriboadenylate, and the copolymer, polyriboadenylate and polyriboguanylate, which underwent condensation at a PY concentration of 6.6 to 10.0 microM. Natural and synthetic DNA polymers were resistant to condensation. The data suggest that the cytostatic (G2 and S arrest) and cytotoxic (inability to exclude trypan blue, loss of clonogenicity) effects of PY seen at 6.7 to 33.0 microM concentration may be a consequence of the dye binding to RNA. PY may intercalate to double-stranded RNA and/or cause the specific condensation of single-stranded RNA; the polyadenylated sections of mRNA appear to be the most sensitive cellular targets to undergo condensation. PY showed antitumor properties extending survival of L1210 leukemic mice by 50% and slowing growth of Sarcoma 180 ascites tumor. The possibility that certain antitumor drugs, generally believed to act via intercalation to DNA, may exert chemotherapeutic effects via their interactions with RNA is discussed.","['Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Kapuscinski, J', 'Carter, S P', 'Schmid, F A', 'Melamed, M R']","['Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Kapuscinski J', 'Carter SP', 'Schmid FA', 'Melamed MR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'W659G165T1 (Pyronine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Pyronine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA/drug effects', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Solubility', 'Xanthenes/*pharmacology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Nov;46(11):5760-6.,"['CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

While both compounds have been shown to inhibit DNA methylation, a direct comparison of their effects on DNA structure has not previously been reported. Exposure of L1210 cells to H2-aza-Cyd (1-100 micrograms/ml) and simultaneous labeling with [14C]thymidine for 24 h resulted in the production of single-strand breaks in DNA, which were significantly repaired when cells were incubated in drug-free medium for an additional 24 h. This differed from our previous findings for aza-dCyd, confirmed here in parallel experiments, which showed that this compound produces alkali-labile lesions that persist for 48 h. The DNA effects of both drugs were significantly reduced when cells were prelabeled with [14C]thymidine, indicating that production of DNA lesions requires incorporation of the anomalous base. Studies utilizing pulse-labeled DNA indicated that aza-dCyd has little effect on the rate of DNA elongation, whereas H2-aza-Cyd produced a complete inhibition for at least 6 h after drug removal. The contrasting pattern of DNA damage induced by these compounds in L1210 was also observed in two human lymphoblastoid cells lines, one of which was derived from a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum. We had previously concluded that alkali-labile sites in DNA from aza-dCyd-treated cells probably arise due to the chemical instability of aza-dCyd.

The IgE-receptor complexes are mobile throughout the range of temperatures of 5-38 degrees C. The residual anisotropy does not reach zero, indicating that the rotational diffusion is hindered. The values of rotational correlation times for each temperature are consistent with dispersed receptors rotating freely in the cell membrane and rule out any significant aggregation of occupied receptors before cross-linking by antigen or anti-IgE antibodies. The rotational correlation times decrease with increasing temperature from 65 microseconds at 5.5 degrees C to 23 microseconds at 38 degrees C. However, the degree of orientational constraint experienced by the probe is unchanged. Thus, the temperature dependence can be attributed primarily to a change in the effective viscosity of the cellular plasma membrane.

At the same time we studied the antigenic characteristics of the circulating blast cells from the same patients using in addition one non-complement fixing antibody (BI.3C5) with standard immunofluorescence and immunoalkaline phosphatase techniques. We also used myeloid progenitor cell assays in conjunction with cytotoxic McAbs to investigate the antigenic determinants on Day 7 CFU-GM, Day 14 CFU-GM and BFU-E from the blood of patients with CGL in chronic phase (CP) and from normal bone marrow. We found that two of the McAbs, S4-7 and WGHS29.1, recognized a higher proportion of CFU-L from the blood of AML patients than from patients with CGL-BT. However, the patterns of reactivity for CFU-L from CGL-BT and AML patients with the other McAbs quite closely resembled those observed in CFU-GM and BFU-E from normal individuals and patients with CGL in CP. A McAb with DR specificity and one of the myeloid McAbs, 54/39, recognized both CFU-L from CGL-BT and AML and reacted also with circulating blast cells from the same patients. In contrast, six of the other myeloid McAbs that recognized CFU-L failed to label the corresponding blast cells. We conclude that the antigenic properties of CFU-L in CGL-BT and AML are very similar to, but perhaps not identical with, those of normal CFU-GM and BFU-E.

In order to test the usefulness of this antibody in classifying acute leukemias and to investigate the spectrum of its positivity on B5 and/or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, a variety of benign and neoplastic hematopoietic and lymphoid disorders were studied, using Leu-M1 and the ABC immunoperoxidase technic. Definite positivity in neoplastic cells was present in 4 of 16 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, 0 of 9 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemias/lymphoblastic lymphoma, 11 of 13 patients with Hodgkin's disease, and 0 of 18 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Granulocyte staining could be identified in many cases. Although not identified in tonsillar sections from three patients, variable numbers of sometimes large mononuclear and rare binucleate cells were identified in some of the 14 reactive lymph nodes studied as well. These data, together with other data recently reported, suggest that in routinely processed tissue sections, Leu-M1 is a relatively sensitive marker for Hodgkin's disease, but it does not appear to be specific for that diagnosis.

The 50B4 antigen purified either from a B lymphoblastoid cell line or a leukemic cell line, at a concn ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 micrograms protein/ml, could block the binding of either F10-44-2 and F-10-62-1 (a related antibody) or A1G3 and A3D8 antibodies to human leukemic cells. All of these antibodies immunoprecipitated, from the purified antigenic preparation, a single glycosylated polypeptide chain of apparent mol. wt 85,000. Competitive binding studies indicated that these antibodies define at least three epitopes. The F10-44-2 and A3D8 antibodies blocked the reactivity of monoclonal 50E6-IgG with human leukemic cells and thus bind to an epitope identical or spatially related to the 50E6 epitope. Antibody F10-62-1 competed for the binding of 50B4-IgG to leukemic cells and thus recognizes the 50B4-like epitope. The A1G3 antibody blocked 30% of the binding of 50E6-IgG but did not inhibit the binding of 50B4-IgG: it is thus reacting with a third epitope on the p85 glycoprotein distinct from but close to the 50E6 epitope.","['Letarte, M']",['Letarte M'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(86)90101-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1986 Jun;23(6):639-44. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(86)90101-x.,,,,,,,,

A third (50-kDa) protein, related to reverse transcriptase, was also precipitated. Bacterial extracts of clones expressing reverse transcriptase and endonuclease sequences competed with the viral 80- and 46-kDa proteins, respectively. These results demonstrate that the antisera are specific for viral reverse transcriptase and endonuclease.

The same dose of purified gp70 still protected about 80% of the animals, while p15E did not affect the cumulative mortality. The internal viral polypeptide p30 was ineffective. Serological examination indicated that immunity against death from leukaemia was mediated by specific antibodies. These leukaemia-preventing antibodies were predominantly induced by immunization with the gp70 env gene product, since p15E showed only minor protection. Glycoprotein gp70, however, was more effective when given as the gp85 micellar complex. An even more potent vaccine was obtained when gp70 was coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) by glutaraldehyde. Ten micrograms gp70 coupled to KLH was enough to save more than 90% of Friend leukaemia virus-infected mice from erythroleukaemia.

There was no hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, increase in cytosol calcium concentration (calcium signal), or secretion upon antigen stimulation at temperatures below 20 degrees C. At higher temperatures (i.e., 20 to 37 degrees C), all responses increased in extent with increase in temperature. Temperatures of 38 degrees C or higher, however, resulted in a marked decline in all responses, until no responses were observed at 40 to 42 degrees C. As indicated by the decay in calcium signal, the duration of response was also temperature dependent. The response was of long duration at 30 to 32 degrees C, but it became progressively more transient as the temperature was increased from 32 to 40 degrees C. The effects of low or high temperature were fully reversible. For example, in the presence of antigen, stimulatory signals immediately appeared once the temperature was decreased from 40 to 37 degrees C. Although the diminished responses could be explained, in part, by a reduction in rates of IgE receptor aggregation and phospholipase C activity, the reductions were insufficient to account for complete loss of activity at 40 degrees C. We conclude that generation of intracellular signals in 2H3 cells is blocked by quite small elevations in temperature above 37 degrees C, possibly as consequence of changes in membrane fluidity.","['WoldeMussie, E', 'Maeyama, K', 'Beaven, M A']","['WoldeMussie E', 'Maeyama K', 'Beaven MA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*analysis', 'Histamine Release', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrolysis', 'Intracellular Fluid/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Type C Phospholipases/analysis']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Sep 1;137(5):1674-80.,,,,,,,,

Initial information relative to carbohydrate moieties of DAF was obtained by enzymatic digestions. The 74,000 Mr erythrocyte DAF was lowered 3000 by endoglycosidase F, whereas endoglycosidase H had no effect, indicating one N-linked complex-type unit. Treatment with endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase to remove O-linked oligosaccharides resulted in a 48,000 Mr molecule (67% of the Mr shift being due to sialic acid), which decreased to 45,000 Mr after sequential endoglycosidase F treatment. To additionally define the oligosaccharide structure and identify precursors in biosynthetic pathways, DAF was studied in the HL-60 cell line differentiated by vitamin D toward monocytes. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine revealed a precursor species of 43,000 Mr that underwent an early post-translational modification to a 46,000 Mr intermediate, and subsequently was chased into a mature species of 80,000 Mr that aligned with 125I surface-labeled DAF from these cells. All three forms of DAF were approximately 3000 lower in Mr in the presence of tunicamycin. The two lower Mr DAF species were sensitive to endoglycosidases F and H but not to neuraminidase or endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. In summary, DAF is synthesized as a 43,000 Mr precursor species containing one N-linked high-mannose unit. Before entering the central region of the Golgi, it is converted to a 46,000 Mr species by an as yet unknown post-translational modification. The 46,000 Mr form is converted to the 74,000 Mr (erythrocyte) or 80,000 Mr (leukocyte) membrane form of DAF by the addition of multiple, sialylated O-linked oligosaccharide chains (responsible for the large electrophoretic mobility shift) and conversion of the single N-linked high-mannose unit to a complex-type structure. The cell-specific Mr variation between red and white blood cells arises during this post-translational modification from the 46,000 Mr biosynthetic intermediate to the mature DAF species expressed on the cell surface.","['Lublin, D M', 'Krsek-Staples, J', 'Pangburn, M K', 'Atkinson, J P']","['Lublin DM', 'Krsek-Staples J', 'Pangburn MK', 'Atkinson JP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'CD55 Antigens', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Sep 1;137(5):1629-35.,"['AM07279/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM35081/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

We investigated intracellular enzyme pathways triggered by phorbol stimulation using an EL4 cell line which responds to PMA with IL-2 synthesis (EL4r) and one which does not produce IL-2 following stimulation (EL4nr). By comparing these two cell lines we hoped to establish which enzyme activities were associated with IL-2 synthesis. The enzyme pathways studied included calcium/phospholipid dependent protein kinase (C-kinase) activity, the induction of polyamine synthesis, RNA, DNA and protein synthesis and finally IL-2 production. Our results indicate that both EL4 cell lines have a receptor for PMA, which can activate the C-kinase enzyme. Further, in both cell lines PMA activates the nuclear synthesis of polyamines as demonstrated by ornithine decarboxylase induction. Both RNA and protein synthesis measured by 3H-uridine and 3H-leucine uptake respectively appear comparable between EL4r and EL4nr. The only difference in cellular responsiveness between EL4r and EL4nr was in the 3H-thymidine uptake, and IL-2 production. IL-2 production or lack of production was established by 3H-uridine and 3H-thymidine incorporation as well as viable cell count using the IL-2 dependent cell line CTLL-2. We, therefore, conclude that EL4r and EL4nr cells show similar intracellular responses to phorbol ester except for 3H-thymidine uptake and detectable IL-2 production. Our results suggest that failure of PMA-stimulated EL4nr cells to produce IL-2 is either due to inability of this cell line to synthesize IL-2 or the production of defective IL-2. It is not due to failure of PMA to activate C-kinase or the subsequent nuclear events.","['Fidelus, R K', 'Laughter, A H']","['Fidelus RK', 'Laughter AH']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acids/metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08820138609094139 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Invest. 1986 Apr;15(2):139-48. doi: 10.3109/08820138609094139.,['AI 21995/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The quantity of TL expressed on thymocytes is also influenced by the Tla region; three quantitative phenotypes were identified: high (Tlaa, Tlad, Tlae), intermediate (Tlac, Tlaf), and low (Tlab). (Relative amounts: 1000: 100: 1.) Some thymic leukemias arising in (Tlab, Tlac) mice with genetically determined reduced levels of thymic TL were found to express TL molecules which were structurally indistinguishable from TL isolated from thymocytes but were present in larger amounts.

Eleven of the 17 patients had received prior chemotherapy. Patients were treated with 60Co gamma rays or 6 MV photons. The fraction size ranged from 15 to 100 rad and the total dose per treatment course from 15 to 650 rad, with the exception of one patient who received 1650 rad. Fourteen of 19 courses (71%) given for splenic pain yielded significant subjective relief while 17 of 26 courses given for splenomegaly obtained at least 50% regression of splenic size. Blood counts were carefully monitored before each treatment to limit hematologic toxicity. From this experience, the authors conclude that splenic irradiation effectively palliates splenic pain and reverses splenomegaly in the majority of patients with CML and MMM. Intermittent fractionation (twice or thrice weekly) is more convenient for the patient, appears to be as effective as daily treatment, and may be associated with less hematologic toxicity.

Patients with normal BM, anemias, MDS and acute leukemia at diagnosis had tritiated thymidine labeling index (LI) and most with MDS and AL had also evaluable cytogenetics performed on the same BM sample used for FCM. In normal BM, median aliquot of cells with PI-DNA content intermediate between the diploid and the tetraploid value (2n-4n cells %) was 15.7. The ratio between the fluorescence intensity of the G0/1 peak of normal BM cells and the fluorescence intensity of the G0/1 peak of the reference standard (FI ratio) ranged from 93 to 1.05 (mean +/- 2SD). The 2n-4n cell % was higher than normal in anemias (p less than .001), lower in leukemias (p less than .001) and widely scattered in MDS. A linear correlation was found between 2n-4n cell % and LI, with 2n-4n cell % value higher than LI. The FI ratio was lower than normal in anemias (p less than .05), higher in AL with normal cytogenetics (p less than .02) and broadly scattered in MDS with normal cytogenetics. From our experience, PI-DNA-FCM is a simple and adequate method to evaluate proliferative activity in hematologic diseases. Nevertheless, caution must be taken in attributing small changes in FI ratio to aneuploidy, since they are found in anemias and in MDS and AL with normal cytogenetics, possibly due to differences in PI uptake by different cell types.","['Riccardi, A', 'Montecucco, C M', 'Danova, M', 'Ucci, G', 'Mazzini, G', 'Giordano, P A', 'Pasquali, F']","['Riccardi A', 'Montecucco CM', 'Danova M', 'Ucci G', 'Mazzini G', 'Giordano PA', 'Pasquali F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Basic Appl Histochem,Basic and applied histochemistry,7910664,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', '*Ploidies', 'Propidium', 'Staining and Labeling']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Basic Appl Histochem. 1986;30(2):181-92.,,,,,,,,

Antiserum raised against the P140gag-fps transforming protein of Fujinami avian sarcoma virus specifically recognized a 92,000-Mr protein in human and mouse hematopoietic cells which was closely related in structure to Snyder-Theilen feline sarcoma virus P87gag-fes. This polypeptide was apparently the product of the human c-fes gene and was therefore designated p92c-fes. Human p92c-fes was associated with a tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in vitro and was capable of both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of enolase as an exogenous protein substrate. The synthesis of human and mouse p92c-fes was largely, though not entirely, confined to myeloid cells. p92c-fes was expressed to relatively high levels in a multipotential murine myeloid cell line, in more mature human and mouse granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and in differentiated macrophage like cells as well as in the mononuclear fraction of normal and leukemic human peripheral blood. p92c-fes was not found in erythroid cells, with the exception of a human erythroleukemia line which retains the capacity to differentiate into macrophage like cells. These results suggest a normal role for the p92c-fes tyrosine kinase in hematopoiesis, particularly in granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. In addition, a distinct 94,000-Mr polypeptide, antigenically related to p92c-fes, was identified in a number of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic human and mouse cells and was also found to be associated with a tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity.","['MacDonald, I', 'Levy, J', 'Pawson, T']","['MacDonald I', 'Levy J', 'Pawson T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.5.10.2543-2551.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1985 Oct;5(10):2543-51. doi: 10.1128/mcb.5.10.2543-2551.1985.,,PMC366988,,,,,,

Comparison of aminopterin with methotrexate showed that the methylation of the N10-position (methotrexate) increased the inhibitory effect of aminopterin on TMPS. In contrast, alkylation of the 10-position of 10-deazaaminopterin decreased inhibition of TMPS, and the 50% inhibitory concentration values were progressively higher, in the order 10,10-dimethyl-, 10-methyl-, and 10-ethyl-derivatives. The addition of gamma-glutamyl moieties to both 10-deazaaminopterin, and one of its alkylated analogs, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, enhanced inhibition. The maximum inhibition was achieved with the addition of three glutamyl moieties to 10-deazaaminopterin and two glutamyl moieties to 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, respectively. Thus, 10-deazaaminopterin-tetraglutamate was 138-fold and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin-triglutamate was greater than 51-fold more active than their respective parental compound. The compounds 10-deazaaminopterin and its polyglutamates, 10-methyl- and 10,10-dimethyl-analogs, inhibited TMPS in a noncompetitive fashion with respect to 5,10-methylene-tetrahydropteroylglutamate. Ki values for the monoglutamates were 220 microM, 310 microM, and 225 microM, respectively. In contrast, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin and its polyglutamates inhibited TMPS in a competitive fashion with a Ki value of 410 microM for the monoglutamate. With 5,10-methylene-tetrahydropteroylpentaglutamate as a substrate, 10-deazaaminopterin and its polyglutamates behaved as mixed type inhibitors, and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, monoglutamate and diglutamate, behaved as noncompetitive inhibitors, whereas its pentaglutamate behaved as a mixed-type inhibitor. These results suggest that the addition of gamma-glutamyl moieties to the substrate also caused the change in the mode of inhibitory action of these compounds. These findings also show that both replacement of the N10-position of the 4-aminopteroyl structure with a methylene group and its alkylation caused interesting and unexpected changes in the structure-activity relationships and the mode of action for these 4-aminopteroyl antifolates as inhibitors of TMPS, which may be therapeutically relevant.","['Ueda, T', 'Dutschman, G E', 'Nair, M G', 'Degraw, J I', 'Sirotnak, F M', 'Cheng, Y C']","['Ueda T', 'Dutschman GE', 'Nair MG', 'Degraw JI', 'Sirotnak FM', 'Cheng YC']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Peptides)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'PXJ16PPE04 (10-deazaaminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Methylation', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1986 Aug;30(2):149-53.,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

The Rat-1 cells expressing EBNA2 remained contact inhibited, anchorage dependent, and nontumorigenic in nude mice. Different EBV isolates have one of at least two EBNA2 alleles. Despite divergence between the two alleles, a human serum recognized the prototype EBNA2 allele (EBNA2A) as well as the variant EBNA2B allele characteristic of some Burkitt tumor EBV isolates. The EBNA2B allele was also expressed from the MuLV-derived vector. The reproducible expression of EBNA2A or EBNA2B from these recombinant vectors will facilitate analysis of the EBNA2A and EBNA2B phenotypes.","['Dambaugh, T', 'Wang, F', 'Hennessy, K', 'Woodland, E', 'Rickinson, A', 'Kieff, E']","['Dambaugh T', 'Wang F', 'Hennessy K', 'Woodland E', 'Rickinson A', 'Kieff E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Epitopes', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.59.2.453-462.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Aug;59(2):453-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.59.2.453-462.1986.,"['AI-07099/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC253096,,,,,,

Previous studies indicated that BCL1 tumor immunity in C.B-20 mice was associated with a T cell-mediated immune response against H-40, a minor histocompatibility (H) antigen controlled by a gene linked to the Igh locus. However, we observed that BCL1 leukemia grew progressively in BAB-14 (Igha/b) mice, a strain capable of generating an anti-H-40 immune response. This suggested that anti-H-40 immunity was insufficient for protection and implied that an Igh-V (variable) region gene product was also important for BCL1 growth inhibition. We therefore evaluated the role of two possible Igh-V region-linked gene products in BCL1 growth inhibition; namely, an Igh-V region-linked minor H antigen or alternatively the BCL1 IgM idiotype (Id). We could find no evidence for an Igh-V region-linked minor H antigen because immunosuppressed (500 R) CB-20 mice reconstituted with C.B-20 anti-BAB-14 splenocytes were susceptible to BCL1 growth, whereas recipients reconstituted with C.B-20 anti-BALB/c splenocytes were resistant to BCL1 challenge. In contrast, C.B-20 mice immunized against purified BCL1 IgM protein could adoptively confer BCL1 tumor immunity. C.B-20 mice immunized against other BALB/c IgM myeloma proteins containing either lambda or kappa light chains failed to protect C.B-20 mice suggesting that recognition of a unique determinant (Id) and not an allotype was crucial for tumor immunity. The BCL1 mu-chain appeared to make the major contribution to the idiotypic determinant because a hybridoma product composed of BCL1 mu-chains and BALB/c kappa-chains still elicited BCL1 immunity. Adoptive transfer of C.B-20 anti-BCL1 Id splenocytes into irradiated recipients that prevented an anti-H-40 response due to H-40 tissue expression failed to adoptively confer BCL1 immunity. Thus, these data suggest that BCL1 growth inhibition requires a T cell-mediated response against both H-40 and the BCL1 Id; these responses must be elicited concurrently in the tumor-bearing host to achieve protective BCL1 immunity.","['Ciavarra, R P', 'Vitetta, E S', 'Forman, J']","['Ciavarra RP', 'Vitetta ES', 'Forman J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (anti-IgM)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1986/08/15 00:00,1986/08/15 00:01,['1986/08/15 00:00'],"['1986/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Aug 15;137(4):1371-5.,,,,,,,,

Interferon was most effective when injected at the site of tumor inoculation rather than at a distant site. Two factors seemed of especial importance: the amount of interferon injected and the frequency of interferon administration. Thus, for daily administration of interferon, the antitumor effect was directly related to the amount of interferon injected. For a given total dose of interferon, repeated administration of small doses of interferon was more effective than administration of a larger dose at more widely spaced intervals. The anti-tumor efficacy of interferon was independent of the number of FLC inoculated when 10(2) to 10(5) FLC were injected, but interferon treatment was less effective when 10(6) or 10(7) FLC were injected.

When erythroblasts from first trimester fetuses were used the hybrids expressed a fetal program of human globin expression. While in continuous culture, these hybrids switched from predominantly fetal to almost exclusively adult globin expression, providing direct evidence that switching can occur within a single cell lineage. Sequential studies of globin expression at a single cell level and subcloning experiments suggested that the switch reflects a progressive increase in the generation of beta + cells from gamma + cells. Hybrids formed with erythroblasts of second trimester fetuses switched faster than those produced with cells of first trimester fetuses.

The drug was given as three 1-h infusions, separated by intervals of 7 h. Treatment was repeated every 3-6 weeks. Forty-six cycles of 5-aza-dCyd were administered at 7 dose levels ranging from 25 to 100 mg/m2 in three infusions. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, with a delayed white blood cell nadir, occurring at Day 22. Other toxicities included a mild, reversible elevation of serum creatinine in three patients, minimal nausea and vomiting in six patients, and transient fatigue in three patients. In this study one partial response in a patient with an undifferentiated carcinoma of the ethmoid sinus was observed. Plasma and urinary concentrations of 5-aza-dCyd were measured using a bioassay based on growth inhibition of L1210 leukemia cells in vitro. For 75 and 100 mg/m2 given as 1-h infusions, mean peak plasma concentrations of 0.93 and 2.01 microM, respectively, were attained. In seven of nine courses at doses of 25-60 mg/m2, plasma 5-aza-dCyd concentration was less than 0.01 microM. In one case at 30 mg/m2 and another at 60 mg/m2, peak plasma drug concentrations were determined to be 0.244 and 0.409 microM, respectively. Following cessation of the infusion rapid disappearance of drug from plasma was observed with a t1/2 alpha and t1/2 beta of 7 and 35 min, respectively. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of less than 1% of the administered dose suggest that 5-aza-dCyd is eliminated rapidly and largely by metabolic processes.

At each of the effector:target ratios studied, the K562-R demonstrated a decrease in their susceptibility to both unstimulated and interferon-activated NK cells, as compared to the K562-S line. This difference did not appear to be related to a variable expression of NK target structures, as the number of effector:target conjugates was similar, and both lines competed equally well in cold target inhibition experiments. The K562-R cells were not resistant to complement or monocyte-mediated killing, suggesting a relatively specific resistance to cell-mediated killing.

Differences were noted not only between the sensitive and artificially developed resistant variants of P388, but also between the naturally sensitive (P388) and naturally resistant (colon 38) tumors. The artificially developed resistant P388 cell lines showed an inhibited capacity to accumulate nucleotides derived from ara-AC and deoxycytidine, whereas the accumulation of cytidine nucleotides remained unchanged. Studies of the initial velocity of facilitated diffusion of ara-AC showed only minor differences between parental and resistant lines, while the nucleotide formation rates from both ara-AC and deoxycytidine were markedly depressed in the latter cells. It is concluded, therefore, that the failure of resistant P388 cells to accumulate these compounds results not from a transport deficit per se but rather from a failure to convert the nucleosides to nondiffusible (i.e., phosphorylated) species inside the cell. This failure was accompanied by a substantial reduction in the incorporation of a radiolabeled product derived from deoxycytidine into the nucleic acids of the resistant clones. The common factor responsible for the resistance of P388 variants toward ara-AC appears to be a markedly decreased level of deoxycytidine kinase activity. The naturally resistant colon 38 carcinoma, on the other hand, in addition to a decrease in the activity of its deoxycytidine kinase, showed a lower level of activity of all its purine and pyrimidine kinases, along with a notably elevated nucleoside triphosphatase activity (with ATP as substrate) when compared to P388. These differences were reflected in lower endogenous nucleoside triphosphate pool sizes in colon 38, and in a lower level of ara-AC-5'-triphosphate accumulation in colon 38 than in P388 after comparable drug exposure. In the six human tumor lines, a positive correlation was established between sensitivity to ara-AC (as determined by its median inhibitory concentration) and cellular content of deoxycytidine kinase. It is concluded that this latter enzyme is a generally important determinant of sensitivity to arabinosyl-5-azacytosine.","['Ahluwalia, G S', 'Cohen, M B', 'Kang, G J', 'Arnold, S T', 'McMahon, J B', 'Dalal, M', 'Wilson, Y A', 'Cooney, D A', 'Balzarini, J', 'Johns, D G']","['Ahluwalia GS', 'Cohen MB', 'Kang GJ', 'Arnold ST', 'McMahon JB', 'Dalal M', 'Wilson YA', 'Cooney DA', 'Balzarini J', 'Johns DG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '5V71D8JOKK (fazarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cytidine/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Sep;46(9):4479-85.,,,,,,,,

The anionic MMC-D was synthesized using 6-bromohexanoic acid as a spacer and dextran with a molecular weight of 70,000 [MMC(C6)Dan].

MMC(C6)Dcat was adsorbed more readily than MMC or MMC(C6)Dan on the tumor cell surface by an electrostatic force. The percentage of adsorption remained almost constant during the course of incubation and no significant difference was observed between the incubation at 4 degrees C and that at 37 degrees C. A corresponding increase in the amounts of MMC(C6)Dcat adsorbed on with higher molecular weights was noted, which conformed to Langmuir's adsorption isotherm. In vitro antitumor activity was evaluated using L1210 and EAC cell culture systems and human tumor colony forming assay.

Here we report that milk-transmitted MuMTV also delays the development of the acute erythroleukemia induced by Friend leukemia virus (FLV), and retards, or prevents in some cases, the development of long-term lymphomas caused by its helper component. This is confirmed by the observation that the average life span of MuMTV-carrying mice infected with FLV or its helper component is prolonged by over 30% as compared to that of MuMTV-free animals infected with the same agents and by the finding that the replication of Friend viruses is reduced in mice neonatally exposed to MuMTV. Since the antibody responses of mice to MuMTV and to FLV were not cross-reactive, we searched for antiviral activity in the tissues of mice exposed to MuMTV, FLV, or the helper component of FLV. Low levels of interferon-alpha/beta were consistently detected in spleen extracts from mice infected with all these agents but could not be demonstrated in the spleens of uninfected BALB/c mice; thus, the chronic production of endogenous interferon is likely to play a major role in the reciprocal interference in vivo between retroviruses belonging to different genera.","['Basolo, F', 'Toniolo, A', 'Bistocchi, M', 'Fontanini, G', 'Squartini, F']","['Basolo F', 'Toniolo A', 'Bistocchi M', 'Fontanini G', 'Squartini F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology/*physiology', 'Interferons/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', '*Viral Interference', 'Virus Replication']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Aug;46(8):4064-70.,,,,,,,,

Analysis of drug uptake patterns shows that the Molt-4 resistant cells are defective in the initial intracellular accumulation of drug. In contrast to Molt-4 the levels of drug which accumulate in the sensitive and resistant HL-60 cells during a 60-min incubation period are essentially the same. However, when incubations are continued there is a major reduction in intracellular drug levels in the resistant cell. Further studies show that resistant cells incubated in the presence of drug for extended time periods efflux drug at a rate considerably greater than that exhibited by the sensitive parent line. Similar efflux patterns are obtained with nuclei isolated from drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Additional studies using an in vitro phosphorylation system demonstrate distinct protein changes in membranes of Molt-4 and HL-60 resistant cells. Thus, we have found that a membrane fraction from the Molt-4 resistant line contains a Mr 170,000 protein which is not detected in a similar fraction from cells sensitive to drug.

Previous studies have demonstrated that this molecule can be oxidized, yielding a reactive electrophilic form, which is able to bind covalently to a nucleophilic biological molecule. In this work, we evidenced a covalent binding of this drug to nucleic acids of L1210 cells in culture. A high performance liquid chromatography technique allowed us to distinguish between reversible and nonreversible interaction and to determine the binding ratio (rb) of covalently bound elliptinium versus bases of nucleic acids extracted from cells. After an 8-h incubation of L1210 cells with 0.1 microM elliptinium (the dose corresponding to the 50% inhibitory dose), we obtained 2.4 X 10(-6) and 3.4 X 10(-6) as the rb for RNA and DNA, respectively. The kinetics of binding was also studied. The dose-response relationship obtained is linear in a concentration range of 0.025 to 0.5 microM 9-OH-NME. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the covalent binding of 9-OH-NME to DNA is not repaired during a period of 40 h (during this period, the cell population has undergone two doublings). The nonhydroxylated and non-antitumoral derivative of 9-OH-NME, N2-methylellipticinium, is 20 to 30 times less active in terms of covalent binding to nucleic acids, compared to the antitumor compound 9-OH-NME. The implication of the covalent binding of 9-OH-NME is discussed with respect to its mechanism of action.","['Dugue, B', 'Auclair, C', 'Meunier, B']","['Dugue B', 'Auclair C', 'Meunier B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '1F1959S062 (elliptinium)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '69467-91-0 (2-methylellipticinium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*metabolism', 'Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Ellipticines/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acids/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tritium']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Aug;46(8):3828-33.,,,,,,,,

The HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line has served as a useful model of human granulocyte and macrophage differentiation in studies from many laboratories. We have previously reported that phorbol diesters, which induce differentiation along the macrophage pathway, stimulate HL-60 cells to become strikingly cytotoxic to a variety of red cell targets. We now report that agents known to differentiate HL-60 along the granulocyte pathway (retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, 5-azacytidine) do not, in themselves, induce HL-60 to become cytotoxic. However, previous exposure (3-5 days) to these granulocyte pathway active agents markedly enhances phorbol diester-triggered killing. This enhancement is particularly striking at decreased effector:target ratios (as low as one effector per five targets) and is also demonstrated by a shift to lower concentrations of the phorbol diester dose-response curve. Retinoic acid is the most effective of the three agents tested, although priming (previous exposure) with dimethyl sulfoxide or 5-azacytidine also markedly enhances killing. These studies demonstrate that HL-60-mediated killing may be dissected pharmacologically into at least two distinct steps and further support the utility of this model system in studies of the development of macrophage-like cytotoxic cells. This system has also proven to be useful in the characterization of cytokines which mimic the differentiation effects of retinoic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide (J. A. Leftwich and R. E.

In 12 of the 14 discrepant specimens, the paired specimen whose results were not interpreted as positive was technically unsatisfactory (nine specimens) or had cells suspicious for blast cells rather than unequivocal blast cells (three specimens). Blast cells were identified in specimens with low nucleated cell counts (less than or equal to 5/mm3) by both methods and usually were immediately preceded or followed by CSF specimens showing florid disease.

They cause two diseases which involve disturbances of the growth of the T4-lymphocyte. This target cell type, which is central to the regulation of the immune system is induced by human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) to excessive proliferation (leukaemia) and by HTLV-III/LAV (lymphadenopathy associated virus) to premature death (acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]). Both also seem to be indirectly involved in several other disorders. The genetic structures of these retroviruses and the mechanisms by which they usurp host-cell functions are novel among retroviruses. The continuous increase in the number of AIDS cases for whom no effective therapy is currently possible mandates attempts at developing primary prevention by a vaccine. Based on past attempts at developing vaccines against retroviruses, the most feasible configuration will be the glycoprotein linked to its transmembrane protein. Any virus preparation containing nucleic acids could be considered less safe. Potential problems exist in that there is extensive heterogeneity among various HTLV-III isolates, particularly in the env-gene. This fact and the known relationship of HTLV-III to some Lentiviruses suggest that functional antigenic variation could be encountered. The methodology of developing a vaccine against the retroviruses causing AIDS should also be helpful in designing vaccine strategies against human leukaemia and lymphomas caused by other members of this virus family.","['Dorner, F', 'Barrett, P N', 'Schmidt, B L', 'Bodemer, W']","['Dorner F', 'Barrett PN', 'Schmidt BL', 'Bodemer W']",,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Wien Med Wochenschr,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),8708475,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*microbiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/immunology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Code', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",1986/04/30 00:00,1986/04/30 00:01,['1986/04/30 00:00'],"['1986/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Med Wochenschr. 1986 Apr 30;136(7-8):181-8.,,,,,Die Molekularbiologie menschlicher T-lymphotroper Retroviren (HTLV).,,,

Although gene technology has made available an unlimited supply of all different kinds and types of IFN, their basic modes of action have not been clarified up to now. The therapeutic effects proven differ gradually between the individual disease entities. They comprise prophylaxis, prevention of recurrences and direct therapeutic effect, either of reducing the actual disease symptoms, or of inducing a complete recovery. For the following viral diseases a positive therapeutic effect has been shown: infections by herpes-viruses (herpes simplex keratitis , herpes zoster, herpes simplex), cytomegalovirus infections, chronic-hepatitis B virus infection, acute respiratory virus infections by rhino-, corona- and influenza viruses. Especially for the group of virus-associated tumors and papillomas, IFN is considered to be therapeutically effective. IFN has been accepted to be the first line treatment for laryngeal papillomatosis. In condylomata acuminata too, IFN is a potent therapeutic agent. Moreover, IFN represents the most effective therapeutic modality for Kaposi's sarcoma in patient with AIDS. Hairy cell leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, melanoma and hypernephroma are the malignancies, for which a therapeutic effect of IFN could be proven. Furthermore, IFN is considered to be the therapy of first choice for hairy cell leukemias. Although there are some signs, that IFN could be a potent agent for adjuvant therapy, this question can not be answered - not even on principle - because of lacking sufficient data so far. Up to date, the therapeutic efficacy of IFN seems to be established only for hairy cell leukemia, laryngeal papillomatosis, Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with AIDS and partly for condylomata acuminata. For all other indications, first of all, sufficient phase-II-study data will have to be evaluated, before prospectively controlled studies, comparing the IFN treatment results with placebo and standard therapy results, can be initiated for the individual disease entities. Then, it will be possible to assess the therapeutic efficacy of IFN. Already now, IFN represent a valuable enrichment of the therapeutic modalities for malignancies and viral diseases.","['Dittrich, C']",['Dittrich C'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Wien Med Wochenschr,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),8708475,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Retroviridae Infections/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/therapy', 'Tumor Virus Infections/therapy', 'Virus Diseases/*therapy']",1986/04/30 00:00,1986/04/30 00:01,['1986/04/30 00:00'],"['1986/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Med Wochenschr. 1986 Apr 30;136(7-8):163-72.,,,,,Gegenwartiger Stand der Interferon-Therapie.,,,

Demonstration and significance of hybridoid leukocytes.,107-14,"Blood smears from 13 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were examined for bigranulated (basophil/eosinophil) cells. The cells were stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa, toluidine blue, Biebrich scarlet, Adams' reaction, and were reacted for KCN-resistant peroxidase in two cases. A sequential stain (toluidine blue/Biebrich scarlet/Adams' reaction) was applied to 50 cells in each case. Hybridoid cells occurred in all cases with varying frequency. Double granulation was not only found in immature, non-segmented cells but often in mature segmented cells. The chimeric cells were difficult to detect with May-Grunwald-Giemsa. Biebrich scarlet and Adams' reaction being superior in this respect to Biebrich scarlet. Some granules that were positive by Adams' reaction did not stain with Biebrich scarlet. This is in sharp contrast to the normal and is, therefore, interpreted as a granule atypicality. Since under normal circumstances, eosinophilic and basophilic granules can be viewed as mutually exclusive markers of the respective granulocytic lineages, the simultaneous occurrence in CML cells of both markers demonstrates lineage infidelity. Until now lineage infidelity has been reported only in immature cells. However, our results show that lineage infidelity also occurs in mature segmented cells. This indicates that the progenitors of these chimeric granulocytes follow false genetic programs producing cells with profound irreversible neoplastic aberrations.","['Mlynek, M L', 'Leder, L D']","['Mlynek ML', 'Leder LD']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

The induction of pp60c-src kinase activity becomes apparent approximately 14 hr after the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and increases 20-fold by 72 hr. The enhanced kinase activity can be accounted for by elevated levels of c-src protein in the differentiated cells. When nonleukemic bone marrow cells were examined, myeloid progenitor cells exhibited a low level of pp60c-src kinase activity. As these cells are allowed to differentiate in culture, the resulting adherent monocytes are as high in pp60c-src kinase activity as HL-60 cells induced to differentiate into monocytes. A strong correlation is found between the levels of pp60c-src kinase activity and the degree of monocytic differentiation of the cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

These antibodies were characterized by competitive antibody-binding assay and sequential immunoprecipitation assay with four known monoclonal antibodies to the human IL-2R molecule. The twelve new monoclonal antibodies were divided among the four known antibody types, the HIEI-, H-A26-, H-31-, and anti-Tac-type, and an additional new type, the H-48-type. The H-48 antibody did not compete with any other antibodies in the competitive binding assay. The binding of 125I-IL-2 to MT-2 cells and the IL-2-dependent growth of normal activated T-cells were both strongly inhibited by all the H-31- and anti-Tac-type antibodies, and partially or slightly inhibited by HIEI- and H-A26-type antibodies, but were not inhibited by the H-48 antibody. Thus, the same type of monoclonal antibodies had a similar effect on the function of IL-2R. These results suggest that epitopes for the same type of antibodies could be single identical epitopes or epitopes closely associated with each other. On the other hand, these antibodies also reacted variously with a panel of various human and simian lymphoid cell lines immortalized with human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I): the H-45 antibody reacted only with the human cell lines, the H-C1 and H-44 and H-47 antibodies reacted with human and ape cell lines, and the other antibodies reacted with cell lines of humans, apes and Old and New World monkeys. These differences in the reactivity of the antibodies with the primate cell lines suggest that the antigenic structure of the IL-2R molecule changed during evolutionary divergence of the primates.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Inoi, T', 'Tozawa, H', 'Sugamura, K', 'Hinuma, Y']","['Tanaka Y', 'Inoi T', 'Tozawa H', 'Sugamura K', 'Hinuma Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Primates', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Species Specificity', 'Trypsin']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1986.tb00954.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1986;30(4):373-88. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1986.tb00954.x.,,,,,,,,

All three monoclonal antibodies reacted with previously undescribed antigenic determinants on the PMC42 cell line. Antibody CIBr18 reacted only with the immunizing cell line PMC42, whereas antibodies CIBr2 and CIBr7 showed minimal reactivity toward a panel of 34 human leukemia- and solid tumor-derived cell lines. The antigenic determinants detected by the three antibodies were distinct, and each showed variable expression in PMC42 monolayer and organoid cultures. The heterogeneity of staining seen on PMC42 cultures may reflect the fact that this cell line contains up to eight morphologically distinct cell types. Antigen expression correlated with cell type in some instances, whereas in other instances phenotypic subdivision within a cell type was apparent. Antigens recognized by antibodies CIBr7 and CIBr18 were characterized biochemically. In Western blotting, antibody CIBr7 identified a single band of an apparent molecular weight of 38,000 within PMC42 cell lysates. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of polypeptides immunoprecipitated by antibody CIBr18 from [35S]methionine-labeled PMC42 cell lysates identified two glycoproteins of apparent molecular weights of 115,000 and 120,000, respectively. No biochemical data for the CIBr2 antigen are yet available. All three antigens were detected in human mammary epithelium and some non-breast tissues.

K562 cells were terminally differentiated with PMA to nitroblue tetrazolium-(NBT) positive macrophages. Expression of 3-fucosyl-N-acetyl lactosamine, previously thought to be myeloid specific but found on all early hematopoietic progenitors, was modulated during differentiation to nonmyeloid lineages. Lineage infidelity was noted during functional differentiation along all hematopoietic lineages. The presence of multiple lineage surface markers and cytoplasmic characteristics in leukemic cells is not indicative of lack of potential to differentiate.

The pI value of IL-2 prepared from ISO-treated PBMC shifted to 8.2 after treatment with neuraminidase, demonstrating that the IL-2 molecules isolated from ISO-treated PBMC possessed sialic acid. The pI values of the IL-2 isolated from ISO-treated and untreated HUT-78 culture supernatants were identical (pI = 7.8) and were not modified by neuraminidase treatment. These results suggest that the increase in IL-2 production following treatment of PBMC with ISO may be mediated through the activation of a distinct subset of IL-2 producing cells. Furthermore, the sialylation of IL-2 may be of physiologic and immunopharmacologic importance.","['Tsang, K Y', 'Boutin, B', 'Pathak, S K', 'Donnelly, R', 'Koopmann, W R Jr', 'Fleck, R', 'Miribel, L', 'Arnaud, P']","['Tsang KY', 'Boutin B', 'Pathak SK', 'Donnelly R', 'Koopmann WR Jr', 'Fleck R', 'Miribel L', 'Arnaud P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'W1SO0V223F (Inosine Pranobex)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Culture Media/analysis', 'Humans', 'Inosine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Inosine Pranobex/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Lymphocytes/classification/metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Sialic Acids/*metabolism']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(86)90004-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(86)90004-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1986 Apr;12(4):195-200. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(86)90004-0.,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) induced in AKR mice by syngeneic leukemia 369 which expressed high amounts of H-2 antigens recognized viral gag polyproteins in association with H-2K antigens as target antigens. H-2K-negative leukemias were resistant to lysis by AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL and did not induce a cellular immune response. However, they became susceptible after stimulation with interferon. H-2K-positive leukemias induced CTL which were cytotoxic for 369 cells. However, the majority of H-2K-positive leukemias was not lysed by CTL induced by autologous immunization. These leukemias were also resistant to lysis by anti-369 CTL, but could restimulate AKR/Gross-specific CTL in vitro, and were susceptible to lysis by H-2Kk-restricted CTL against AKR minor histocompatibility antigens. Thus, there could be specific defects of the H-2Kk antigens of these tumors. However, there were also qualitative and quantitative differences in antigenic determinants of the gag target antigens in these leukemias. Therefore, in addition to quantitative reduction of the H-2K restriction elements, qualitative alterations of H-2 antigens or of the viral target antigens may impair T cell cytotoxicity and thus influence leukemogenesis of AKR spontaneous leukemia.","['Schafer, A', 'Schmidt, W']","['Schafer A', 'Schmidt W']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, gag', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization', '*Immunologic Surveillance', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830160707 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1986 Jul;16(7):753-9. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830160707.,,,,,,,,

The results show that the two proteins are necessary and sufficient for the opening of cation channels. Both aggregation of Fc epsilon receptor via IgE with a specific antigen and of CBP by anti-CBP induce channels with similar conductances and open-time distributions. In the presence of 1.8 mM calcium, the most frequently observed channels have a conductance of 1-2 pS. At 100 mM calcium conductance increased to 4-5 pS.

Injection of such pressure-treated and irradiated EL-4 cells into syngeneic naive C57Bl/6 mice significantly delayed tumor development and increased survival after subsequent challenge with untreated EL-4 cells. Application of pressure of 1500 atm for a longer period of time (e.g., 120 min) resulted in cell death and a smaller increase in tumor immunogenicity which could be partially accounted for by passive shedding of membrane material. Unlike previously studied tumor cells, incorporation of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) into the plasma membrane of EL-4 cells increased their apparent tumor immunogenicity only slightly. In addition, isolated EL-4 plasma membranes, untreated, CHS-treated or pressure-treated, as well as the material shed thereof by hydrostatic pressure, were all of weak immunogenicity. Modulation in the projection of surface antigens upon pressure treatment could account for the observed increase in tumor immunogenicity and was monitored via the Thy 1.2 antigen. Fluorescence cell sorting analysis indicated that upon application of 1500 atm for different periods of time the projection of Thy 1.2 progressively and irreversibly increased to a maximal level of about 140% at 15 min. At longer pressurization the availability of Thy 1.2 to antibody binding decreased sharply to levels below that of the untreated cells.

The expression of cellular oncogenes (c-Ha-ras and c-myc) in tumor-originated cells was also suppressed by IFN-beta. These results suggest that such suppression is one possible mechanism of the direct anticellular effect induced by IFN-beta. IFN-beta augmented NK cell activity and the ADCC activity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is also suggested that these are two of the immune system-mediated mechanisms responsible for the indirect antitumor effect of IFN-beta in vivo.","['Kanamori, T', 'Nakamura, N', 'Tobita, M', 'Horisawa, Y', 'Suzuki, M', 'Asami, T', 'Yajima, T', 'Nobuhara, M']","['Kanamori T', 'Nakamura N', 'Tobita M', 'Horisawa Y', 'Suzuki M', 'Asami T', 'Yajima T', 'Nobuhara M']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

A 5-h continuous exposure to the drug at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 micrograms/ml caused an accumulation of cells in the S portion of the DNA histograms indicating a slowing of the progression of cells in the S phase. A longer exposure time (10 h) at the same concentrations led to a bimodal DNA distribution (peaks at G1 and G2-M) and a depletion of the S phase. When the exposure time to 5-aza-dCyd (0.1 microgram/ml) was extended to 15 and 20 h, there was a decrease in the G2-M peak and an augmentation of the G1 peak. To determine if 5-aza-dCyd produced a block in cell cycle progression, L1210 cells were treated for 10 h with colcemid and 5-aza-dCyd simultaneously for 10 h. Colcemid alone, or colcemid in combination with 5-aza-dCyd produced an accumulation of cells under a single G2-M peak. This indicates that 5-aza-dCyd did not block the progression of L1210 cells through S phase, but only produced a slowing down of this event. These results, indicating that 5-aza-dCyd does not block cell cycle progression and that its cytotoxic action is not self-limiting, are of importance for designing future clinical trials.","['Chabot, G G', 'Momparler, R L']","['Chabot GG', 'Momparler RL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Decitabine', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90088-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(5):533-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90088-3.,,,,,,,,

Treatment of 12 with formaldehyde and Na(CN)BH3 afforded 5-methyl-5-deazamethotrexate, which was also prepared from 15 and dimethyl N-[(4-methylamino)benzoyl]-L-glutamate followed by ester hydrolysis. 5-Methyl-10-ethyl-5-deazaaminopterin was similarly prepared from 15. Biological evaluation of the 5-methyl-5-deaza analogues together with previously reported 5-deazaaminopterin and 5-deazamethotrexate for inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) isolated from L1210 cells and for their effect on cell growth inhibition, transport characteristics, and net accumulation of polyglutamate forms in L1210 cells revealed the analogues to have essentially the same properties as the appropriate parent compound, aminopterin or methotrexate (MTX), except that 20 and 21 were approximately 10 times more growth inhibitory than MTX. In in vivo tests against P388/0 and P388/MTX leukemia in mice, the analogues showed activity comparable to that of MTX, with the more potent 20 producing the same response in the P388/0 test as MTX but at one-fourth the dose; none showed activity against P388/MTX. Hydrolytic deamination of 12 and 20 produced 5-methyl-5-deazafolic acid and 5,10-dimethyl-5-deazafolic acid, respectively. In bacterial studies on the 2-amino-4-oxo analogues, 5-deazafolic acid proved to be a potent inhibitor of Lactobacillus casei DHFR and also the growth of both L. casei ATCC 7469 and Streptococcus faecium ATCC 8043. Its 5-methyl congener 22 is also inhibitory toward L. casei, but its IC50 for growth inhibition is much lower than its IC50 values for inhibition of DHFR or thymidylate synthase from L. casei, suggesting an alternate site of action.","['Piper, J R', 'McCaleb, G S', 'Montgomery, J A', 'Kisliuk, R L', 'Gaumont, Y', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Piper JR', 'McCaleb GS', 'Montgomery JA', 'Kisliuk RL', 'Gaumont Y', 'Sirotnak FM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '2410-93-7 (N(10)-methylfolate)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Bacteria/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00156a029 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1986 Jun;29(6):1080-7. doi: 10.1021/jm00156a029.,"['CA18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

A prospectively randomized study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,838-46,"A randomized clinical trial of combination chemotherapy for patients who relapsed following primary radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease was conducted from 1975 to 1981 by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). One hundred thirteen patients were prospectively randomized to receive 12 cycles of either CVPP (CCNU, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone), ABOS (bleomycin, vincristine [Oncovin; Lilly, Indianapolis], doxorubicin [Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio], and streptozotocin), or alternating cycles of CVPP and ABOS. The median length of observation for patients in this report is 4 years. Toxicities of the three treatment programs were primarily hematologic. Frequencies of complete response were 72% for CVPP, 70% for ABOS, and 82% for CVPP/ABOS (P = .37). Females and patients who had nodular sclerosing disease at initial diagnosis had significantly higher complete response rates. The 5-year disease-free survival for the complete responders was 55%; the 5-year overall survival was 60%. There were no significant differences among the treatments on disease-free survival (P = .78) or overall survival (P = .18). Age under 40 years was the only significant positive prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P = .095) and overall survival (P = .003). This study demonstrates no statistically significant advantage for alternating cycles of combination chemotherapy in affecting complete response frequency, disease-free survival, or overall survival as compared with therapy with CVPP or ABOS alone.

Human B lymphocytes were obtained from peripheral blood of normal donors and cultured in the presence of anti-IgM (mu chain specific) and BCGF. Frequent refeedings with fresh medium containing BCGF and anti-IgM led to the establishment of a long term cultured human B cell line, HAB-40. Phenotyping of HAB-40 revealed that the cell population consisted predominantly of IgM-bearing (72%) and B1 (100%) positive cells. This B cell line consistently secreted IgM and IgG when co-cultured in the presence of PMA, anti-IgM and beta or gamma interferon (IFN). Also, it was Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) positive (100%). HAB-40 cells have been successfully maintained in the presence of BCGF without anti-IgM for over a year. Removal of BCGF led to the rapid loss of viable cells in cultures containing less than 2% serum. HAB-40 cells in microassays exhibited a marked dose-dependent incorporation of [3H]thymidine in response to BCGF in the absence of any exogenous stimulants such as anti-IgM or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC). Recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2) failed to augment the [3H]thymidine uptake by these B cells despite the low density expression of Tac antigen (IL-2 receptor) on their cell surface, or even when the cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to express higher density of Tac antigen (48%). HAB-40 cells could be maintained in BCGF which was partially purified to deplete it of other contaminating proteins. None of the seven well established EBNA-positive human B cell lines nor two chronic B lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cell lines that were tested showed BCGF dependence. The same BCGF-active chromatographic fractions that were active on HAB-40 cells also stimulated BCL1 and normal human B cells stimulated with anti-IgM.

No correlation was observed between the susceptibility of the target cell lines to growth inhibition and to lysis by NK cells. Rather, the spectrum of cytostatic activity and the characteristics of the soluble factor were similar to those of leukoregulin, a recently described lymphokine. The supernatants of tumor-lymphocyte cultures contained only low levels of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, and antibodies to interferons did not affect the observed growth inhibition. The pattern of target cell susceptibility to growth inhibition by this factor was also quite distinct from that seen with purified recombinant LT or TNF. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies to these cytokines also had no effect on the cytostasis, arguing against a requirement for, or synergistic interaction with, low levels of these cytokines. Some of the targets susceptible to the factor were only growth inhibited but not lysed, thereby distinguishing it from NKCF. Furthermore, the cytostasis was not inhibited by mannose-6-PO4 or rabbit antibodies to granule cytolysin, both of which have been reported to block NKCF.

The DNA from the HOON cell lines has been co-transfected with the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene into mouse L cells. By using a flow cytometer, a stable thymidine kinase-positive cell population expressing both 44H7 and 44D7 antigens of the human leukemic cells has been generated by repeated sorting of cells reactive with monoclonal antibody 44H7. After three sequential sorting experiments, cloned cell lines were established, and a subclone designated 3D5 has been additionally characterized. Greater than 90% of the 3D5 cells stained positively with monoclonal antibodies 44H7 and 44D7 and with 4F2, which reacts with an epitope identical or spatially related to that seen by 44D7. The ratio of antigenic density 4F2:44D7 calculated from the relative fluorescence indices was similar on the HOON leukemic cells and on the 3D5 transfectant cells. However, 3D5, which was selected with antibody 44H7, expressed a higher ratio of 44H7:44D7 than did the HOON cells. The molecular complex carrying these epitopes was isolated from a 3D5 cell extract on a column of 44D7-IgG-Sepharose and was additionally purified by immunoprecipitation. Although several polypeptide chains were present in the immunoprecipitates, the major polypeptide band had an apparent m.w. of 127,000 under nonreducing conditions. After reduction, three bands of apparent m.w. 91,000, 38,000, and 33,000 appeared. The presence of the 91,000 and 38,000 subunits linked by disulfide bonds was also observed for the 44D7 antigen isolated from HOON cells, whereas the polypeptide of apparent m.w. 33,000 was only seen in immunoprecipitates of the transfectant cell extracts. Because the antigen expressed in the transfectants is associated with a multimeric complex containing disulfide-linked subunits, it is possible that only the gene encoding one of the polypeptide chains, namely that carrying the epitopes, was in fact transfected. This HOON gene product could be one subunit associating with murine subunits encoded by genes of the L cell. Alternatively, the antigenic complex may be the product of closely linked genes transfected together, or of a single human gene that is modified post-translationally to create a disulfide-linked complex.","['Quackenbush, E J', 'Linsley, P', 'Letarte, M']","['Quackenbush EJ', 'Linsley P', 'Letarte M']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Epitopes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Cell Extracts/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Epitopes/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'L Cells/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Transfection']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jul 1;137(1):234-9.,,,,,,,,

In dose-response curves the extent of the cytoskeletal association appears to follow the extent of bridging, continuing to increase beyond where stimulated degranulation is maximal. This stable association is maintained after the aggregated IgE-receptor complexes have been internalized by the cell. Multivalent antigen and trimeric IgE cause less extensive receptor cross-linking than anti-IgE and stimulate degranulation; they also induce receptor association with the cytoskeleton that is revealed only after stabilization by addition of a chemical cross-linking reagent. The ability of a membrane impermeant chemical cross-linker to stabilize this association suggests that the receptor-cytoskeletal interaction may be mediated by a transmembrane protein that is exposed at the cell surface. Monomeric and dimeric IgE bound to receptors fail to induce a stable interaction with the cytoskeleton even in the presence of chemical cross-linkers and are poor (dimers) or insignificant (monomers) stimulators of cellular degranulation. These findings are consistent with a possible relationship between receptor attachment to the cytoskeleton, receptor immobilization as measured by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, and the triggering of cellular degranulation.","['Robertson, D', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B']","['Robertson D', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Succinimides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)', 'E647932J7Z (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate)', 'EVY5D0U6SH (dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate))', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', 'Basophils/immunology/*metabolism', '*Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cytoskeleton/immunology/*metabolism', 'Dinitrobenzenes/immunology', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluoresceins', 'Histamine Release', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*metabolism', 'Octoxynol', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Succinimides', 'Thiocyanates']",1986/06/15 00:00,1986/06/15 00:01,['1986/06/15 00:00'],"['1986/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jun 15;136(12):4565-72.,"['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07273/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

The current study employs an in vitro indirect rosette assay to demonstrate that PCLF can interact with the mast cell surface. Sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were hapten conjugated with trinitrophenyl (TNP), dinitrophenyl (DNP), or oxazolone (OX). When TNP-conjugated SRBC were coated with PCLF, monoclonal anti-DNP IgE, or anti-DNP IgG1, they produced 40 to 50% rosettes with purified normal mouse peritoneal mast cells. Analogous antigen-binding factors, from lymphoid cells of OX and dinitrofluorobenzene contact-sensitized mice, gave similar mast cell rosetting levels with OX-SRBC and DNP-SRBC, respectively. PCLF demonstrated a high degree of hapten specificity in that it formed rosettes with TNP-SRBC but not with DNP-SRBC, unlike IgE and IgG1, or DNPF, which formed rosettes with either SRBC type. Similarly, soluble TNP-BSA could inhibit PCLF rosette-forming capacity, but soluble DNP-BSA could not. In addition to mouse mast cells, PCLF formed rosettes with rat basophil leukemia cells, mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages, mouse alveolar macrophages, and J 774 cultured mouse macrophages; it did not form rosettes with rat mast cells, rat alveolar macrophages, or mouse spleen cells. Thus, PCLF-formed rosettes were antigen specific, relatively species specific, and mast cell/macrophage specific. PCLF-mediated rosette-forming activity could be detected in the presence of nanogram quantities of PCLF. More than 10 times greater IgE was needed to produce IgE-mediated rosettes. Reduction and alkylation eliminated the rosetting activity of IgE, but the rosetting activity of PCLF was not affected. PCLF, but not IgE rosette-forming activity, could be removed by and eluted from affinity columns linked with a monoclonal antibody specific for T cell-derived antigen-binding factors, whereas PCLF rosetting activity was not retained by an anti-immunoglobulin affinity column. Preincubation of mast cells with rat myeloma IgE or mouse monoclonal IgE of various specificities blocked IgE rosettes but not PCLF-induced rosettes. Other immunoglobulin isotypes likewise did not block PCLF rosettes. However, PCLF rosettes could be blocked by preincubation of mast cells with OX factor (OXF),and OXF-mediated rosettes could be blocked similarly by PCLF. These results suggest that the antigen-binding T cell factor PCLF interacts with a unique receptor on the surface of mouse mast cells.","['Kops, S K', 'Ratzlaff, R E', 'Meade, R', 'Iverson, G M', 'Askenase, P W']","['Kops SK', 'Ratzlaff RE', 'Meade R', 'Iverson GM', 'Askenase PW']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Prostatic Secretory Proteins)', '0 (beta-microseminoprotein)', '0 (immunoglobulin-binding factors)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'Z4ZG7O5SZ9 (Picryl Chloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Picryl Chloride/pharmacology', '*Prostatic Secretory Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rosette Formation/*methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism']",1986/06/15 00:00,1986/06/15 00:01,['1986/06/15 00:00'],"['1986/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jun 15;136(12):4515-24.,"['AI-11077/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-12211/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Single, cell-size phospholipid vesicles containing a dinitrophenyl (DNP)-lipid hapten were maneuvered into contact with rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells carrying fluorescent anti-DNP IgE in their cell-surface Fc epsilon receptors. Upon cell-vesicle contact the antibody molecules underwent a marked lateral redistribution, accumulating at the site of contact and becoming significantly depleted from noncontacting membrane. As assayed with a micropipette suction method, there was a time-dependent increase in the strength of cell-vesicle adhesion. This development of adhesion paralleled the kinetics of accumulation of the adhesion-mediating antibody molecules at the zone of membrane-membrane contact. Both adhesion and redistribution were absolutely dependent upon a specific interaction of the IgE with the hapten: No redistribution occurred when vesicles lacking the DNP hapten were pushed against IgE-armed RBL cells, and on cells bearing a 1:1 mixture of nonimmune rat IgE and anti-DNP mouse IgE, only the latter underwent redistribution. Vesicles containing DNP-lipids bound to RBL cells carrying anti-DNP IgE but not to cells carrying nonimmune rat IgE. Measurable nonspecific binding did not develop even after 15 min of pushing DNP-bearing vesicles against RBL cells sensitized with nonimmune IgE. Neither redistribution nor adhesion was blocked by metabolic poisons such as NaN3 and NaF. Both redistribution and adhesion occurred in plasma membrane blebs previously shown to lack cytoskeletal filaments. The above observations are consistent with contact-induced redistribution of the IgE being a result of passive diffusion-mediated trapping rather than active cellular responses. Thus, long-range diffusion of specific proteins can in some cases contribute to the formation of stable adhesion between membranes.","['McCloskey, M A', 'Poo, M M']","['McCloskey MA', 'Poo MM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism/physiology/ultrastructure', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism/physiology', 'Dinitrophenols/metabolism', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Epitopes', 'Haptens', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism/physiology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.102.6.2185 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1986 Jun;102(6):2185-96. doi: 10.1083/jcb.102.6.2185.,"['GM 30666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 35901/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2114238,,,,,,

There was minimal to no effect of 100 microM FUra on total cytoplasmic DHFR-mRNA levels by 6 and 12 h and only a 25% reduction by 24 h. These results contrasted with the nuclear DHFR-mRNA levels which by 6 h following exposure to FUra increased by 80% in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, some of the increased nuclear DHFR-mRNA was found to be in a non-polyadenylated form. Under conditions to examine only RNA synthesized during the drug exposure, FUra was found to markedly enhance the level of newly synthesized nuclear DHFR-mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, while also producing an apparent dose-dependent reduction in the cytoplasmic DHFR-mRNA. RNA fractionated by 1.5% agarose-urea gel electrophoresis revealed two major cytoplasmic DHFR-mRNA species approximately 1.8 and 0.8 kilobases in size. Following a 24-h FUra exposure, a dose-dependent loss of the 0.8-kilobase DHFR-mRNA was observed. The combined results of these experiments indicate that FUra treatment reduces the ability of nascent DHFR-mRNA to relocate to the cytoplasm, suggesting either an inhibition of mRNA processing or nuclear-cytoplasmic transport.","['Armstrong, R D', 'Lewis, M', 'Stern, S G', 'Cadman, E C']","['Armstrong RD', 'Lewis M', 'Stern SG', 'Cadman EC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytidine/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Tritium']",1986/06/05 00:00,1986/06/05 00:01,['1986/06/05 00:00'],"['1986/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)38400-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Jun 5;261(16):7366-71.,"['CA 07162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Abrogation of cytolytic activity by SP was not the result of direct lymphotoxicity, although a reduction of approximately 50% in the number of target binding cells was observed. In addition, the cytotoxicity of interferon (alpha-IFN, beta-IFN, gamma-IFN) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) activated human PBMNC was suppressed by components present in human SP, although IL-2 activated human PBMC were relatively resistant to suppression compared with other effector (spontaneous or activated) populations. Following 1 h exposure to SP, PBMNC failed to recover more than 25% of their initial cytotoxic potential upon further in vitro incubation (18 h) in the absence of SP. However, both interferon and IL-2 caused an increase in the cytotoxicity of these populations, in some instances to the level obtained with control, IFN or IL-2 activated PBMNC.

The method is based on the particular properties of a hydrophobic fluorescent probe, 1-[4-(trimethylammonio)phenyl]-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene (TMA-DPH) [Prendergast, F.G., Haugland, R.P., & Callahan, P.J.

(1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 845, 60-67]. When this probe is interacted with intact resting cells in aqueous suspensions, it labels solely the membranes that are in contact with the external medium and is incorporated into them according to a partition equilibrium; i.e., the amount of the probe incorporated is proportional to the available membrane surface. TMA-DPH is highly fluorescent in membranes and not at all in water. Thus, a measurement of the TMA-DPH fluorescence intensity provides a signal proportional to the membrane surface. In secretory cells, the membrane surface available for the probe is increased upon fusion of the membrane of the secretory granules with the cell plasma membranes, directly or via intergranule fusion. Thus, when these cells are stimulated, more TMA-DPH is incorporated than in resting cells since the probe is allowed to also interact with the granule membranes now connected with the external medium by pores. This process results in a proportional increase in the TMA-DPH fluorescence intensity. The response was found to be very rapid and able to follow accurately the exocytosis kinetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bronner, C', 'Landry, Y', 'Fonteneau, P', 'Kuhry, J G']","['Bronner C', 'Landry Y', 'Fonteneau P', 'Kuhry JG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '1720-32-7 (Diphenylhexatriene)', '71316-28-4 (1-(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/physiology', 'Diphenylhexatriene/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Exocytosis', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Histamine Release', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1986/04/22 00:00,1986/04/22 00:01,['1986/04/22 00:00'],"['1986/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00356a045 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1986 Apr 22;25(8):2149-54. doi: 10.1021/bi00356a045.,,,,,,,,

However, K562 cells expressed globoside when induced to mature into erythroblasts by sodium butyrate. Cells of patients with various leukaemias were also tested. A significant number of positively reacting cells was frequently (six out of 18) seen in cases with a CML blast crisis (CML-BC) and rarely in AML (four out of 37 cases).

Calcium slow-channel blockers, e.g. nifedipine and verapamil, have been shown to inhibit the synthesis of SRS (SRS-A, leukotrienes) in human and guinea pig lung tissue, thromboxane A2 formation in rat lung and platelet activating factor in human neutrophils. Verapamil and nifedipine also prevent the release of lysosomal enzymes from rabbit and human polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Calcium-channel blockers produce variable inhibitory effects on allergic and nonallergic histamine secretion. Ca++-entry blockers also inhibit the Ca++ uptake (influx) into mast cells. Many of these inhibitory effects of Ca++ antagonists are antagonized by an increased extracellular Ca++ ion concentration. The magnitude of the inhibitory influences of Ca++-channel blockers on allergic and nonallergic release of chemical mediators appears to depend on the cell source, species, nature and the concentration of the secretory stimuli as well as on the composition and pH of buffers and the concentration of Ca++-entry blockers used. The data summarized in this review suggest the existence of a functional heterogeneity of Ca++ channels in leukocytes, mast cells and basophils. Interference with the Ca++-dependent steps involved in the formation and/or release of chemical mediators appears to be the primary mode of action for Ca++-channel blockers in these cells. The differential effects of Ca++ antagonists on Ca++-dependent activation of phospholipase A2,5-lipoxygenase, and calmodulin (or other intracellular Ca++-binding proteins) in different cell types (mast cells, basophils, leukocytes, lung tissue, etc.) may explain the variation of their effectiveness in inhibiting the synthesis/release of chemical mediators and antagonizing bronchoconstriction in response to diverse stimuli. During the process of hypersensitization and in immediate hypersensitivity diseases, Ca++ homeostasis (uptake, mobilization, distribution, relocation, etc.) may be altered in leukocytes (mast cells, basophils) and lung tissues. The altered Ca++ homeostasis could be responsible for the induction of airway hyperreactivity in asthmatics and for hyperreleasability of chemical mediators from leukocytes, mast cells and other cell types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Chand, N', 'Perhach, J L Jr', 'Diamantis, W', 'Sofia, R D']","['Chand N', 'Perhach JL Jr', 'Diamantis W', 'Sofia RD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Agents Actions,Agents and actions,0213341,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Ion Channels)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Lung/physiology', 'Lung Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats']",1986/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01965507 [doi]'],ppublish,Agents Actions. 1986 Mar;17(5-6):407-17. doi: 10.1007/BF01965507.,,,,,,90,,

We exposed lymph-node cells derived from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia to the Epstein-Barr virus in vitro and obtained a B-cell clone (designated 0.5 alpha) by a limiting dilution technique. The secreted product of 0.5 alpha is a monoclonal antibody (also designated 0.5 alpha; that is IgG1 and has kappa light chains) that binds to the cell membrane of T-cells infected with HTLV-I and lyses them in the presence of complement. The antibody does not react with HTLV-I-negative T cells. In electroblot assays, the monoclonal antibody detects a 46-kDa glycoprotein in disrupted HTLV-I virions and a 34-kDa product following digestion of the viral protein with endoglycosidase F. These molecules have been reported to represent the HTLV-I env gene products. The antibody does not react with HTLV-II and HTLV-III virions. Glycoproteins of 61 and 68 kDa, which are known to be encoded at least in part by the env gene of HTLV-I, are precipitated by the antibody from endogenously radiolabeled HTLV-I-infected HUT 102-B2 and MT-2 cells, respectively. These results suggest that this human monoclonal antibody reacts with an env-encoded glycoprotein of HTLV-I. By using a competition assay with a biotin-labeled 0.5 alpha antibody, we observed that 15 out of 15 patients with adult T-cell leukemia had antibodies that block binding of the 0.5 alpha antibody to HTLV-I virions. This suggests that the antigen detected by 0.5 alpha antibody is a common epitope recognized in HTLV-I-infected individuals in vivo. This antibody, as well as the general strategy for making human monoclonal antibodies reactive against pathogenic retroviruses, may have diagnostic or therapeutic application.","['Matsushita, S', 'Robert-Guroff, M', 'Trepel, J', 'Cossman, J', 'Mitsuya, H', 'Broder, S']","['Matsushita S', 'Robert-Guroff M', 'Trepel J', 'Cossman J', 'Mitsuya H', 'Broder S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.8.2672 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Apr;83(8):2672-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.8.2672.,,PMC323361,,,,,,

Treatment of responder FBL-immune spleen cells with alpha L3T4 plus complement before culture, as well as the direct addition of alpha L3T4 to cultures, diminished the generation of FBL-specific CTL. The contribution of L3T4+ cells could be completely replaced by the addition of exogenous cytokines. The data demonstrate that the optimal generation of FBL-specific Lyt-2+ CTL requires the presence of L3T4+ cells, presumably to provide necessary lymphokines. FBL-specific CTL could not be generated from purified FBL-immune T cells in the absence of AC. Syngeneic Ia+ macrophages (M phi), added at the initiation of culture, restored the response of purified T cells. Pretreatment of M phi with ammonium chloride or chloroquine, or the addition of monoclonal alpha I-Ab antibody at the initiation of culture, inhibited the ability of M phi to reconstitute the CTL response. Finally, the addition of exogenous helper factors could replace M phi and reconstitute the FBL-specific response of AC-depleted immune T cells. These results suggest that during the generation of Lyt-2+ CTL to a syngeneic tumor expressing only Class I MHC antigens, Ia+ AC are required to biochemically process antigen released from the tumor cells and present this modified antigen to Class II-restricted T helper cells.","['Kern, D E', 'Klarnet, J P', 'Jensen, M C', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Kern DE', 'Klarnet JP', 'Jensen MC', 'Greenberg PD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Communication', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Monokines', 'Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jun 1;136(11):4303-10.,"['CA 30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 07266/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

We studied the source of this arachidonic acid released after IgE or calcium ionophore A23187 stimulation. The 48-hr culture of the cells with [14C]arachidonic acid resulted in labeling of the phospholipids to constant specific activity. After IgE stimulation, 8.8% of the cellular [14C]arachidonate was released; this was predominantly from phosphatidylinositol (PI)/phosphatidylserine (PS) (66.3%), less from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (25.9%), and minimally from phosphatidylcholine (PC). In contrast, after ionophore stimulation the cells released 16.4% of cellular [14C]arachidonate, most of this was from PE (55.4%) followed by about equal amounts from PS/PI and PC (24% and 20%, respectively). Therefore, the source of the released arachidonic acid depends on the stimulus. In contrast, the results are different when the cells are cultured for only 2 hr with [14C]arachidonic acid.

Both IL 2-activated T cells and NK cells were cytolytic for HTLV-I-infected targets. However, only LGL demonstrated significant spontaneous activity against HTLV-I-infected targets. Similarly, LGL showed spontaneous cytolytic activity against HTLV-III/LAV-infected targets, and this cytotoxicity was considerably augmented by IL 2. In contrast, T cells and monocytes were unable to lyse HTLV-III/LAV targets, and only minimal activity was induced by activation. LGL cells, B cells, and monocytes were infectible in vitro by high titers of HTLV-III/LAV. However, levels of reverse transcriptase found in these cultures were significantly lower than the levels in T cell cultures. In contrast, only T cells were susceptible to infection by HTLV-I. Experiments with the use of cell cocultures showed that LGL afforded T cells protection from infection by HTLV-I (as indicated by lack of transformation and viral protein expression) but not from infection by HTLV-III/LAV.

A major advantage of the method is that it allows a large number of samples to be screened in a comparatively short time. Unlike other semi-automated colorimetric assays, such as ELISA, the procedure does not require cell fixation, which can destroy some antigenic determinants. The original assay of O'Neill and Parish (1) has been modified to give increased sensitivity and also to enable the detection of erythrocyte specific antibodies by elimination of the dye staining step and direct measurement of haemoglobin by spectrophotometry.

The structural basis for the cross-reactivity of the RA synovial membrane 62,000-mol-wt protein and the EBNA-1 antigen appears to reside in the glycine-alanine rich region of these molecules.

Since strong antibody responses to EBNA-1 are known to exist in RA patients, these results suggest that immune responses to a cross-reactive antigen may play a role in the pathogenesis of RA.","['Fox, R', 'Sportsman, R', 'Rhodes, G', 'Luka, J', 'Pearson, G', 'Vaughan, J']","['Fox R', 'Sportsman R', 'Rhodes G', 'Luka J', 'Pearson G', 'Vaughan J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens/*analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis/immunology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/etiology/*immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Microbial Collagenase/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rabbits', 'Synovial Membrane/*immunology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112469 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 May;77(5):1539-47. doi: 10.1172/JCI112469.,"['AM33294/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM33983/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC424557,,,,,,

The T leukemia cell Jurkat requires an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca++]i) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for the induction of IL-2 production, which is completely blocked by CsA. Another T cell line, HUT 78, also produces IL-2 in response to a rise in [Ca++]i and PMA; however, in HUT 78, PMA alone induces low levels of IL-2 production that is not blocked by CsA. After treatment with 5-azacytidine, HUT 78 cells produced maximal levels of IL-2 in response to PMA alone without requiring [Ca++]i increasing stimuli. In these cells no inhibitory effect of CsA on PMA-induced activation could be demonstrated. In addition, CsA does not inhibit PMA-induced translocation of protein kinase C. These data suggest that CsA does not globally inhibit IL-2 gene expression, but rather interferes with signaling events of T cell activation.","['Manger, B', 'Hardy, K J', 'Weiss, A', 'Stobo, J D']","['Manger B', 'Hardy KJ', 'Weiss A', 'Stobo JD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112464 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 May;77(5):1501-6. doi: 10.1172/JCI112464.,"['AI 14104/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM07304/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC424552,,,,,,

Using clonal selection it was found that phenotypic heterogeneity could readily be obtained and that subclones could be acquired that expressed a wide range of markers, typically in reproducible kinetic patterns, that were not detected on the parent clone. Previous results were confirmed showing that treatment with the drug 5-azacytidine (5-aza) prior to selection promoted the expression of the granulopoietic lineage associated antigen 80H.5 on MOLT-3 subclones; however, treatment with 5-aza appeared to inhibit substantially the expression of other novel markers by subclones following a second selection compared to untreated controls.

Although rapidly accumulated by cells, the intracellular concentration of NABD was less than 20% that of DNR at steady-state levels. The cellular uptake of both drugs by P388 cells was dependent on extracellular drug concentration in the medium and on temperature. The rapid efflux of NABD and DNR from P388 cells in drug-free medium was reduced at lowered temperature (0 degrees C). Cytofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that NABD was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, in contrast to the nuclear localization of DNR. NABD produced dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]thymidine (IC50 = 10.0 microM) and [3H]uridine (IC50 = 1.60 microM) incorporation in P388 cells to a lesser degree than DNR ([3H]thymidine, IC50 = 0.15 microM and [3H]uridine, IC50 = 0.70 microM). Continuous exposure to NABD inhibited P388 cell proliferation with an IC50 of 0.27 microM, compared with an IC50 of 0.017 microM for DNR. NABD is a pharmacologically active, photoactive analogue of DNR, which possesses properties different from those of the parent drug but similar to those of other anthracycline analogues.

Like 2-CldAdo, 2-BrdAdo is highly effective in inhibiting the growth of many T-lymphoblastoid, B-lymphoblastoid, and myeloid cell lines in culture. Concentrations required to inhibit growth of CCRF-CEM human T-lymphoblastoid cells by 50% (IC50) are: 2-CldAdo, 0.045 microM; 2-BrdAdo, 0.068 microM; dAdo, 0.9 microM in the presence of 5 microM erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine. Like dAdo, 2-BrdAdo causes a much greater decrease in DNA synthesis than in RNA and protein synthesis. For each of the nucleosides the concentration required to cause 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis (as measured by thymidine incorporation) in an 18-h exposure is very similar to the IC50 for growth and to the concentration required to decrease viability (clonogenicity) over 18 h by 50% (EC50). A fraction of CCRF-CEM cells (approximately equal to 30%) is resistant to killing by exposure to 2-BrdAdo or 2-CldAdo for 4 h at concentrations 100 times the EC50, but 3% of cells are resistant to exposure for 4 h to a concentration of dAdo 3 times the EC50. Each of the three nucleosides causes accumulation of cells in S phase, the accumulation becoming more marked with longer periods of exposure and with higher concentrations of nucleoside. During exposures for 18-24 h at a concentration of nucleoside near the EC50 most cells accumulate in S, with most in early S, whereas exposure to concentrations greater than EC95 accumulates cells at the G1/S border. This suggests that loss of viability is associated with a blockade of some process specifically occurring at the initiation of S phase. At an optimum dosage schedule, 2-BrdAdo and 2-CldAdo have similar therapeutic effects against L1210 in vivo, both producing over 99% cell kill, but the optimum dosage of 2-CldAdo is lower.","['Huang, M C', 'Ashmun, R A', 'Avery, T L', 'Kuehl, M', 'Blakley, R L']","['Huang MC', 'Ashmun RA', 'Avery TL', 'Kuehl M', 'Blakley RL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', ""89178-21-2 (2-bromo-2'-deoxyadenosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyadenosines/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA/biosynthesis']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 May;46(5):2362-8.,['P30-CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Enzyme-mediated hydrolysis was considerably greater (10-20-fold) on a specific activity basis in extracts from all normal mouse tissues (kidney greater than bone marrow greater than small intestine approximately equal to liver) than from tumor cells (Sarcoma 180 greater than Ehrlich approximately equal to L1210 cells). Enzyme preparations from purified absorptive and crypt cell epithelium from mouse small intestine exhibited comparable levels of specific activity and were greater than that derived from the total organ. Folyl hydrolase from mouse kidney showed mixed endo- and exopeptidase activity while that derived from all other normal tissues and tumor cells was consistent with endopeptidase activity. Levels of cell-free folyl hydrolase activity derived from tumor cells varied substantially with the phase of growth in vivo. Also, levels were appreciably lower from the same cells grown in vitro. Hydrolysis by crude or partially purified enzyme preparations from mouse small intestine or tumor cells conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics (single saturable component). Rates of hydrolysis and Km values were proportional to gamma-glutamyl chain length in the case of L1210 cell-derived enzyme but not for enzyme derived from small intestine. Km values derived for 4-amino-10-methylpteroyldiglutamate were the same [Km = 80.4 +/- 9 (SE) microM] for small intestine and L1210 cells. However, with 4-amino-10-methylpteroyltetraglutamate Km values were 3-fold lower for tumor cell preparations and 8-fold lower for preparations derived from small intestine. Fourfold lower Km values for 4-amino-10-methylpteroyldiglutamate were obtained with enzyme derived from Sarcoma 180 cells as compared to the enzyme from L1210 or intestinal cells. Varying levels of folyl hydrolase activity for methotrexate polyglutamates in cell-free preparations from different tumor cells appeared to reflect differences in in situ hydrolytic activity shown for the same substrate when internalized.

Cell surface marker techniques have made a major contribution to the understanding of the biology and classification of lymphoproliferative disorders by permitting the determination of the lymphoid (B- or T-cell) or monocytic lineage of the tumors. Because lymphoma cells often simulate the morphologic features and cell surface phenotype of their normal lymphocytic counterparts, it is difficult to discriminate normal from neoplastic lymphocytes. The authors have used representative monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to cell surface antigens to assess tumor cell surface antigens associated with various lymphoreticular cell lineages. Heteroantisera to the human malignancy-associated nucleolar antigen (HMNA) was utilized as a marker for neoplastic lymphoid cells as previously described. The use of double immunoenzymatic staining with both peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase allow us simultaneously to determine lymphoid lineage and malignancy on human lymphoma cells.

In vivo passaged 745 cells, as well as the clones derived thereof, did not release Friend virus (FV). Western blot analysis of the plasma membrane fractions of the virus nonproducer 745 cells revealed the lack of gp69/70 glycoprotein expression. At least 10 intraperitoneal passages of virus producer in vitro passaged of virus producer in vitro passaged 745 cells were necessary to obtain the selection of the virus nonproducer phenotype. In contrast in vivo passaged 3Cl-8 cells continued to produce FV even after 100 in vivo passages and expressed gp69/70 antigens to a similar extent as the original in vitro passaged FLC. The expression of F-MuLV and SFFV RNAs in virus producer and virus nonproducer FLC clones has been investigated by means of Northern blot technique using probes specific for either F-MuLV or SFFV. No F-MuLV specific RNA sequences were detected in virus nonproducer 745 clones. SFFV specific RNA transcripts and gp52/55 glycoprotein production could be revealed in all the FLC tested. Southern blot analysis showed the presence of F-MuLV specific sequences in the cellular DNA of virus nonproducer 745 clones. As both in vivo passaged F-MuLV producer 3Cl-8 and F-MuLV nonproducer 745 cells were equally barely immunogenic and highly malignant when injected into syngeneic DBA/2 mice, these results indicate that F-MuLV expression does not result per se in a high immunogenic potential of tumor cells. For the time being, as a specific property of 3Cl-8 versus 745 cells is the interferon-resistant phenotype, it is tempting to speculate that the selection of virus nonproducer cell variants after in vivo passages of interferon-sensitive 745 cells could depend on the presence of low levels of endogenous interferon in normal young mice.","['Oppi, C', 'Fiorucci, G', 'Ferrantini, M', 'Battistini, A', 'Belardelli, F']","['Oppi C', 'Fiorucci G', 'Ferrantini M', 'Battistini A', 'Belardelli F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phenotype', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis']",1986/04/30 00:00,1986/04/30 00:01,['1986/04/30 00:00'],"['1986/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(86)90304-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1986 Apr 30;150(2):390-401. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(86)90304-1.,,,,,,,,

A second CFU-F decrease was observed in the terminal phase of R-MuLV-induced chronic lymphoid or myeloid leukemias, but not in mice with a RLV-induced acute erythroleukemia, which are highly viremic. When a number of Rauscher virus transformed leukemic cell lines were injected intravenously an erythroid and a T-cell line suppressed CFU-F values, but a third non-virus producing B-cell line did not. In contrast to the in-vitro situation, in-vitro inhibition of CFU-F was only observed in conditioned medium of an erythroid cell line with undetectable reverse transcriptase activity, whereas conditioned medium of lymphoid and myeloid cell lines were not inhibitory irrespective of reverse transcriptase activity.

In pre-B and pre-T lymphoma cells transformed by A-MuLV, the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein has an MW of 160 kDa and shares immunologically detectable sequences with the v-abl oncogene product. Moreover, two different proteins of approximately 100 and 68 kDa, heavily phosphorylated at tyrosine, were identified. Lack of immunological cross-reactivity with viral products and phosphopeptide mapping showed that the 100 and 68 kDa proteins are coded by cellular genes. Phosphoproteins were undetectable in control resting lymphocytes. The 68 and the 100 kDa proteins were phosphorylated to different extents in proliferating lymphocytes, either stimulated by the growth factor IL-2, or transformed by M-MuLV (lacking the oncogene coded kinase). In fibroblasts transformed by A-MuLV, phosphotyrosine antibodies identified 2 proteins of 120 and 70 kDa. By immunological cross-reaction and by phosphopeptide mapping, the first was identified as a 120 kDa form of the v-abl coded kinase. The 70 kDa protein is coded by a cellular gene, is not structurally related to the 120 kDa v-abl kinase, and is different from any phosphotyrosine-containing protein detected in A-MuLV-transformed lymphocytes. These data show that, upon v-abl-induced transformation, phosphorylation at tyrosine takes place also on proteins other than the 160 or 120-kDa oncogene products. In lymphocytes and fibroblasts these proteins are different, suggesting that the cascade of events triggered by the v-abl gene in different cell types involves tyrosine phosphorylation of different specific proteins.","['Saggioro, D', 'Ferracini, R', 'Di Renzo, M F', 'Naldini, L', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Comoglio, P M']","['Saggioro D', 'Ferracini R', 'Di Renzo MF', 'Naldini L', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Comoglio PM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/analysis', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphopeptides/analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis/immunology/*metabolism']",1986/04/15 00:00,1986/04/15 00:01,['1986/04/15 00:00'],"['1986/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910370424 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 Apr 15;37(4):623-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910370424.,,,,,,,,

Planar bilayers were constructed from lipid vesicles containing the purified Fc epsilon R alone, or together with the cromolyn binding protein (CBP). Changes in conductivity of these bilayers were measured as a monitor for channel activity, following specific aggregation of Fc epsilon R. Antigen-induced, Fc epsilon R mediated channel activity could only be elicited in membranes containing both proteins. This conductance was abrogated upon disaggregating the complexes with a monovalent hapten (epsilon-N-DNP-L-lysine). No channel activity was observed following antigen-induced aggregation of Fc epsilon R if CBP was not present in the bilayer. The single channels recorded were of approximately equal to 2 pS conductance. The open-time values varied significantly with individual experiments and depended on the protein composition of the membrane and the nature of the aggregating agent. These observations strongly indicate that the Fc epsilon R isolated from RBL cells does not form cation (Ca++) channels by itself. Furthermore, in line with earlier reports, the present data suggest that the CBP is responsible for this activity, and that it interacts directly with Fc epsilon R to open channels upon aggregation.","['Mazurek, N', 'Dulic, V', 'Pecht, I', 'Schindler, H G', 'Rivnay, B']","['Mazurek N', 'Dulic V', 'Pecht I', 'Schindler HG', 'Rivnay B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (cromolyn binding protein, rat)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/ultrastructure', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Epitopes', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Ion Channels/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, IgE']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(86)90077-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(86)90077-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1986 Jan;12(1):31-5. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(86)90077-5.,,,,,,,,

A new technique for separating large cells and multicellular complexes from cell suspensions.,251-66,"A new and simple technique, zonal unit-gravity elutriation, has been devised for separating very large cells, multicellular complexes, or small organisms from suspensions consisting mainly of small cells. The separation vessel is a conical chamber with an entrance at the lower, narrower part of the cone and an exit at the upper, wider part of the cone via a dome-shaped lid. A baffle at the entrance prevents turbulence from incoming fluid. Chambers of differing widths and wall slopes are chosen depending on the sedimentation rate of the particles to be separated. A small volume of the cell suspension is placed in the chamber on the bench in a cold-room. Medium stabilized by a shallow density gradient is pumped into the base of the chamber and ascends, creating a decreasing velocity gradient. Cells sediment at unit-gravity against this ascending counterstream, and are separated into bands according to sedimentation velocity. By adjusting the flow rate of the medium, different sizes of cells can be separated. Tumor cells can be enriched, and larger blast cells can be separated from small cells in lymphoid cell suspensions. The procedure produces complete separation of thymic nurse cells (epithelial-lymphoid complexes) from free thymocytes in digested thymus suspensions and produces substantial enrichment of thymic rosettes (macrophage-lymphoid complexes). A very favorable situation for applying this technique is the isolation of Taenia taeniaformis larvae, which can be completely purified from infected liver suspensions, representing a 4 X 10(5)-fold enrichment of the parasites, with high recovery, in a single 30 min operation.","['Andrews, P', 'Shortman, K']","['Andrews P', 'Shortman K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Biophys,Cell biophysics,8002185,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Liver/parasitology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rheology', 'Rosette Formation', 'Taenia/isolation & purification', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02789437 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biophys. 1985 Dec;7(4):251-66. doi: 10.1007/BF02789437.,,,,,,,,

No appreciable reactivity has been found with anti-Tac MoAb in the four patients tested. In the absence of stimulation, the patients' LGL produced no IL-2 and only minimal amounts of IL-1 and interferon (IFN). On stimulation with lipopolysaccharides (for IL-1) or phytohaemagglutinin A (PHA) (for IL-2 and IFN), they produced IL-1 and IFN in amounts similar to those produced by normal lymphocytes, but only modest levels of IL-2. These results indicated that proliferating LGL, like normal LGL, have a secretory capacity.

The N-myc and c-myc genes have 5'-noncoding exons, strikingly homologous coding regions, and display similar oncogenic potential in an in vitro transformation assay. The L-myc gene is less well characterized, but shows homology to N-myc and c-myc (ref. 6; also see below). c-myc is expressed in most dividing cells, and deregulated expression of this gene has been implicated in the development of many classes of tumours. In contrast, expression of N-myc has been found only in a restricted set of tumours, most of which show neural characteristics; these include human neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). L-myc expression has so far been found only in SCLC. Activated N-myc and L-myc expression has been implicated in oncogenesis; for example, although N-myc expression has been found in all neuroblastomas tested, activated (greatly increased) N-myc expression, resulting from gene amplification, is correlated with progression of the tumour. We now report that high-level expression of N- and L-myc is very restricted with respect to tissue and stage in the developing mouse, while that of c-myc is more generalized. Furthermore, we demonstrate that N-myc is not simply a neuroectoderm-specific gene; both N- and L-myc seem to be involved in the early stages of multiple differentiation pathways. Our findings suggest that differential myc gene expression has a role in mammalian development and that the normal expression patterns of these genes generally predict the types of tumours in which they are expressed or activated.","['Zimmerman, K A', 'Yancopoulos, G D', 'Collum, R G', 'Smith, R K', 'Kohl, N E', 'Denis, K A', 'Nau, M M', 'Witte, O N', 'Toran-Allerand, D', 'Gee, C E']","['Zimmerman KA', 'Yancopoulos GD', 'Collum RG', 'Smith RK', 'Kohl NE', 'Denis KA', 'Nau MM', 'Witte ON', 'Toran-Allerand D', 'Gee CE', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice/*genetics/growth & development', '*Oncogenes', 'Plasmacytoma/genetics', 'RNA/analysis', 'Tissue Distribution']",1986/02/05 00:00,1986/02/05 00:01,['1986/02/05 00:00'],"['1986/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/319780a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1986 Feb 27-Mar 5;319(6056):780-3. doi: 10.1038/319780a0.,"['2-POI CA 23767/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HDO834/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

Immunophenotyes were those of common ALL (CALLA+, HLA-DR+) for six patients and of pre-B-cell ALL (positive cytoplasmic immunoglobulin) for one. However, blast cells from six of the seven patients also reacted with myeloid-associated monoclonal antibodies (MCS.2 and/or SJ-D1). The wide overlap in the percentages of blasts expressing CALLA and those expressing myeloid-associated antigens suggests that some cells possessed both lymphoid- and myeloid-associated surface antigens. By a dual staining technique, two patients tested had blasts expressing antigens of both lineages. Each child achieved a complete remission after treatment with agents effective for ALL and remains in remission for 13+ to 20+ months. These morphologic and immunologic findings may define a distinct subtype of acute leukemia.","['Pui, C H', 'Mirro, J', 'Woodruff, L', 'Motroni, T', 'Stass, S']","['Pui CH', 'Mirro J', 'Woodruff L', 'Motroni T', 'Stass S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*classification', 'Male', '*Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950140104 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1986;14(1):12-6. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950140104.,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR0558414/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

This resulted in rapid activation of nonspecific cytotoxic potential of the lymphocytes. Both originally noncytotoxic, high-density Percoll-fractionated cells, and cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cell-enriched low-density cells were activated. The induction of originally noncytotoxic cells into activated killer (AK) cells was apparently independent of interferon (IFN), whereas the activation of the NK cell-enriched fractions also involved IFN production. Neither the AK nor NK activity were associated with significant bactericidal activity. The IFN-independent induction of AK activity was not dependent on the O-antigenic polysaccharide part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the bacterial cell surface, because both smooth (S) strains with differing O-antigenic structures (S-4,12 and S-6,7) and a rough (Re) strain without O-antigen were effective inducers. Isolated LPS, and especially alkali-hydrolyzed (O-deacylated, detoxified) LPS (ALPS) interfered with the induction of cytotoxicity. At concentrations of 10 to 30 micrograms/ml, ALPS totally inhibited the induction of AK activity without affecting the endogenous NK activity. Thus contact with bacteria can lead to the emergence of AK cells, and a bacterial product can effectively block this activation. These phenomena stress the complexity of interactions with host defenses that can take place during bacterial infection.","['Tarkkanen, J', 'Saxen, H', 'Nurminen, M', 'Makela, P H', 'Saksela, E']","['Tarkkanen J', 'Saxen H', 'Nurminen M', 'Makela PH', 'Saksela E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Antigens, Bacterial/*immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Interferons/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Salmonella/*immunology/physiology', 'Time Factors']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Apr 1;136(7):2662-9.,['CA 23809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Enhanced responses with heavy water.",2583-92,"RBL-2H3 cells (a tumor analog of rat mast cells) have plasma-membrane receptors that bind immunoglobulin E, which when aggregated, initiate degranulation. As in other systems, secretion is preceeded by enhanced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and by a rise in intracellular Ca2+. Unlike the responses of many other cells, however, both of these earlier events require extracellular Ca2+. The relationship of these events to each other and to the subsequent secretory process is thus unclear. By exposing cells to covalent oligomers of IgE one can demonstrate substantial increases in secretion of histamine by increasing the concentration and size of the oligomers or by using heavy water (D2O) in the medium. We have used such maneuvers to examine the quantitative relationships between aggregation of the receptors and the breakdown of inositol phospholipids, the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and secretion. Our principal findings were: all treatments that increased secretion, correspondingly increased the changes that precede degranulation. These early events correlated with the degree of aggregation of the receptors even when the stimulatory conditions resulted in maximal secretion. Although the results were insufficient to prove that the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids is required for the rise in cytosolic Ca2+, the studies with D2O and other observations supported this view. Since a plasma-membrane ion channel for Ca2+ has been implicated in the IgE-mediated rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in RBL 2H3 cells, this in turn suggests a heretofore undescribed role for hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids.","['Maeyama, K', 'Hohman, R J', 'Metzger, H', 'Beaven, M A']","['Maeyama K', 'Hohman RJ', 'Metzger H', 'Beaven MA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'AR09D82C7G (Deuterium)', 'J65BV539M3 (Deuterium Oxide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Deuterium/*metabolism', 'Deuterium Oxide', '*Histamine Release', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Water/*metabolism']",1986/02/25 00:00,1986/02/25 00:01,['1986/02/25 00:00'],"['1986/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)35827-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Feb 25;261(6):2583-92.,,,,,,,,

From evaluating the proliferation of granulopoietic cells quantitatively, conclusions were made concerning the concentrations of granulopoietic stimulating substances in these sera. In all cultures with the serum of patients the number of granulopoietic cell colonies was greater than that in cultures with the serum of normal persons. The stronger proliferation of granulopoietic precursor cells in cultures with serum of patients is seen to be due to an enhanced production of the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by leukemic cells. The differential hemograms and curves indicating the course of leukocytes in patients are compared with the corresponding results of cultures. In patients with CML an increased output of GM-CSF will apparently influence the increase in size of the granulopoietic stem cell pool, which is evident in the steep increase of those curves indicating the course of leukocytes. In patients with OMS, however, there is a discrepancy between granulopoietic serum activity and proliferation in vivo. From these investigations the hypothesis is derived that an increased synthesis of GM-CSF in patients with CML may be one of the causes underlying hyperplastic granulopoiesis. A direct advantage of leukemic cells in proliferation cannot be derived from it.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Heilmann, E', 'Eitemoller, H']","['Heilmann E', 'Eitemoller H']",,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch,"Folia haematologica (Leipzig, Germany : 1928)",0374615,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*blood', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteosclerosis/blood', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch. 1985;112(6):886-900.,,,,,Serumfaktoren bei chronischer myeloischer Leukamie.,,,

In this study, a patient with type 2 hairy-cell leukemia was treated with one cycle of 2'-deoxycoformycin (4 mg/m2, i.v. weekly for 3 weeks), which was repeated at 9 wk. No toxicity was observed, and the hairy cell count fell from 72,000/mm3 to 5,000/mm3 in 3 mo, with a concomitant 50% decrease in the spleen size.

Additionally, the plasma levels of interferon did not change during therapy, making it unlikely that 2'-deoxycoformycin exerts its activity by inducing endogenous interferon synthesis.","['Johnston, J B', 'Begleiter, A', 'Pugh, L', 'Leith, M K', 'Wilkins, J A', 'Cavers, D J', 'Israels, L G']","['Johnston JB', 'Begleiter A', 'Pugh L', 'Leith MK', 'Wilkins JA', 'Cavers DJ', 'Israels LG']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Adenosine/blood', 'Adenosine Deaminase/analysis', '*Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/blood', 'Humans', 'Interferons/blood', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Apr;46(4 Pt 2):2179-84.,,,,,,,,

In this work the capacity of IFN to induce 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-A synthetase) in lymphoid cells from patients with CLL was investigated, and the results were related to the induction of blast transformation. IFN induced enhanced levels of 2',5'-A synthetase in unseparated lymphoid cells from 18 of 24 patients with CLL. In a control group of 11 healthy donors, 2',5'-A synthetase was induced in all cases tested. There was a close correlation between induction of 2',5'-A synthetase and induction of blast transformation by IFN. Thus, transformation occurred in clones expressing enhanced levels of 2',5'-A synthetase, but not in those showing no increase in 2',5'-A synthetase. An enhancement of 2',5'-A synthetase was observed in the IFN-sensitive cells following exposure to concentrations as low as 0.5 IFN units/ml. For induction of blast transformation, 10-1000 times more IFN was required. One h of pretreatment was sufficient for induction of 2',5'-A synthetase, whereas 20 h of pretreatment were required for induction of transformation by IFN. The finding that induction of 2',5'-A synthetase parallels interferon-induced blast transformation indicates that the reason why some CLL clones do not differentiate following exposure to IFN is a resistance of these cells to the action of IFN. The resistance to IFN in some CLL clones may be due to a defect in the 2',5'-A synthetase system of the cells, but it could also be at an early stage of the interaction between IFN and the cell, for instance at the receptor level.","['Ostlund, L', 'Einhorn, S', 'Robert, K H']","['Ostlund L', 'Einhorn S', 'Robert KH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['9008-11-1 (Interferons)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*biosynthesis"", 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Apr;46(4 Pt 2):2160-3.,,,,,,,,

The surviving tumor cells are fixed with ethanol and stained with crystal violet. After washing out the remaining crystal violet, 200 microliters of sodium lauryl sulfate is put into each microwell and the absorbance of each is measured. When we examined this method using leukemic cell lines, we found that the numbers of cells were in proportion to the absorbance, and that the surviving cells could be counted by the absorbance within the range of 0.4 to 1.7. On the assumption that the effective range is more than 60% of the cytotoxicity index (CI), tables of CI classified into drugs, concentrations and duration of culture for each leukemic cell line were made. With these tables, comparison of the anticancer drugs and subsequent selection of the effective ones became easier.

One of these antibodies, 43-13, detects an AKR-specific viral p12 determinant. A second monoclonal antibody, 43-17, detects a novel murine leukemia virus-related antigen found on glycosylated gag polyproteins (gp95gag, gp85gag, and gp55gag) on the surface of cells infected with and producing ecotropic endogenous viruses, but does not detect antigens within these virions. The 43-17 antibody immunoprecipitates the precursor of the cell surface gag protein whether in its glycosylated or unglycosylated state, but does not detect the cytoplasmic precursor of the virion gag proteins (Pr65gag). Based on these findings, we have localized the 43-17 determinant to the unique amino-terminal part of the glycosylated gag polyprotein (the L domain). We have determined that gp95gag contains L-p15-p12-p30-p10 determinants, whereas gp85gag lacks the carboxyterminal p10 determinant, and gp55gag lacks both p30 and p10 carboxy terminal determinants. Analysis of cell surface gag expression with the 43-17 antibody leads us to propose that the L domain plays a crucial role in (i) the insertion and orientation of murine leukemia virus gag polyproteins in the cell membrane and (ii) the relative abundance of expression of AKR leukemia virus versus Moloney murine leukemia virus glycosylated gag polyproteins in infected cells.","['Pillemer, E A', 'Kooistra, D A', 'Witte, O N', 'Weissman, I L']","['Pillemer EA', 'Kooistra DA', 'Witte ON', 'Weissman IL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Protein Precursors/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*immunology', 'Virion/immunology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.57.2.413-421.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Feb;57(2):413-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.57.2.413-421.1986.,['GM-07365/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC252752,,,,,,

K., D. Holowka, and B. Baird, 1984, J. Cell Biol. 98:577-583). Here we use fluorescence photobleaching recovery measurements to show that receptor oligomerization by this means is accompanied by a dramatic reduction of receptor lateral mobility, and that this immobilization occurs even when the clustering is not microscopically detectable. Furthermore, the degree of immobility induced by a particular oligomer fraction from a gel filtration column correlates positively with its ability to trigger cellular degranulation, whereas receptors labeled with monomeric IgE have no triggering activity and exhibit typical membrane protein mobility. The slow, large-scale oligomer-induced clustering appears to be a long term consequence of earlier selective interactions that result in receptor immobilization, and this highly clustered state provides a competent, noninhibitory triggering signal resulting in cellular degranulation upon warming to 37 degrees C. We conclude that even limited clustering of IgE receptors on rat basophilic leukemia cells induces interactions with other cellular components that constrain receptor mobility and eventually cause massive coalescence of the clusters.

In the present study, we show that media conditioned (LCM) by unstimulated mononuclear cells (MNC) from these patients can induce proliferation (proliferating inducing activity; PIA) and promote colony growth (T-cell colony promoting activity; T-CPA) of normal T lymphocytes in the absence of any other mitogenic stimulation. Preincubation of normal E+ lymphocytes with some TCPA+, PIA(-)-LCM for 48 hr leads to IL2-induced cell proliferation in the absence of any other stimulation. Moreover, staining of the cells with anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (Mab) reveal 9%-26% Tac+ cells. Both PIA and IL2 receptor-inducing activities were abrogated by treatment of LCM with proteolytic enzymes or by heating at 47 degrees C for 30 min. Modulation of the T3 molecule by OKT3 MAb on normal E+ cells did not abrogate the capacity of LCM to induce expression of IL2-receptors, suggesting that this activity was not mediated by triggering the Ti-T3 molecular complex. These activities were detected in media conditioned by both unfractionated MNC and blast-enriched cell fractions, and their production required DNA and RNA synthesis by actively dividing cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that human leukemic T cells spontaneously release activities which can activate normal resting T lymphocytes.","['Kosmatopoulos, C', 'Allouche, M', 'Triebel, F', 'Zanti, M', 'Clemenceau, C', 'Gluckman, J C', 'Jasmin, C', 'Georgoulias, V']","['Kosmatopoulos C', 'Allouche M', 'Triebel F', 'Zanti M', 'Clemenceau C', 'Gluckman JC', 'Jasmin C', 'Georgoulias V']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1986/02/15 00:00,1986/02/15 00:01,['1986/02/15 00:00'],"['1986/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910370213 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 Feb 15;37(2):247-53. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910370213.,,,,,,,,

These were one adult and 2 pediatric patients that had other ALL markers and achieved a complete remission with appropriate ALL therapy. One of the BL6+ cases relapsed after 19 months with a change in phenotype to BL1+ BL2+ BL5- BL6-.

Blood neutrophils did not express the antigen. Weak immunofluorescent staining of cell nuclei was observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes and in sections of normal human kidney, tonsil and skin epithelium. The AGF2.3 antigen was strongly expressed on the nuclei of 21/21 haemopoietic cell lines and 21/25 permanent non-haemopoietic cell lines representing various cell types. In contrast, the antigen was not expressed by any of six primary (untransformed) cell cultures. These included fibroblasts, endothelial cells and keratinocytes. The antigen was expressed in the Q10 SV-40 transformed cell line derived from a non-expressing primary fibroblast culture. AGF2.3 antibody precipitated a protein with an apparent subunit molecular weight of approximately 215 kDa from Triton X-100 extracts of HL60 and HeLa cells labelled with 35S-methionine.

In addition to the C-type retrovirus particles related to Rauscher murine leukemia virus (MuLV) previously reported to bud from these cells we observed cytoplasmic A-type particles and intracisternal A-type particles (IAP). In the cytoplasm the A-type particles occur in large clusters often associated with sheets of material with a fine structure resembling the shells of the particles. At the plasma membrane individual A-type particles bud to give rise to extracellular virions. The IAP are restricted to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) into which they bud: they are not transported out of the RER to the Golgi apparatus and beyond. We describe a new monoclonal antibody (designated 83E7) which is specific for an epitope of the major core protein (MTVp27) of mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). Using immunogold labelling procedures we have specifically labelled both the A-type particles and the associated sheets of material with this antibody. We conclude that the A-type particles and the virions they give rise to are MMTV.

In order to study the biochemical parameters affecting MP activity, leukemic cells were obtained from ten patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the time of diagnosis and from the same patients at the time of their initial marrow relapse. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), the enzyme that converts MP to its active, nucleotide metabolite, thioinosine monophosphate; alkaline phosphatase, the primary catabolic enzyme of thioinosine monophosphate; and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), the cellular ribose-phosphate donor essential for MP activation, were all measured within the patients' leukemic cells. There was marked interpatient variability in the three biochemical parameters studied with a greater than 10-fold range in alkaline phosphatase activity and an approximately 100-fold range in HPRT activity and PRPP levels. Four patients developed changes in biochemical parameters that influence MP activity at the time of relapse. In three of the four patients, alterations in more than one of these three biochemical parameters were noted.

Two of four patients demonstrated changes in all three parameters at relapse in the directions that could have resulted in decreased MP sensitivity (i.e., decreased HPRT, decreased PRPP, and increased alkaline phosphatase). There was no correlation between pretreatment values of HPRT, PRPP, and alkaline phosphatase and remission duration.

It was found that in most cases leukemic cells proliferate slower than normal cells. Immature cells after division either died, entered into a resting state, or re-entered the cell cycle. However, classical kinetic features were inconclusive when used as predictors of prognosis. Most drug studies were done by measuring the percent of cells in various phases of the cell cycle from samples of bone marrow obtained before and after giving a drug or drug combination. All drugs used commonly in the treatment of ANLL, except 6-thioguanine, were evaluated singly and some in combination. Some phase of the cell cycle was affected by all of the drugs in most patients. The percent of cells arrested and the time of greatest response varied with the dose.

The enzyme exhibited higher activity in the presence of Mg2+ than in the presence of Mn2+ with endogenous RNA as well as with almost all of the synthetic template X primers tested. Mg2+ was also effective with poly(2'-O-methylcytidylate) X oligodeoxyguanylate which was known to be specific for Mn2+. To examine the immunological relatedness of this enzyme with other retroviral DNA polymerases, remaining Sm-MTV DNA polymerase activity was measured after treatment of this enzyme with various antisera prepared against each of the reverse transcriptases of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), murine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV), simian sarcoma virus-simian sarcoma associated virus (SSV/SSAV), and Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV). No inhibition of the Sm-MTV enzyme activity was observed when treated with the latter three antisera with which the DNA polymerase activities of the corresponding retroviruses were fully inhibited. Only the antiserum against MPMV-enzyme, however, was found to slightly inhibit the Sm-MTV enzyme activity. These results indicate that Sm-MTV DNA polymerase has similar enzymological properties to those of MPMV and MuMTV and shares some common antigenic determinant group(s) with MPMV DNA polymerase.","['Yokoi, T', 'Nakane, H', 'Hayakawa, S', 'Saga, S', 'Nagayoshi, S', 'Tsutsui, Y', 'Aoyama, A', 'Hoshino, M', 'Ono, K']","['Yokoi T', 'Nakane H', 'Hayakawa S', 'Saga S', 'Nagayoshi S', 'Tsutsui Y', 'Aoyama A', 'Hoshino M', 'Ono K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Manganese/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/microbiology/veterinary', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/immunology/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/classification/*enzymology/isolation & purification', 'Shrews/microbiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Viral Proteins/immunology/*isolation & purification/metabolism']",1986/01/30 00:00,1986/01/30 00:01,['1986/01/30 00:00'],"['1986/01/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/30 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(86)90324-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1986 Jan 30;148(2):268-74. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(86)90324-7.,,,,,,,,

The second--anti-HuLy-m2, reactive with T cells, some B cells, and null cells--could stimulate and not block NK activity. The enhancement of NK cell function by anti-HuLy-m2 was not related to interferon stimulation, and neither antibody altered effector:target cell binding. When used together neither augmentation nor blocking effects were observed, indicating different sites of reaction with NK cells. To further explore a possible association between T cell and NK antigens, anti-HuLy-m1 and -m2 were used to investigate certain T cell functions. Neither antibody was mitogenic for peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) or blocked PHA stimulation of PBLs. In addition anti-HuLy-m1 did not inhibit a mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) but could inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) almost as effectively as OKT3.

The major obstacle to complete remission is selection and overgrowth of a permanent, drug-resistant, neoplastic cell population. For this reason, a number of investigators have tested the efficacy of two or more non-cross-resistant regimens delivered in alternating fashion. In stage IV Hodgkin's disease, the MOPP-ABVD program increases the cure rate by 15% to 20% compared with MOPP alone. With intensive polydrug regimens, at least 50% of patients with diffuse large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) can now be cured. The risk of treatment-induced acute leukemias as well as sterility can be avoided or greatly decreased with drug combinations not including procarbazine HCI and alkylating agents. Effective salvage regimens for lymphomas resistant to primary chemotherapy have been described in part for Hodgkin's disease; a number of second-line treatments can probably cure 20% to 25% of MOPP-resistant patients. Encouraging results that require confirmation have also been reported in the treatment of relapsing NHL with drug combinations including cisplatin (Platinol), cytosine arabinoside, etoposide (VP-16), ifosfamide, and amsacrine.

It has been suggested that ion channels are involved in the killing process because there is a Ca-dependent stage and because killings by presensitized cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which in many respects resembles NK killing, is associated with changes in K and Na transport in the target cell. However, no direct evidence exists for ion channels in NK cells or in their target cells. Using the whole-cell variation of the patch-clamp technique, we found a voltage-dependent potassium (K+) current in NK cells. The K+ current was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by the K-channel blockers 4-aminopyridine and quinidine and by the traditional Ca-channel blockers verapamil and Cd2+. We tested the effects of ion-channel blockers on killing of two commonly used target cell lines: K562, which is derived from a human myeloid leukemia, and U937, which is derived from a human histiocytic leukemia. Killing of K562 target cells, determined in a standard 51Cr-release assay, was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by verapamil, quinidine, Cd2+, and 4-aminopyridine at concentrations comparable to those that blocked the K+ current in NK cells. In K562 target cells only a voltage-dependent Na+ current was found and it was blocked by concentrations of tetrodotoxin that had no effect on killing. Killing of U937 target cells was also inhibited by the two ion-channel blockers tested, quinidine and verapamil. In this cell line only a small K+ current was found that was similar to the one in NK cells. We could not find any evidence of a Ca2+ current in target cells or in NK cells; therefore, our results cannot explain the Ca dependence of killing. Our findings show that there are K channels in NK cells and that these channels play a necessary role in the killing process. In contrast, the endogenous channel type in the target cell is probably not a factor in determining target cell sensitivity to natural killing.","['Schlichter, L', 'Sidell, N', 'Hagiwara, S']","['Schlichter L', 'Sidell N', 'Hagiwara S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'BH3B64OKL9 (4-Aminopyridine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['4-Aminopyridine', 'Aminopyridines/pharmacology', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*physiology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Potassium/*physiology', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.2.451 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jan;83(2):451-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.2.451.,"['CA12582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC322877,,,,,,

In immunofluorescence assays with various human hematopoietic cells, H-31 and H-A26 antibodies both reacted with only IL-2 R-positive cells, and they precipitated IL-2 R molecules, glycoproteins with molecular weights of 60K and 53K daltons (gp60/gp53), from human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-carrying MT-2 cells, as demonstrated by sequential immunoprecipitation after absorption of IL-2 R with anti-Tac. Antibody-binding competition assays showed that H-31 and anti-Tac, and H-A26 and HIEI, respectively, competed reciprocally in binding to the cells, and that anti-Tac also inhibited the binding of HIEI but not vice versa. H-31, like anti-Tac, strongly inhibited the IL-2-dependent proliferation of normal activated T-cells, absorption of IL-2 and direct binding of IL-2 to the cells, while H-A26, like HIEI, inhibited those processes only weakly. The spectra of reactivities of these antibodies with various simian cell lines derived by HTLV-I infection were different, as revealed by immunofluorescence studies. Human IL-2 R was shown to express a unique antigenic determinant, detected with HIEI, that was not detectable in IL-2 R molecules of Old and New World monkeys, and also to express determinants common to simian IL-2 R molecules. These observations indicate that H-31 and H-A26 recognize human IL-2 R molecules and that the antigenic sites on the IL-2 R molecule defined by H-31, H-A26, anti-Tac, and HIEI are different.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Tozawa, H', 'Hayami, M', 'Sugamura, K', 'Hinuma, Y']","['Tanaka Y', 'Tozawa H', 'Hayami M', 'Sugamura K', 'Hinuma Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1985.tb02960.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1985;29(10):959-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1985.tb02960.x.,,,,,,,,

We have now recovered a revertant of the virus after abortive infection of mouse cells and have determined the structure of the new virus. The revertant is a recombinant virus containing a 500-base-pair patch of new sequences derived from the mouse genome. The integration site was perfectly restored to the wild-type sequence, although the patch of DNA was overall only 80% homologous to Moloney murine leukemia virus. Surprisingly, the tRNA primer binding site was no longer homologous to the usual proline tRNAs, but was a perfect match for glutamine tRNA. This result suggests that the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase is not specific to one tRNA, but can utilize different tRNAs to prime the synthesis of viral DNA. Comparisons with published reports allowed the identification of sequences that are 94% homologous to the patch sequence, present in one of the endogenous retroviral sequences of the mouse. No replication-competent members of this family, utilizing the glutamine tRNA primer, have been previously isolated.","['Colicelli, J', 'Goff, S P']","['Colicelli J', 'Goff SP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Mice/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'RNA/physiology', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/physiology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.57.1.37-45.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Jan;57(1):37-45. doi: 10.1128/JVI.57.1.37-45.1986.,['CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC252696,,"['GENBANK/M12275', 'GENBANK/M17739']",,,,

We evaluated the clinical use of fludarabine given as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for remission induction in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Thirty infusions were administered to 25 patients. At doses less than or equal to 125 mg/m2/d for five days, only three of 17 patients cleared their bone marrow of leukemic cells, and none achieved complete remission (CR). Nine patients received doses of 150 mg/m2/d for five days or 125 mg/m2/d for seven days. Four of these patients achieved CR (three patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), one patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL]. However, severe CNS toxicity was encountered in five patients at the two highest dose levels. Initial symptoms of neurotoxicity were delayed from 21 to 43 days after starting treatment and consisted of optic neuritis, cortical blindness, altered mental status, and generalized seizure. Only one patient regained visual and neurologic function; four other patients experienced progressive neurologic deterioration and died. Clinicopathologic evaluation suggested widespread, severe demyelination as the etiology of these reactions. We conclude that fludarabine is an effective drug for remission induction in acute leukemia. However, doses required to achieve CR are associated with unacceptable CNS toxicity. In view of its potent antileukemic activity, further evaluation of fludarabine at lower doses (less than or equal to 75 mg/m2/d for five days) may be warranted in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with acute leukemia.","['Warrell, R P Jr', 'Berman, E']","['Warrell RP Jr', 'Berman E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Arabinonucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System/*drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use/toxicity']",1986/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.1.74 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Jan;4(1):74-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.1.74.,['N01-CM-8426/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Partial characterization and spectrum of activity against normal and malignant hemopoietic cells.,18-40,"Human T leukemia cell lines spontaneously release into their medium a suppressor lymphokine, T leukemia-derived suppressor lymphokine (TLSL), able to inhibit proliferation, DNA synthesis, and colony formation in a variety of malignant hemopoietic cell lines, as well as in normal myelomonocytic progenitor cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood. Titration curves indicated that the inhibitory activity in the crude supernatant preparations ranged from 10(-3)-10(-9): the supernatants from CCRF/CEM, HUT-78, and MOLT-4 cell lines were the most active, those from HPB-ALL, JM, and CCRF/HSB2 displayed an intermediate activity, and the Jurkat supernatant was the least active. Target cell lines of B cell origin (Burkitt lymphomas) were more sensitive than granulocytic, monocytic, erythroid, and T cell lines. Partial purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography demonstrated that TLSL is a protein with an Mr of 88,000, as determined by gel filtration. A high Mr form (greater than 300,000) was produced in serum-free medium by one of the most active producer cell lines (CCRF/CEM), and appeared to be an aggregate of the 88,000 Mr form. Neither the partially purified fractions obtained nor the crude supernatant preparations displayed antiviral activity or contained interleukin 2. Unlike lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor, TLSL is cytostatic: maximal inhibition of proliferation was observed 4-5 d after addition of crude supernatant to the target cells, and was not accompanied by a significant loss in cell viability. The antiproliferative capacity of TLSL was manifested both in suspension and methylcellulose cultures. Treated target cells accumulated either in the G1 or in the S phase of the cell cycle. The effect of TLSL on the target cells is irreversible: even brief (1 h) incubation of sensitive cells with TLSL resulted in inhibition of proliferation measured 5 d later. Although TLSL is produced by leukemic T cell lines, this lymphokine inhibits proliferation of normal peripheral blood T cells in response to mitogens or alloantigens: T lymphocyte activation was inhibited by all of the T cell supernatants tested. In contrast, when T cell lines were used as targets, no inhibition of proliferation was detected with two exceptions: the low producer Jurkat cell line was sensitive to all the T cell-derived supernatants, and the intermediate producer CCRF/HSB2 cell line was sensitive only to the three most active supernatants, CCRF/CEM, MOLT-4, and HUT-78. The possible significance of TLSL and its relationship with other suppressor lymphokines previously described in other systems is discussed.","['Santoli, D', 'Tweardy, D J', 'Ferrero, D', 'Kreider, B L', 'Rovera, G']","['Santoli D', 'Tweardy DJ', 'Ferrero D', 'Kreider BL', 'Rovera G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferons/analysis', 'Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.163.1.18 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1986 Jan 1;163(1):18-40. doi: 10.1084/jem.163.1.18.,"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-11036/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05540/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2188018,,,,,,

The liposomes were made from distearoyl phosphatidyl choline (DSPC), distearoyl phosphatidyl glycerol (DSPG), and cholesterol. In all cases, liposome binding was due to recognition of phosphatidyl choline by the surface IgM on the tumor cells. Liposome binding could be inhibited by DSPC but not by DSPG, and the number of liposomes bound per cell was directly related to the cell surface concentration of IgM. The IgM secreted by a hybridoma derived from one of the lymphomas, CH12, was shown to agglutinate liposomes, and was used in a solid-phase immunoassay to study inhibition of liposome binding by pure phospholipids; DSPC and sphingomyelin both inhibited, whereas DSPG did not. The Ig borne by the six lymphomas that bind phosphatidylcholine also bind to both SRBC and bromelain-treated mouse erythrocytes.

Immunohistochemical studies showed that the protease was located not only in intracytoplasmic granules but also in organelles synthesizing protein, such as cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, perinuclear spaces, and the Golgi apparatus. However, no immunoreactivity was demonstrated in rat basophils.

Cell sorting experiments showed that the majority subpopulations of small cortical and medullary thymocytes in control mice were noncycling and were predominantly in the Go phase of the cell cycle. Of the 15 to 20% cycling thymic lymphoblasts, approximately 50% were in the G1 phase, 35% were in the S phase, and 15% were in the G2 + M phases of the cell cycle. Cycling cells appeared to consist of a major subpopulation with low RNA content and a minority subpopulation with high RNA content. In virus-injected mice, no changes in cell cycling were observed at stage I of leukemogenesis (30 to 40 days postinjection), at which time infection of thymocytes by MCF virus is maximum and constant but no clonality is evident. Thus, MCF virus infection of thymocytes per se does not appear to alter cell proliferation. Increased cell cycling and a shift in cell cycle distribution to more cells in G1 was observed at stage II of leukemogenesis (50 to 60 days postinjection), at which time a clonally expanded cell population is known to emerge in thymuses of injected mice. Acridine orange staining resolved these novel cycling cells from subpopulations of normal thymic lymphoblasts on the basis of intermediate RNA content. The transition from stage II to stage III (50 to 60 days postinjection) was accompanied by the outgrowth of a major cycling population with a distinct, often increased, RNA content. As a result, the residual ""normal"" background of cycling cells often observed in stage II was markedly reduced or completely absent by stage III. Populations of cycling blasts from mice with frank leukemia differed from those at stage III by a variability in mean RNA content and in cell cycle distribution indicative of individual tumor heterogeneity. In addition, thymomas often contained multiple populations of cycling blasts that could be resolved by their discrete RNA distributions. Simultaneous staining of DNA and RNA by acridine orange appears particularly well-suited for studying a heterogeneous population of cycling and noncycling cells represented by mouse thymus. This method has permitted a rapid and quantitative analysis of cell cycle parameters at progressive stages of viral leukemogenesis in AKR mice.","[""O'Donnell, P V"", 'Traganos, F']","[""O'Donnell PV"", 'Traganos F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/*pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jan;136(2):720-7.,"['CA 16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31491/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Peripheral T cells of two donors were stimulated with allogeneic cells, and the 3D6+ cells were enriched by rosetting 3D6-coated cells with goat anti-mouse-coupled human red blood cells and were expanded in interleukin 2-containing medium. In this way, 90 to 100% 3D6+ cell lines were obtained that were cytotoxic for the allogeneic stimulator cells. 3D6 antibody could block antigen-specific cytotoxicity, as well as induce nonspecific cytotoxicity toward target cells that could not be killed in the absence of the 3D6 antibody. The 3D6+ cell populations contained T4+, as well as T8+ cells, indicating that 3D6 antibody defined a T cell receptor population that might harbor various antigenic specificities. One 3D6+ cell line was separated into T4+ T8- and T4- T8+ populations. 3D6 reactive T cell receptors isolated from HPB-ALL and normal cell lines were analyzed biochemically by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and V8 protease peptide mapping. Isoelectric focusing analysis provided additional evidence for the idea that 3D6 antibody detected a number of structurally distinct T cell receptors, because the T cell receptor alpha-chain was homogeneous in charge after desialation on the clonal tumor line HPB-ALL, but remained heterogeneous in charge on the 3D6+ normal cell lines. No great differences in charge were found between T cell receptors isolated from T4+ and T8+ 3D6+ lines, but their isoelectric focusing patterns were not identical. V8 protease peptide mapping revealed structural differences between the T cell receptor alpha-chain isolated from HPB-ALL on one hand and from the normal 3D6+ lines on the other, whereas the beta-chains did not differ greatly in primary structure according to this analysis. In addition, the peptide mapping suggested differences in primary structure between T cell receptors present on the T4+ population vs those present on the T8+ populations.","['Borst, J', 'Boylston, A W', 'de Vries, J E', 'Spits, H']","['Borst J', 'Boylston AW', 'de Vries JE', 'Spits H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/physiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/analysis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology/metabolism']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jan;136(2):601-8.,,,,,,,,

This augmented lysis is presumably caused by IFN increasing expression of target MHC antigens.

The compound is also a potent inducer of differentiation of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line known as HL-60. The induction of differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells to functional end cells offers an appealing therapeutic prospect. We investigated the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 both to induce in vitro the differentiation of blast cells taken from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and to improve hematopoiesis in vivo in patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes (preleukemia). We found that high concentrations (10-6 M) of 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly induced the in vitro differentiation of blast cells as measured by morphology, phagocytosis, and superoxide production. A concentration of 10-9 M 1,25(OH)2D3 had no effect on blast cell differentiation. We gave 2 microgram/day of 1,25(OH)2D3 to 18 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (preleukemia) in an attempt to improve their hematopoiesis. During therapy, their peak peripheral blood granulocyte, platelet, and macrophage concentrations were slightly elevated as compared to their baseline, starting levels. Eight patients had a partial or minor peripheral blood response to the compound during the administration of 1,25(OH)2D3. However, no patient showed significant improvement of peripheral blood cell or marrow blast cell counts by the end of the study (greater than or equal to 12 weeks) as compared to their starting levels. Seven of the patients developed leukemia before or by 12 weeks of treatment. Nine of the 18 patients developed hypercalcemia. Taken together, the study shows that high concentrations (10-6M) of 1,25(OH)2D3 can induce differentiation of leukemia blast cells in vitro, but the administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 to patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes (preleukemia) does not have an enduring therapeutic effect. Hypercalcemia prevented administering greater amounts of 1,25(OH)2D3. In the future, the use of new vitamin D analogs that induce hematopoietic cell differentiation without inducing hypercalcemia might allow the achievement of higher blood levels of the inducing compound and might be medically useful for selected preleukemic and leukemic patients.","['Koeffler, H P', 'Hirji, K', 'Itri, L']","['Koeffler HP', 'Hirji K', 'Itri L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,['FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Calcitriol/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/chemically induced', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Platelet Count', 'Preleukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Staining and Labeling']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1985 Dec;69(12):1399-407.,"['CA-26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

H. Matherly, D. W. Fry, and I. D. Goldman, Cancer Res., 43: 2694-2699, 1983). To further assess the importance of these interactions to leucovorin rescue, antifolate growth inhibition toward L1210 cells in the presence of leucovorin was correlated with the metabolism of (6S)-5-formyl tetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate as a measure of dihydrofolate reductase activity. Growth inhibition (greater than 95%) by methotrexate (5-10 microM) following its intracellular polyglutamylation during a 3-h preexposure, or by continuous treatment with high levels of the lipophilic antifolate, trimetrexate (1 microM), was only slightly diminished by 10 microM leucovorin (15-25%). High-pressure liquid chromatographic analyses of the derivatives formed from radiolabeled (6S)-5-formyl tetrahydrofolate under these conditions showed an incomplete conversion to dihydrofolate and metabolism to predominantly 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate. Neither of the antifolates interfered appreciably with the metabolism of the folate derivatives to polyglutamates. Growth inhibition in the presence of leucovorin correlated with the accumulation of dihydrofolate (1.5-2.2 nmol) from radiolabeled (6S)-5-formyl tetrahydrofolate, reflecting continued suppression of dihydrofolate reductase activity at these drug concentrations. With lower equitoxic levels of the trimetrexate (7.5 nM), the provision of leucovorin allowed for a restoration of cell growth to a level greater than 90% of control. Under these conditions, control levels of dihydrofolate (0.2 nmol) were formed from radiolabeled cofactor, consistent with sustained dihydrofolate reductase activity. These findings support a role for the activation of dihydrofolate reductase as an important component of the reversal of the effects of diaminoantifolates by leucovorin, presumably by a competitive displacement of drug from the enzyme. Since no displacement occurs in cells which have accumulated methotrexate polyglutamates, or in the presence of high levels of trimetrexate, it appears that the concentration of unbound drug within cells is a significant determinant of the extent of this competitive binding interaction. From these considerations, the high levels of methotrexate polyglutamates that accumulate in sensitive tumors relative to bone marrow and gastrointestinal cells would appear to represent an important factor for the selectivity of leucovorin rescue in vivo.","['Matherly, L H', 'Barlowe, C K', 'Goldman, I D']","['Matherly LH', 'Barlowe CK', 'Goldman ID']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Leucovorin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/metabolism', 'Trimetrexate']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Feb;46(2):588-93.,"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Regeneration of hemopoietic cells was evident during the second week following transplantation when a cellular, predominantly erythroid, marrow was present. Studies of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells obtained 21 days posttransplant showed that bone marrow and peripheral blood BFU-E-derived erythroblasts displayed typical fetal patterns of globin chain synthesis (gamma/gamma + beta ratios: 0.87 to 0.98). In addition, all of the individually analyzed erythroid clones displayed a fetal type of globin program, suggesting that the presence of rare, partially switched clones was unlikely. Additional evidence supported the fetal phenotype of these progenitors. The il expression of culture-derived erythroblasts was typical for fetal erythroid cells. As in fetal cells, fetal sheep serum influenced neither the globin nor the il phenotypes, and the growth characteristics were as those observed in fetal liver cultures. That these fetal progenitors matured in vivo and produced cells with a fetal program was shown by the pattern of globin biosynthesis in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood reticulocytes (gamma/gamma + beta ratios: 0.85 to 0.95) at days 14 and 21 posttransplantation. These results indicate that the transplanted fetal cells, in spite of their proliferation and differentiation in the environment of the recipient, continued to express during the early posttransplantation period fetal patterns of globin, surface antigenic determinants, and growth and response to environmental modulation.

LC molecules on myeloid cells do not carry the 'restricted' antigenic determinant. We have investigated the differential expression of these LC epitopes on human leukaemias, using immunofluorescence on fresh leukaemic blasts and established cell lines. Our study shows that, as on normal haemopoietic cells, LC molecules on B leukaemias bear both 'framework' and 'restricted' epitopes, while the majority of T leukaemias bear only the 'framework' determinant.

Other size classes included elements with major deletions in gag or pol. A genomic DNA analysis suggested that the majority of endogenous elements were close to full length in size and that the highly truncated sequences which we described previously (Soe et al., J.

In addition to transcripts consistent with full-length and spliced env retroviral RNAs, several unique RNA species which lack the env sequence accumulate in a tissue-specific manner. These RNA species are presumed to be transcribed from endogenous retroviral sequences that constitute the bulk of the murine leukemia virus-related sequences in the murine genome. To determine the relationship of these RNA transcripts to infectious murine leukemia virus and the precise structural basis of the heterogeneity observed for the env-lacking transcripts, we isolated and sequenced cDNA recombinants representing the RNAs expressed in strain 129 GIX+ mice. Comparisons of the nucleotide sequences demonstrated that the endogenous retroviral transcripts differed in pol, p15E, and R-peptide regions by single nucleotide changes. In contrast, the gp70-coding regions of two cDNA clones derived from epididymis and liver were completely homologous over a 599-nucleotide overlapping sequence. The structures of env-lacking transcripts were examined in two independent cDNA clones, and each was found to contain a different deletion that was potentially mediated by seven-base pair direct repeats in the intact sequence. The extensive sequence homology between cDNAs allowed construction of a cumulative sequence map of the 3' end of an intact endogenous retroviral transcript. A comparison of this sequence with infectious ecotropic and mink cell focus-forming viruses revealed that the endogenous transcripts are highly homologous with the substituted portions of leukemogenic mink cell focus-forming viruses and therefore further define the boundaries of recombination required to generate these viruses.","['Levy, D E', 'Lerner, R A', 'Wilson, M C']","['Levy DE', 'Lerner RA', 'Wilson MC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.56.3.691-700.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Dec;56(3):691-700. doi: 10.1128/JVI.56.3.691-700.1985.,"['CA-27489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07616/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC252638,,"['GENBANK/M11301', 'GENBANK/M12312', 'GENBANK/M12313', 'GENBANK/M12314', 'GENBANK/M12315']",,,,

The CD3+, CD16+ cells were established in short-term culture using growth medium containing interleukin 2 (IL-2). Both the freshly isolated cells and the cultured cell line stably expressed the CD3+, CD16+ phenotype. Furthermore, a majority of these T cells lacked either CD4 or CD8 expression. Like in vitro-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, the CD3+, CD16+ cells showed numerous azurophilic granules. Although these cells failed to mediate significant levels of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity even after stimulation with IL-2, they efficiently functioned as effectors of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The Ig isotype specificity of the ADCC was analyzed using an isotype switch-variant family of a murine anti-HLA monoclonal antibody (mAb). Similar to the CD3-, CD16+ NK cell population, the CD3+, CD16+ T cells preferentially used the IgG2a antibody to mediate ADCC. The CD3+, CD16+ cells demonstrated a proliferative response when cocultured with either a NK-sensitive tumor cell line, K562, or a NK-insensitive B lymphoblastoid cell line, CCRF-SB. The response against CCRF-SB was significantly inhibited by anti-IL-2 receptor antibody, whereas the response against K562 was only partially diminished. Cytotoxicity was also induced in the CD3+, CD16+ population by the presence of anti-CD3 mAb, indicating that cytotoxicity can be triggered by stimulation via the CD3-T cell antigen receptor complex. By isolating these CD3+, CD16+ cells from the peripheral blood of a normal, healthy individual, it has been possible to extensively study the morphology, antigenic phenotype, and functional behavior of this unique subset of T lymphocytes expressing IgG FcR.","['Lanier, L L', 'Kipps, T J', 'Phillips, J H']","['Lanier LL', 'Kipps TJ', 'Phillips JH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/classification/*immunology/metabolism']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.162.6.2089 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Dec 1;162(6):2089-106. doi: 10.1084/jem.162.6.2089.,['CA04681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2187997,,,,,,

Prominent among these is the release of arachidonic acid from cellular phospholipids, which could be due to the activation of phospholipase enzymes. In the present experiments we studied the intracellular activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) during histamine release. RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated through the IgE receptor, and the homogenates were prepared and tested for phospholipase A2 activity on 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine. The amount of activity in the homogenates was dependent on the concentration of secretagogue used to activate the cells. Under optimal conditions there was a 1.86 +/- 0.12-fold (mean +/- SEM, N = 44) increase in the activity found in homogenates of stimulated cells. Activity was present in homogenates prepared 30 sec after cell activation, was optimal between 5 and 10 min, and decreased later. In time course experiments the PLA2 activation preceded histamine release. The activation of the enzyme in the cell occurred in the presence of 10 microM EGTA in the extracellular medium, which completely inhibited release of arachidonic acid and histamine. However, the activity of the enzyme required Ca2+. The PLA2 activity in the homogenates and the extent of cell stimulation for histamine release were maximal at the same concentration of antigen, and both were blocked by the addition of a monovalent hapten. The enzyme in the homogenates was capable of cleaving arachidonic acid from different phospholipids. The production of lysophospholipids could play a critical role in histamine release from cells. These results demonstrate the activation of PLA2 enzyme in cellular homogenates during the secretory process.","['Garcia-Gil, M', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Garcia-Gil M', 'Siraganian RP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Aminocaproates)', '0 (Haptens)', '10466-72-5 (6-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)aminohexanoic acid)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aminocaproates/immunology', 'Animals', 'Basophils/*enzymology/immunology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Haptens/immunology', '*Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Rats', 'Substrate Specificity']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jan;136(1):259-63.,,,,,,,,

This distinction between HCSF and IL 3 has been achieved in three different ways: a) biochemical separation of HCSF from IL 3 in crude secondary MLC supernatants with description of different physicochemical characteristics of the two molecules; b) demonstration of an HCSF activity devoid of IL 3 activity in P388D1 conditioned medium, with the same characteristics as HCSF produced during secondary MLC but different from WEHI-3-derived HCSF activity resulting from IL 3; c) demonstration of a lack of inhibition of HCSF-induced histamine synthesis by anti-IL 3 immunoglobulins that clearly diminish IL 3-induced histamine production.

However, the endothelium of glomerular capillaries and of interstitial blood vessels has also reacted with MAb 44G4. The kidney antigen recognized by MAb 44G4 was characterized as a major polypeptide band, 95,000 m.w. (reduced) and 125,000 m.w. (nonreduced), a subunit structure analogous to the 44G4 antigen isolated from leukemic cells. MAb 44E3 reacted with all cellular elements of glomeruli, tubules, blood vessels, and interstitium. Two polypeptide chains of apparent m.w. 94,000 and 90,000 were immunoprecipitated from kidney by MAb 44E3, while a single polypeptide chain of 94,000 m.w. was precipitated from leukemic cells.

I. Functional characterization by monoclonal antibodies.,3944-50,"Three rat monoclonal antibodies (MAb) capable of stimulating interleukin 2 (IL 2) production by a variant subline of EL4 thymoma cells (EL4-6.1) have been produced. The stimulatory capacity of these MAb (designated RL73, RL119, and RL388) was originally found to be dependent on the presence of irradiated peritoneal exudate cells; however, this requirement could be replaced by the cellfree supernatant of the ""macrophage-like"" cell line P388D1 or by biochemically purified human interleukin 1 (IL 1). A number of other rat MAb directed against cell surface structures did not stimulate IL 1-dependent IL 2 production by EL4-6.1 cells; however, certain MAb directed against Thy-1 as well as the lectin phytohemagglutin did have this capacity. Furthermore, the stimulatory activity of MAb RL73, RL119, and RL388 appeared to be restricted to the EL4-6.1 variant line, because neither the parental EL4 line from which it was derived nor a series of ovalbumin-specific T-T hybrids responded to these MAb. The cell surface antigens recognized by MAb RL73, RL119, and RL388 were present on a wide variety of T cell lines and T-T hybrids, as well as on lines of B cell, macrophage, and fibroblast origin. Interestingly, the MAb reacted with the majority (approximately 85%) of thymocytes but not (or only to a very small extent) with resting T lymphocytes. After stimulation by concanavalin A, however, the three MAb reacted strongly with activated T lymphoblasts. The latter data suggest that MAb RL73, RL119, and RL388 may react with cell surface structures that are normally expressed as a consequence of lymphocyte activation.","['MacDonald, H R', 'Lees, R K', 'Bron, C']","['MacDonald HR', 'Lees RK', 'Bron C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*physiology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology/physiology', 'Hybridomas/immunology/metabolism', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymoma/*immunology/metabolism']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Dec;135(6):3944-50.,,,,,,,,

In addition, 1F5 induces a moderate increase in thymidine uptake, which is accompanied by enhanced viability of the cells, but not by any increase in total cell number or by any detectable entry into S phase or mitosis. Taken together, these observations suggest that 1F5 can initiate transition from the G0 to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The fact that all the changes observed can be inhibited by low concentrations (I50 = 50 ng/ml) of cyclosporin A is further evidence that 1F5 is involved at an early stage of B cell activation. Because both 1F5 and B1 belong to the IgG2a subclass, differences in their activities are likely to reflect their different epitope specificities. Although only 1F5 had stimulatory activity, both 1F5 and B1 strongly inhibited B cell differentiation to immunoglobulin secretion.

When immunity to this antigen results in rejection of a syngeneic tumor transplant, it is referred to as a tumor-associated transplantation antigen (TATA). RBL-5 is a Rauscher murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-induced leukemia of C57B1/6 origin that is potently immunogenic and shares a TATA with other tumors induced by the closely related Friend and Moloney-MuLVs (FMR-TATA). We have recently isolated a 175 kilodalton (kd) glycoprotein (gp175) which has all the properties expected of the FMR-TATA (Rogers et al., 1984). When this molecule was separated from a purified total glycoprotein fraction by DEAE chromatography, the remaining glycoproteins still contained a highly immunogenic TATA. Control experiments involving radioimmunoassay and immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-gp175 indicated that this immunogenicity was not due to residual gp175 or breakdown products of gp175. We therefore conclude that RBL-5 expresses at least two distinct TATAs: gp175 and another glycoprotein distinguished from gp175 by its elution from a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DE52) column. These results, from a completely in vivo system, support data with other tumors obtained by in vitro methods and indicate that tumor cells may express several immunogenic molecules.","['Galetto, G', 'Law, L W', 'Rogers, M J']","['Galetto G', 'Law LW', 'Rogers MJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (tumor-associated transplantation antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Transplantation Immunology']",1985/12/15 00:00,1985/12/15 00:01,['1985/12/15 00:00'],"['1985/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910360616 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Dec 15;36(6):713-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910360616.,,,,,,,,

An increase in either the extracellular MTX concentration (0.1-10 microM) or exposure time (4-24 h) allowed a greater accumulation of polyglutamate derivatives. The species which predominated (di-, tri-, or tetraglutamate) was also time and concentration dependent. Derivatives up to the pentaglutamate were readily detectable, with hexaglutamate present under some conditions. Polyglutamate derivatives were preferentially retained when the cells were transferred to drug-free medium. MTX itself rapidly exited the cells under these conditions. In the absence of extracellular MTX, the performed intracellular MTX polyglutamates continued to be elongated. Accumulation of MTX polyglutamates, particularly triglutamate and longer species, positively correlated with cytotoxicity to CCRF-CEM cells as measured by a clonogenic assay. Investigation of the methotrexate-fluorouracil interaction revealed no effect of 5-fluorouracil on MTX polyglutamate accumulation under various conditions where widely different degrees of cytotoxicity were found. The synergy observed when MTX precedes fluorouracil treatment is therefore not an effect on MTX polyglutamylation. MTX polyglutamates may, however, play an indirect role in this synergy.","['McGuire, J J', 'Mini, E', 'Hsieh, P', 'Bertino, J R']","['McGuire JJ', 'Mini E', 'Hsieh P', 'Bertino JR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Peptides)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/toxicity']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Dec;45(12 Pt 1):6395-400.,['CA 08010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Why lymphoma cells are unresponsive to normal regulatory growth controls and how they differ from normal lymphocytes are not well understood. In order to address these questions we have raised monoclonal antibodies to neoplastic B-cells. Two of these, LM-26 and LM-155, show a high degree of specificity for B-cell lymphomas. When tested by fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis, LM-26 reacted with 80% (18 of 23) of B-cell lymphomas freshly explanted from patients and LM-155 reacted with 20% (5 of 23). The antigenic determinant detected by LM-26 was also found to be present on four of seven neoplastic large cell B-lymphoma lines. LM-155 detected a determinant present on all seven of these lines. For neither monoclonal antibody was there any association between antibody reactivity and the morphological subtype of lymphoma examined or the type of cell surface immunoglobulin expressed. LM-155 reacted with one case of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Neither antibody reacted with normal B-cell blasts, normal peripheral blood mononuclear or marrow cells, T-cell leukemias or lymphomas, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Lymphocytes from reactive lymphoid hyperplasias involving lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood, and lung were also negative for LM-26 and LM-155 binding or showed only a small percentage of cells positive (4-8%). Both monoclonals were unreactive with non-B-lymphoid neoplastic cell lines, nine of ten Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-cell lines, and cells freshly explanted from patients with cancers of diverse cellular origins. Fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis of the expression of the antigens defined by LM-26 and LM-155 on lymphoma cells and normal B-cell blasts suggests that they are not normal differentiation antigens associated with lymphocyte activation or proliferation. The highly restricted expression of detectable levels of antigens reactive with monoclonal antibodies LM-26 and LM-155 on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells suggests a possible relation to their neoplastic properties. From a practical viewpoint these monoclonals may prove useful in the diagnosis, classification, detection of residual disease, and treatment of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.","['Howard, D R', 'Eaves, A C', 'Takei, F']","['Howard DR', 'Eaves AC', 'Takei F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Dec;45(12 Pt 1):6322-7.,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate this hypothesis a number of experiments were performed in which the cellular cytotoxicity of DNA reactive agents (ethidium bromide, adriamycin or cis-platinum) were evaluated alone and in combination with bleomycin, a strand-scission agent, using a number of different tumor cell systems in vitro. The results of these studies indicated that combinations of these agents were found to be much more effective than treatment with single drugs alone. This conclusion was warranted for the action of ethidium bromide followed by bleomycin with murine L1210 leukemia, melanoma B16-BL6 and human HeLa cells, and cis-platinum followed by bleomycin with L1210 and B16-BL6 cells. These data support previous findings in which synergistic growth inhibition of L1210 cells by ethidium bromide, followed by bleomycin was explained by a two-step mechanism; first, ethidium bromide introduces changes in DNA-conformation resulting in the facilitation of a second step in which bleomycin cleaves DNA more efficiently.

A patient in ""mixed"" blast crisis of CML was studied. On the basis of morphology, cytochemistry, and immunological studies, the blasts were classified as having either lymphoid or myeloid characteristics. A proportion of the leukemic blasts expressed CALLA, whereas others expressed My7 antigen. In order to characterize both populations of cell further, CALLA+ blasts and My7+ (myeloid) blasts were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The My7+ cells were highly proliferative in cell culture blast colony assays, retained the Ph1 chromosome, and were indistinguishable from acute myelogenous leukemia blasts. The CALLA+ cells were also Ph1-chromosome positive, but in contrast, were poorly proliferative in vitro. Of particular note was their retention of germline configuration of Ig genes, thus distinguishing them from blasts in the lymphoid crisis of CML.

In light of these and previously reported results the complexity and map order of the pol gene are discussed.","['Copeland, T D', 'Gerard, G F', 'Hixson, C W', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Copeland TD', 'Gerard GF', 'Hixson CW', 'Oroszlan S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*isolation & purification']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(85)90411-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1985 Jun;143(2):676-9. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(85)90411-8.,['N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

In comparison with fresh alloimmune spleen cells, MLC-expanded cells had a significantly higher frequency of CTL reactive against leukemia targets in vitro. However, the reactivity of MLC-expanded cells against first-passage spontaneous AKR (H-2k) leukemia in vivo was significantly less than when an equivalent number of fresh alloimmune spleen cells was injected. Comparable antileukemia reactivity was observed in vivo only when the inoculum of MLC-expanded cells was 2-3-fold higher than that of fresh spleen cells. This relative ineffectiveness was attributed to the altered migration pattern of cultured cells in vivo. IL-2-dependent cloned CTL, specific for a normal lymphocyte antigen (Qa-1b) also present on leukemia cells, were derived from MLC-expanded cultures and tested in vivo. For cloned CTL, as with MLC-expanded cells, eradication of AKR leukemia in vivo was associated with the tissue distribution pattern of the injected effector cells. That is, an effective antileukemia reaction was achieved only in tissues in which effector and target proximity was maintained. Qa-1b-specific cloned CTL did not interfere with engraftment of autologous or allogeneic bone marrow in lethally irradiated host mice, nor did they cause any clinically evident graft-versus-host disease. These findings suggest that cloned CTL specific for a normal cell surface antigen with limited host tissue distribution, but present on tumor cells, could be used for adoptive immunotherapy, provided CTL and tumor cell proximity can be attained.","['LeFever, A V', 'Truitt, R L', 'Shih, C C']","['LeFever AV', 'Truitt RL', 'Shih CC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Epitopes', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Isoantibodies/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-198511000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1985 Nov;40(5):531-7. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198511000-00012.,['CA-39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Fractionation of whole-cell, S-100 protein and nuclear extracts reveals the existence of both general class II and gene-specific transcription initiation factors. Because the soluble in vitro transcription systems prepared from cells in culture are largely nonspecific for the origin of the template DNA, they are highly suited to searching for tissue-specific and gene-specific transcription regulatory factors. In the experiments reported here, we have added a nuclear extract prepared from human erythroleukaemia-like cells (K562, which can be induced to synthesize epsilon- and gamma-globin mRNA and protein) to several deproteinized DNA templates, and monitored transcription levels in a HeLa cell-free transcription system. The K562 nuclear extract enhanced transcription of beta-, epsilon- and gamma-globin genes by as much as 30-fold compared with control non-globin templates.

The unresponsiveness of LM to LPS was seen in all of the mouse strains tested. Treatment of LM with indomethacin did not affect the unresponsiveness, although it greatly augmented the cytotoxicity of PRM stimulated with LPS. LM treated in vitro with crude lymphokines (LK) did not show cytotoxicity, but became sensitive to LPS and cytotoxic for tumor cells. LM treated first with crude LK and then with LPS were cytotoxic, but LM treated first with LPS and then with crude LK were not. The ability of crude LK to render LM responsive to LPS was neutralized by rabbit anti-mouse gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) antiserum but not by anti-mouse IFN-(alpha + beta) antiserum. LM treated with recombinant murine IFN-gamma became responsive to LPS and showed cytotoxicity. LM were resistant to direct toxicity of LPS under conditions in which significant populations of PRM and PEM died. However, LM became sensitive to direct toxicity of LPS by treatment with crude LK or recombinant murine IFN-gamma. Fluorescence microscopy showed that almost all PRM and PEM were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-LPS, while less than 5% of the LM were stained. Instead, approximately 60% of the LM treated with the crude LK or recombinant IFN-gamma for 20 h were stained with FITC-LPS. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis confirmed this result. The staining of IFN-gamma treated LM with FITC-LPS was inhibited by polymyxin B or unlabeled LPS. These results suggest that the defective responsiveness of LM to LPS is due to the lack or very low expression of LPS-binding sites on the cell surface and that in vitro treatment with IFN-gamma brings about the expression of them and renders LM responsive to LPS.","['Akagawa, K S', 'Tokunaga, T']","['Akagawa KS', 'Tokunaga T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.162.5.1444 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Nov 1;162(5):1444-59. doi: 10.1084/jem.162.5.1444.,,PMC2187932,,,,,,

However, the frequency of particular conventional Ia allodeterminants, including DRw53, is not significantly elevated in the leukemia group. Considerable evidence supports the conclusion that the high frequency of the 109d6 epitope reflects an inherited basis for susceptibility to the development of acute myelogenous leukemia and not a differentiation event occurring in the leukemic lineage. The 109d6 determinant is expressed by leukemic myeloblasts as well as by homologous normal B cells and monocytes obtained from the same individuals during remission of the leukemia.

In 50-60 per cent of those patients affected with acute myeloic leukemia a deviating karyotype could be detected. With a markedly higher frequency chromosomes 8 and 21 will take part in aberrations, with translocations (8; 21) having the main share with about 30-40 per cent. More than half the male bearers of translocation exhibits a loss of the Y-chromosome, a third of female patients a loss of the X-chromosome. Trisomy 8 and 9 as well as monosomy 7 appear in about 20 per cent. These aberrations can also be found in all other leukemic and preleukemic processes. Patients with karyotypic abnormalities in all their cells will have the slightest average survival time and the worst appeal to therapy. The sole appearance of monosomy 7 or Ph1-chromosome respectively seems to be an unfavourable sign from a prognostic point of view. Children with acute myeloic leukemia will possess an aberrant karyotype more frequently than adults, but they have a longer average life, boys are more frequently affected by this. Acute promyelocytic leukemia can be characterized cytogenetically in 94 per cent of the cases by translocation (15; 17). However, distinct geographical differences can be observed here, the causes of which have not been elucidated. About 40 per cent of the patients with acute myelo-monocytic leukemia developed aberrations. Further investigations will have to show whether the chromosome 11 really took part in it somewhat more frequently than merely at random. Chromosome anomalies have not a visible influence on the course of the disease. In 30-40 per cent of patients with a rarely occurring acute monocytic leukemia, an abnormal karyotype could be found. There was an incidence of 47 per cent for a specific translocation (9; 11) or a similar variant respectively. Erythroleukemia is characterized by a high instability of chromosomes and karyotypical variability, particularly in erythrocyte precursors and by an average survival time of one months. Megakaryoblastic and eosinophilic leukemia are very rare kinds of acute leukemias.

As compared with those of normal counterparts, CML extracts catalyzed a 50% higher overall rate of sialylation of asialofetuin, a substrate possessing both N- and O-linked acceptors. Studies of enzyme specificity utilizing porcine and ovine submaxillary mucins, antifreeze glycoprotein and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein as acceptors showed that the increased sialylation by CML extracts was due primarily to substrates with the O-linked Gal beta 1----3GaINAc acceptor group. These data suggest that sialyltransferase activity is increased in CML granulocytes compared to normal granulocytes and that the increased enzyme activity is specific for O-linked Gal beta 1----3GaINAc. This enzyme activity may be directly responsible for the abnormal membrane sialylation and pathophysiological behavior of these cells.","['Baker, M A', 'Taub, R N', 'Kanani, A', 'Brockhausen, I', 'Hindenburg, A']","['Baker MA', 'Taub RN', 'Kanani A', 'Brockhausen I', 'Hindenburg A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Asialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Fetuins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '0 (asialofetuin)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)']",IM,"['*Asialoglycoproteins', 'Fetuins', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Transferases/*metabolism', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/metabolism']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79947-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Nov;66(5):1068-71.,"['CA 31761-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37162-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Carcinoma cells were detected using antibodies against epithelial cytokeratins, milk fat globule membrane antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen, and rhabdomyosarcoma cells with monoclonal anti-desmin. In four of the carcinoma cases it had not been possible to identify malignant cells in routinely stained marrow smears, whilst the case of disseminated rhabdomyosarcoma had initially been diagnosed (and treated) as a case of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The anti-cytokeratin antibody was found to be the most valuable of the anti-epithelial reagents used, since it labelled malignant cells in all of the 10 cases of carcinoma and gave the strongest reactions. These results suggest that immunocytochemical labelling should be used in cases of suspected carcinoma whenever conventional examination of marrow smears yields negative results, and furthermore (as illustrated by the case of rhabdomyosarcoma) that the technique is of value for identifying the true nature of poorly differentiated neoplasms in bone marrow.","['Ghosh, A K', 'Erber, W N', 'Hatton, C S', ""O'Connor, N T"", 'Falini, B', 'Osborn, M', 'Mason, D Y']","['Ghosh AK', 'Erber WN', 'Hatton CS', ""O'Connor NT"", 'Falini B', 'Osborn M', 'Mason DY']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Keratins/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucin-1', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*diagnosis', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/secondary']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb04056.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 Sep;61(1):21-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb04056.x.,,,,,,,,

The biochemical effects of these agents were studied in L1210 leukemia in relation to other clinically used intercalators. After a 1-hr exposure, CI-937 and CI-942 reduced the cloning efficiency of L1210 cells by 50% at 3.0 X 10(-8) and 1.5 X 10(-7) M respectively. Based on an ethidium displacement assay, these drugs bound strongly to DNA, reducing the fluorescence of an ethidium-DNA complex by 50% at concentrations of 23 and 33 nM for CI-937 and CI-942 respectively. This was comparable to mitoxantrone at 15 nM, but much more potent than Amsacrine which required over 1.3 microM. A distinct property of the anthrapyrazoles was a much more potent inhibitory effect on whole cell DNA synthesis than on RNA synthesis. After L1210 cells were exposed to drug for 2 hr the concentration needed to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50% was 0.33 and 0.57 microM for CI-937 and CI-942, respectively, whereas 2.0 and 11.3 microM were required to inhibit RNA synthesis by the same extent. This was in contrast to Adriamycin and mitoxantrone which inhibited both activities equally at similar concentrations. It was apparent that the inhibition of these processes was not due to substrate depletion since intracellular ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates either remained constant or were elevated after a 2-hr exposure to 1 or 10 microM drug. A similar discriminatory effect was observed on DNA and RNA polymerase in permeabilized cells, and the inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis in this system could be reversed by exogenously added DNA. Since the high incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with the administration of anthracyclines has been related to the formation of reactive oxygen species, the ability of the anthrapyrazoles to augment superoxide dismutase sensitive oxygen consumption was observed in a rat liver microsomal system. CI-937 and CI-942 induced 5- and 10-fold less oxygen consumption than Adriamycin, producing rates of 12.4, 24.2 and 138.9 nmoles/min/mg microsomal protein, respectively, at a drug concentration of 0.5 mM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Fry, D W', 'Boritzki, T J', 'Besserer, J A', 'Jackson, R C']","['Fry DW', 'Boritzki TJ', 'Besserer JA', 'Jackson RC']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '96521WL61B (teloxantrone)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'YL4TY9WH22 (piroxantrone)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/therapeutic use', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Anthraquinones/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone', 'Nucleic Acids/*biosynthesis', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pyrazoles/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'RNA/biosynthesis']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(85)90724-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(85)90724-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1985 Oct 1;34(19):3499-508. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(85)90724-5.,,,,,,,,

The concentration of P-Tyr-containing proteins in intercellular junctions in normal cells suggests that these are sites of significant biochemical regulatory activities which may be important in the control of normal cell adhesivity, motility, and shape.","['Maher, P A', 'Pasquale, E B', 'Wang, J Y', 'Singer, S J']","['Maher PA', 'Pasquale EB', 'Wang JY', 'Singer SJ']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*analysis', 'Actins/analysis', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Cytoskeleton/*analysis', 'Dogs', 'Epithelium/analysis/ultrastructure', 'Fibroblasts/analysis/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Intercellular Junctions/*analysis', 'Macropodidae', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.19.6576 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Oct;82(19):6576-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.19.6576.,"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38006-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-15971/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC391252,,,,,,

Complementary DNA clones encoding interleukin-3 (IL-3) have recently been isolated and the structure of the IL-3 gene determined. IL-3 is produced by T lymphocytes or T lymphomas only after stimulation with antigens, mitogens or chemical activators such as phorbol esters. The myelomonocytic leukaemia line WEHI-3B also produces IL-3 but its production is constitutive and the WEHI-3B cells do not appear to produce significant levels of any of the other lymphokines normally secreted by T lymphocytes after stimulation. It has been proposed that the genetic change leading to the constitutive expression of IL-3 may have been a key event in the development of this leukaemia. We report here that the constitutive synthesis of IL-3 by the WEHI-3B cell line is due to the insertion of an endogenous retrovirus-like element close to the 5' end of the gene. The insertion, an intracisternal A particle (IAP) genome, is positioned with its 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) close to the promoter region of the IL-3 gene, resulting in constitutive synthesis of IL-3.","['Ymer, S', 'Tucker, W Q', 'Sanderson, C J', 'Hapel, A J', 'Campbell, H D', 'Young, I G']","['Ymer S', 'Tucker WQ', 'Sanderson CJ', 'Hapel AJ', 'Campbell HD', 'Young IG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA Transposable Elements', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Histamine Release', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1985/09/19 00:00,1985/09/19 00:01,['1985/09/19 00:00'],"['1985/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/317255a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Sep 19-25;317(6034):255-8. doi: 10.1038/317255a0.,,,,['GENBANK/X02923'],,,,

The RS cell appears to be a lymphoblast arising from activated helper T cells. In lymphomatoid papulosis, a cutaneous eruption with histological features of Hodgkin's disease, there is a spectrum of activated helper T cells, including cerebriform cells and large transformed RS-like cells. Clonal expansion of cerebriform cells in lymphomatoid papulosis leads to mycosis fungoides. Similar expansion of large transformed cells results in Hodgkin's disease. Progressive transformation of T4-positive cerebriform cells to Ki-1-positive RS cells accounts for rare cases of coexistent mycosis fungoides and Hodgkin's disease. Confirmation of this hypothesis should focus attention on the family of human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma viruses as possible aetiological agents in these helper-T-cell disorders.","['Kadin, M E']",['Kadin ME'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Epitopes', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mycosis Fungoides/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology/*pathology']",1985/10/19 00:00,1985/10/19 00:01,['1985/10/19 00:00'],"['1985/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(85)90128-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(85)90128-x [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1985 Oct 19;2(8460):864-5. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(85)90128-x.,,,,,,,,

Similar assays showed that pAM6 RNA could not be detected in the peripheral blood leukocytes of normal individuals, or of ALL and CLL patients, but that the relative abundance of pAM6 RNA varied widely in leukocytes from CGL chronic phase, CGL acute phase, and ANLL. No correlation between pAM6 RNA occurrence and FAB classification of ANLL could be made; thus it would appear that the relative abundance of pAM6 RNA in ANLL leukocytes can be used to subdivide the ANLLs in a novel manner.

Not only do the concentrations and specificity of hormones for cell lysis and receptor occupancy correspond, but also steroid resistant cells selected with or without prior mutagenesis often have altered receptors. The glucocorticoid receptor protein from humans and other species is a approximately 95,000 d, thiol group-containing monomer, prone to aggregation when ""unactivated."" After having bound steroid and been ""activated,"" the monomeric steroid-receptor complex is altered in charge and shape so that its binding to chromatin and DNA is greatly enhanced.

These correlations are strongest for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for non Hodgkins' lymphoma. In other diseases, notably acute myelogenous leukemia, such correlations have not been found. The CEM human ALL line has been used in vitro to study mechanisms of glucocorticoid action and resistance. The requirement for ""activated"" steroid-receptor complex for cell lysis is shown in these cells by the spontaneous occurrence of steroid resistant, activation-labile receptor mutants. A second category of resistant cells with normal receptors has been defined. Treatment of these ""lysis defective"" resistant cells with compounds which result in DNA demethylation can render them steroid sensitive. Since DNA demethylation can allow formerly silent genes to become transcribed, it is possible that one or more genes specific for lysis has been ""opened"" in such cells. Alternatively, DNA demethylation may produce a general biochemical effect on the cell which renders it susceptible to lysis. Mutagenized CEM cells selected for steroid resistance give rise to a third class of mutants, which are deficient in receptor quantity.

The human prothymocyte has not been identified as yet. We analyzed human BM cells by double immunofluorescence staining for TdT and the T cell surface markers Tp41 (recognized by the monoclonal antibodies WT1 and 3A1), T11, T1, and T6. In the BM samples tested, neither T1+/TdT+ nor T6+/TdT+ cells were detected, but Tp41+/TdT+ and T11+/TdT+ cells were present in low frequencies. In childhood BM, the frequency was about two to five in 10,000, whereas in adult BM and regenerating BM, these cells were not always detectable, but if detected, their frequency was five- to 10-fold lower.

Short-term cultures of the buffy coat, which lacked endothelial cells, were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and von Willebrand protein was immunopurified from cell lysates and culture medium. Cultures from this patient synthesized and secreted von Willebrand protein, in contrast with cultures from other patients with leukemia, who lacked circulating megakaryocytes, and from normal volunteers. The subunit composition of the megakaryocytic von Willebrand protein was very similar to that of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The size of the processed subunit (220 kD) and of the cellular (260 kD) and secreted (275 kD) precursors from the two cell types were indistinguishable by gel electrophoresis.

Desferrioxamine (DFOA) enhanced TfR expression when added in the dose range of 10(-5)-10(-4) to CCRF-CEM cells, but was toxic to these cells, the lower concentrations producing a slowing of cell growth with a build up in S-phase, while higher concentrations caused cell death with a block at the G1/S-phase interface. These toxic effects are compatible with its previously reported inhibition of the non-haem iron containing (M2) subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. In marked contrast, DFOA caused the growth of B16 melanoma cells to arrest in G1, without loss of cloning efficiency, and resulted in a fall in TfR expression to approximately 50% of control values. These results suggested that the effects of DFOA on TfR expression were linked to DNA synthesis rather than to a more generalised inhibition of iron-dependent cellular processes. It was subsequently found that inhibition of the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase in CCRF-CEM cells with 5 X 10(-5) M hydroxyurea, which is not an iron chelator, also enhanced TfR expression, as did thymidine and cytosine arabinoside, which have different enzyme targets. By measuring cellular DNA and RNA content simultaneously it was shown that all of these agents caused unbalanced growth, i.e., inhibited DNA synthesis more than RNA synthesis. In contrast, 6-thioguanine was more inhibitory to RNA synthesis, and treatment with this drug caused a fall in TfR expression. Thus, although CCRF-CEM cells treated with DFOA show enhanced TfR expression, similar effects are also seen with other inhibitors of DNA synthesis, provided that RNA synthesis is allowed to continue. These results provide further evidence that the regulation of TfR expression by proliferating cells is specifically linked to DNA synthesis rather than to the iron requirements of other cellular processes.","['Hedley, D', 'Rugg, C', 'Musgrove, E', 'Taylor, I']","['Hedley D', 'Rugg C', 'Musgrove E', 'Taylor I']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Interphase', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Melanoma/genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transferrin']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041240111 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1985 Jul;124(1):61-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041240111.,,,,,,,,

The carcinomas contain keratin; identification of individual keratin components may allow further sub-classification of carcinomas which is consistent with their tissue of origin. The sarcomas of muscle origin contain desmin. Vimentin is found primarily with cells of mesenchymal origin, but may coexist with other intermediate filament proteins in other tumors. One example is the coexistence of keratin and vimentin in tumors, such as mesotheliomas, which are derived from epithelial cells of embryonic origin. Glial fibrillary acidic protein is the most specific marker for glial tumors. Tumors of neural origin are characterized by the presence of neurofilament subunits. Therefore, analysis of CSK composition would be useful in diagnosis of clinical specimens and aid in studies of lineage relationships of neoplasms. Although no consistent differences in cytoskeletal structure between neoplastic and normal cells have been identified so far, the presence of more subtle biochemical alterations in the cytoskeletal structure of neoplastic cells that contributes to malignant behavior has not been ruled out. Since the cytoskeletal network plays an important role in cell shape and cell locomotion, which in turn are thought to be involved in growth control, invasion, and metastasis, further work is directed at identifying the various alterations in cytoskeletal architecture that may influence the malignant behavior of neoplastic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Bernal, S D', 'Stahel, R A']","['Bernal SD', 'Stahel RA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Desmin)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/pathology', 'Actins/physiology', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Carcinoma/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*physiology', 'Cytoskeleton/pathology', 'Desmin/physiology', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/physiology', 'Glioma/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Keratins/physiology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Microtubules/pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Nerve Tissue/metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Sarcoma/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Vimentin/physiology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(85)80026-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(85)80026-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1985;3(3):191-204. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(85)80026-3.,,,,,,101,,

Depending on the target cell, interferon exerts either an inhibitory or an inductive effect on cell differentiation. In certain myeloid leukemic cells, such as HL-60, interferon by itself is growth suppressive but does not induce cell maturation, whereas in combination with inducers of differentiation, such as DMSO, TPA or retinoic acid, interferon potentiates their ability to stimulate differentiation in both sensitive and resistant cell populations (Grant et al., 1982, 1983; Tomida et al., 1982). Interferon also interacts synergistically with phorbol ester tumor promoters in inhibiting melanogenesis in murine B-16 cells (Fisher et al., 1981a, 1984a) and adipocyte formation in 3T3 cells (Cioe et al., 1980), whereas the combination is synergistic in inducing differentiation in human melanoma cells (Fisher et al., 1984b,c). In contrast, interferon and TPA display antagonistic effects on differentiation in human skeletal muscle cultures, i.e. interferon induces and TPA inhibits myogenesis (Fisher et al., 1982, 1983). Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of high affinity saturable cell membrane receptors for mouse and human interferons (Aguet, 1980; Branca and Baglioni, 1981, 1982; Mogensen et al., 1981; Branca et al., 1982; Anderson et al., 1982; Joshi et al., 1982; Faltynek et al., 1983; Yonehara et al., 1983; Langer and Pestka, in preparation). Similarly, specific membrane receptors have been identified for phorbol esters and mezerein (Driedger and Blumberg, 1980; Shoyab and Todaro, 1980; Horowitz et al., 1981; Fisher et al., 1981b). These findings suggest that the plasma membrane may be a primary target for mediating the biochemical effects induced by both interferon and phorbol esters. Although the mechanism by which interferon and phorbol esters transmit the necessary membrane signal(s) required for altering differentiation are not known, a possible component of this transmembrane signaling process may involve changes in the physical dynamics of the plasma membrane. It is therefore of interest that both interferon and TPA induce early changes in the fluidity of the plasma membrane (Fisher et al., 1979, 1981b, 1984d; Castagna et al., 1979; Kuhry et al., 1983).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Fisher, P B', 'Grant, S']","['Fisher PB', 'Grant S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,"['0 (Melanins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Melanins/biosynthesis', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Muscles/cytology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0163-7258(85)90067-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0163-7258(85)90067-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 1985;27(2):143-66. doi: 10.1016/0163-7258(85)90067-1.,,,,,,116,,

Fibroblasts infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) exhibited up to a 10-fold increase in cell surface expression of all three class I MHC antigens. Increases in MHC expression resulted in the increased susceptibility of M-MuLV-infected cells to lysis by allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). M-MuLV appears to exert its effect at the genomic level, because mRNA specific for class I antigens, as well as beta 2-microglobulin, show a fourfold increase. Fibroblasts infected with the Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV):M-MuLV complex show no increase in MHC antigen expression or class I mRNA synthesis, suggesting that co-infection with MSV inhibits M-MuLV enhancement of MHC gene expression. Quantitative differences in class I antigen expression on virus-infected cells were also found to influence the susceptibility of infected cells to lysis by H-2-restricted, virus-specific CTL. Differential lysis of infected cells expressing varied levels of class I antigens by M-MuLV-specific bulk CTL populations and CTL clones suggests that individual clones may have different quantitative requirements for class I antigen expression. The MSV inhibition of MHC expression could be reversed by interferon-gamma. Treatment of MSV:M-MuLV-infected fibroblasts with interferon-gamma increased their susceptibility to lysis by both allogeneic and syngeneic CTL.

Between 0.3 and 0.8 mg of purified proteoglycan was obtained from approximately 1 g initial dry weight of cells with a purification of 200-800-fold. The purified proteoglycans had a hydrodynamic size range of Mr 100,000-150,000 and were resistant to degradation by a molar excess of trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, Pronase, papain, chymopapain, collagenase, and elastase. Amino acid analysis of the peptide core revealed a preponderance of Gly (35.4%), Ser (22.5%), and Ala (9.5%). Approximately 70% of the glycosaminoglycan side chains of RBL-1 proteoglycans were digested by chondroitinase ABC and 27% were hydrolyzed by treatment with nitrous acid. Sephadex G-200 chromatography of glycosaminoglycans liberated from the intact molecule by beta-elimination demonstrated that both the nitrous acid-resistant (chondroitin sulfate) and the chondroitinase ABC-resistant (heparin/heparan sulfate) glycosaminoglycans were of approximately Mr 12,000. Analysis of the chondroitin sulfate disaccharides in different preparations by amino-cyano high performance liquid chromatography revealed that 9-29% were the unusual disulfated disaccharide chondroitin sulfate di-B (IdUA-2-SO4----GalNAc-4-SO4); the remainder were the monosulfated disaccharide GlcUA----GalNAc-4-SO4. Subpopulations of proteoglycans in one preparation were separated by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography and were found to contain chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans whose disulfated disaccharides ranged from 9-49%. However, no segregation of subpopulations without both chondroitin sulfate di-B and heparin/heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans was achieved, suggesting that RBL-1 proteoglycans might be hybrids containing both classes of glycosaminoglycans. Sepharose CL-6B chromatography of RBL-1 proteoglycans digested with chondroitinase ABC revealed that less than 7% of the molecules in the digest chromatographed with the hydrodynamic size of undigested proteoglycans, suggesting that at most 7% of the proteoglycans lack chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Seldin, D C', 'Austen, K F', 'Stevens, R L']","['Seldin DC', 'Austen KF', 'Stevens RL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9007-27-6 (Chondroitin)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Basophils/immunology/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chondroitin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/*analysis', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*analysis', 'Endopeptidases', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*analysis', '*Heparin', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'Proteoglycans/*isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes']",1985/09/15 00:00,1985/09/15 00:01,['1985/09/15 00:00'],"['1985/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)39157-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Sep 15;260(20):11131-9.,"['AI-07167/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-22531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-35984/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

This study compared in parallel the effects of pharmacological agents on 45Ca2+ influx, phospholipase activation as measured by the release of [14C]-arachidonic acid, and histamine release. Microtubule-depolymerizing agents (demecolcine, colchicine, and vinblastine sulfate) did not affect 45Ca2+ influx, but blocked the IgE- or A23187-mediated [14C]-arachidonic acid and histamine release (e.g., IC50 for vinblastine sulfate = 10 nM). In contrast, a microtubule-stabilizing agent (taxol) blocked the IgE- and A23187-mediated 45Ca2+ influx and [14C]-arachidonic acid and histamine release (IC50 = 20 microM). Microfilament-disrupting agents (cytochalasin B, C, D, and E) enhanced 45Ca2+ influx and [14C]-arachidonic acid and histamine release in the same dose-dependent fashion (e.g., EC50 for cytochalasin B = 0.4 microM). Other pharmacological agents such as a metabolic inhibitor (antimycin A), calmodulin inhibitors (W-7, trifluoperazine, and chlorpromazine), and protease inhibitors (TPCK and TLCK) blocked the IgE- and A23187-mediated 45Ca2+ influx and [14C]-arachidonic acid and histamine release. Therefore, the coupling of Ca2+ influx and the phospholipase activation step requires a functioning microtubule system.

At least an additive differentiation-inducing effect was found between IFN-gamma and 1-100 nM retinoic acid (RA). A marked synergistic differentiation-inducing effect was found between IFN-gamma and 0.1-1.0 nM 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25[OH]2D3). It is also shown that U-937 can be primed for differentiation by treatment for approximately one day with 1,25(OH)2D3 followed by exposure to IFN-gamma. Priming of these cells does not depend on the normal rate of RNA synthesis, as it occurs even better in the presence of cordycepin, suggesting that a decrease in RNA synthesis favors IFN-induced differentiation. Actually, the addition of cordycepin during initial incubation with IFN increased the subsequent response to IFN-gamma (and also to RA and 1,25[OH]2D3). These results, indicating that combinations of IFN-gamma and either RA or 1,25(OH)2D3 induce differentiation of U-937, may be of importance in combination biotherapy of leukemia.","['Gullberg, U', 'Nilsson, E', 'Einhorn, S', 'Olsson, I']","['Gullberg U', 'Nilsson E', 'Einhorn S', 'Olsson I']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1985 Aug;13(7):675-9.,,,,,,,,

Such sites contain actin and vinculin and represent close contacts with the substratum as revealed by interference reflection microscopy. Only a few adhesion plaques and actin filament bundles can be detected in these cells as compared to untransformed parental fibroblasts. In thin sections examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) these adhesion sites correspond to short protrusions of the ventral cell surface that contact the substratum at their apical portion. These structures, which may represent cellular feet, are therefore called podosomes. By screening a number of different transformed fibroblasts plated on a fibronectin-coated substratum we find that podosomes are common to mammalian and avian cell lines transformed either by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) or by Fujinami avian sarcoma virus (FSV), whose oncogenes encode specific tyrosine kinases. Using antibodies reacting with phosphotyrosine in immunofluorescence experiments, we show that phosphotyrosine-containing molecules are concentrated in podosomes. Podosomes are not detected in fibroblasts transformed by other retroviruses (Snyder-Theilen sarcoma virus, Abelson leukemia virus and Kirsten sarcoma virus) or by DNA tumor viruses (polyoma, SV40), indicating that podosome-mediated adhesion in transformed fibroblasts is related to the peculiar properties of some oncoproteins and possibly to their tropism for adhesion systems. Podosomes and adhesion plaques, although similar in cytoskeletal protein composition, have different mechanisms and kinetics of formation. Assembly of podosomes, in fact (i) does not require fetal calf serum (FCS) in the adhesion medium, that is necessary for the organization of adhesion plaques; (ii) does not require protein synthesis; and (iii) is insensitive to the ionophore monensin, that prevents adhesion plaque formation. Moreover, during attachment to fibronectin-coated dishes, podosomes appear in the initial phase (60 min) of attachment, while adhesion plaques require a minimum of 180 min. In conclusion podosomes of RSV- and FSV-transformed fibroblasts represent a phenotypic variant of adhesion structures.","['Tarone, G', 'Cirillo, D', 'Giancotti, F G', 'Comoglio, P M', 'Marchisio, P C']","['Tarone G', 'Cirillo D', 'Giancotti FG', 'Comoglio PM', 'Marchisio PC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '125361-02-6 (Vinculin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Animals', '*Avian Sarcoma Viruses', '*Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/analysis', 'Fibroblasts', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Muscle Proteins/analysis', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Vinculin']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(85)80044-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4827(85)80044-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1985 Jul;159(1):141-57. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4827(85)80044-6.,,,,,,,,

Two cell lines resistant to MP (WilsonR and CCRF-CEMR) were also studied. The cell lines were incubated for 3 h in 10 microM [14C]MP and then placed in drug-free media for an additional 3 h. Cell samples were obtained at regular intervals, and the intracellular MP metabolites were measured in the acid-soluble fractions by anion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography. MP accumulated progressively within cells during the 3-h drug exposure period and declined rapidly when the cells were placed in drug-free media. Over 80% of the intracellular MP was present in the form of three nucleotide metabolites, MP ribose monophosphate, thioxanthosine monophosphate, and thioguanosine monophosphate. MP ribose monophosphate was found in greatest amount, accounting for 59-85% of the intracellular metabolite pool. Thioxanthosine monophosphate thioguanosine monophosphate were detected in lesser amounts. Study of leukemic cells obtained from patients demonstrated a similar pattern of MP accumulation, metabolism, and retention, although the overall amounts of the various metabolites formed were less. In contrast, there was essentially no MP nucleotide metabolite formation in the two MP-resistant cell lines.

The protective effect of poly(I) X poly(C) was also evident in non-tumor-bearing mice, as well as following administration of drug intraperitoneally to mice bearing the tumor implanted intraperitoneally.

The unagglutinated cell fraction, previously shown to be highly enriched for the hematopoietic pluripotential stem cells and capable of reconstituting lethally irradiated adult patients with acute leukemia, was further fractionated by affinity chromatography on the lectin conjugated to Sepharose 6MB beads. Two independent assays, one using radiolabeling of the tumor cells and the other based on cloning of the neuroblastoma cells on agar, showed that the agglutination step alone removes 64-76% of the radiolabeled neuroblastoma cells and 85-98% of the clonogenic cells from the tumor/bone marrow cell mixture. Passage of the unagglutinated radiolabeled cells through SBA-Sepharose columns results in further purging of 28-53% of the neuroblastoma cells. Thus a combination of the two methods affords only one-log depletion for the neuroblastoma cells, compared to a three-log depletion achieved for a T-cell leukemia line CEM tested in parallel. It seems therefore that the agglutination technique, or the use of SBA-Sepharose columns, can be used only as a preliminary step for the purging of neuroblastoma cells from involved human bone marrow preparations. Staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated SBA of nine different neuroblastoma cell lines, including the four tested in the fractionation studies, showed that more than 98% of the cells, of all the cell lines tested, specifically bind to the lectin, whereas no specific binding can be detected on the stem cell-enriched bone marrow cell fraction. However, the total number of receptors on the neuroblastoma cells is small compared to that of line CEM or normal granulocytes, which are strongly agglutinated by SBA. It seems therefore that the quantitative difference in the total number of SBA receptors is a crucial factor for purging by the agglutination technique or by affinity chromatography. Although these results show limitations to the use of both methods, this study establishes that all neuroblastoma cell lines tested express receptors for the lectin. Improved purging of neuroblastoma cells may possibly be achieved by targeting SBA-bound toxins or magnetic spheres to these receptors.","['Reisner, Y', 'Gan, J']","['Reisner Y', 'Gan J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '0 (soybean lectin)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Agglutination', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Agarose', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluoresceins', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/*metabolism', '*Plant Lectins', '*Soybean Proteins', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Thiocyanates', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Sep;45(9):4026-31.,,,,,,,,

Kinetics of uptake and inhibition of histamine synthesis in basophil (2H3) cell cultures.,191-9,"Labeled histidine was taken up into rat leukemic basophil 2H3 cells by a system with high affinity for histidine and then decarboxylated to form histamine. Uptake was partially inhibited and decarboxylation was completely blocked by alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (alpha-FMH) at concentrations of 10-100 microM. alpha-FMH appeared to be co-transported by a histidine uptake system but the affinity of the system for alpha-FMH was lower than that for histidine (Km 130 and 24 microM, respectively). The drug rapidly penetrated into and became highly localized within the cells. By 60 min the apparent IC50 for inhibition of histamine synthesis in intact cell suspensions was 0.2 microM compared to an IC50 of 1-2 microM alpha-FMH for inhibition of soluble histidine decarboxylase preparations. Turnover of histidine decarboxylase activity in 2H3 cells was rapid (t1/2, 37 min), and biphasic effects were noted after 24-h exposure of 2H3 cells to drug. At low concentrations (greater than 0.1 microM), decarboxylase activity was increased (up to 134 +/- 9% of control values). Higher concentrations of the drug (0.1-10 microM) were inhibitory, and inhibition was related to drug concentration. No detectable decarboxylase activity was observed with 10 microM alpha-FMH after 4 days. Histamine levels increased (up to 232 +/- 2% of control values) or decreased in parallel with decarboxylase activity. Even in cultures devoid of histamine or decarboxylase activity (with 10 microM alpha-FMH) cell division and growth were not affected. Thus the drug appeared to inhibit specifically histamine synthesis without impairing essential cellular metabolic processes. However, kinetics of drug uptake and perturbation of enzyme turnover are additional factors to be considered in the action of alpha-FMH in intact cell systems.","['WoldeMussie, E', 'Beaven, M A']","['WoldeMussie E', 'Beaven MA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Methylhistidines)', '156-86-5 (Homoarginine)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '70050-43-0 (alpha-fluoromethylhistidine)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 4.1.1.22 (Histidine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Histamine/*biosynthesis', 'Histidine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Histidine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Homoarginine/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Methylhistidines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Sodium/physiology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1985 Aug;28(2):191-9.,,,,,,,,

The cell line, which has been maintained in culture for over 10 months, has a modal number of 46 chromosomes and is characterized by a chromosomal abnormality, present in most of the cells, consisting of a translocation between chromosome X and chromosome 15 (46X,Xq-,15p+). The cells are not recognized by the OKT3 and OKT11 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), nor do they form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes. By contrast, they react with the OKT6, Leu-1, and Leu-9 MoAb, which detect early T-lymphocytes, and express the more mature OKT8 antigen. The presence of the OKT8 marker is associated with suppressor activity on the pokeweed mitogen-induced proliferation and differentiation of normal B-cells, both by the PF-382 cells and by their supernatant. However, no cytotoxic activity against natural killer (NK)-sensitive target cells (K562) was found, indicating that the proliferating cells do not correspond to the subset of NK cells expressing the OKT8 antigen. Furthermore, the cells are incapable of both spontaneous and mitogen-induced interleukin-2 and interferon production.

Electrophoretic analysis of the material reacting with WT-31 revealed that it precipitated predominantly an 80-kD disulfide-linked heterodimer from the cell surface-labeled T leukemic cell line HPB-ALL. This heterodimer was identical to the one precipitated with a recently described monoclonal reagent, T40/25, which recognizes a clonotypic structure on HPB-ALL. The target antigen of WT-31 comodulated with T3 after incubation of T cells with excess anti-T3 antibody, indicating that the WT-31 target antigen is associated with T3. We also found that anti-T3 reagents, but not the clonotypic reagent T40/25, blocked binding of FITC-labeled WT-31 to HPB-ALL cells. This indicates that the T cell receptor epitope recognized by WT-31 is located close to the epitopes recognized by the anti-T3 reagents anti-Leu-4 and SPV-T3b but distal from the clonotypic T40/25 epitope. Functional studies showed that WT-31 reacts similar to anti-T3 antibodies. It is mitogenic for resting T cells, blocks cytolysis mediated by alloantigen-specific CTL clones, and induces antigen-nonspecific cytolysis by CTL clones against Daudi target cells. WT-31 did not inhibit the formation of conjugates, but it blocked cytolysis just before or during the Ca2++-dependent programming for lysis.

In the majority of cases (17), the Leu-4 antigen was absent from the cell surface; however, in 16 of these 17 cases, blast cells demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of Leu-4. This discordance between surface and cytoplasmic expression of Leu-4 was also found in thymocytes and appeared to be restricted to Leu-4, in that tests of other T cell antigens rarely revealed discordance between surface and cytoplasmic expression. To study further the cytoplasmic determinant identified by anti-Leu-4 in malignant T lymphoblasts, immunoprecipitation studies were performed that utilized biosynthetic labeling of established T cell lines derived from T lymphoblastic malignancies. By one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identical Leu-4 polypeptide families were immunoprecipitated from surface Leu-4+ and surface Leu-4-/cytoplasmic Leu-4+ cell lines. Because T lymphoblastic malignancies represent proliferations of immature T cells, and because the cases studied demonstrated surface phenotypes corresponding to all of the proposed stages of T cell ontogeny, it appears that cytoplasmic expression of Leu-4 occurs early in T cell development. The reason for the failure of these immature T cells to transport the Leu-4 molecule to their surface remains to be elucidated.","['Link, M P', 'Stewart, S J', 'Warnke, R A', 'Levy, R']","['Link MP', 'Stewart SJ', 'Warnke RA', 'Levy R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Child', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111954 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Jul;76(1):248-53. doi: 10.1172/JCI111954.,"['CA-21223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32739/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC423757,,,,,,

It was the outcome of a program in synthetic chemistry, at the Medical Research Division of the American Cyanamid Company, which started from a molecule with structural features predicted to favor intercalation with double stranded DNA. The initial lead compound had immunomodulatory effects and was subsequently found also to possess significant activity against transplantable murine tumors. A large series of analogues was synthesized and mitoxantrone was selected for clinical trial on the basis of its potency and excellent antitumor activity in mice. It is a cytotoxic agent that will kill both proliferating and non-proliferating cells. A variety of experiments conducted with both intact cells and cell-free systems have revealed mitoxantrone's ability to bind to single stranded and double stranded RNA and DNA. The drug inhibits cellular RNA and DNA synthesis to about the same extent and causes chromosomal aberrations. In vivo experiments using murine models have demonstrated good activity for mitoxantrone against a variety of transplantable tumors including both leukemias and solid types, in many cases giving putative cures. Surprisingly, it is effective when given up to 30 days before tumor implantation. Combination studies with standard anticancer agents gave evidence of therapeutic synergy in a number of cases. Preclinical studies in several animal models indicate that mitoxantrone does not have the cumulative cardiotoxic liability associated with anthracycline antibiotics such as doxorubicin.","['White, R J', 'Durr, F E']","['White RJ', 'Durr FE']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anthraquinones/therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA/analysis', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00174154 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1985;3(2):85-93. doi: 10.1007/BF00174154.,,,,,,,,

JA3 had been selected because of its ability to release large amounts of IL-2 following stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or anti-T3 antibody in the presence of phorbolmyristate acetate (PMA). This functional property has been exploited for screening of MAbs potentially directed to idiotype-like structures of JA3 cells. Thus supernatants of hybridomas (obtained by fusing mouse splenocytes with P3-UI myeloma cells) were analyzed for their ability to induce JA3 cells to release IL-2 in the presence of PMA. Four stimulatory antibodies reacted with JA3 but not with polyclonal T-cell populations, T-cell clones, or T and B tumor cell lines as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. All 4 antibodies immunoprecipitated the same disulphide-linked heterodimeric molecules having a molecular mass (Mr) of approximately 85,000 under non-reducing conditions that was resolved in 2 major peptides of 40,000 and 45,000 under reducing conditions. These data indicate that these antibodies (termed anti-JTi) were directed to the clonotypic-restricted structures of the JA3 T-cell-receptor molecules. Unlike the anticlonotypic antibodies described so far, anti-JTi MAbs were capable of triggering IL-2 production even in unbound, soluble form, in the absence of adherent cells or PMA. Competitive inhibition experiments, in which 35S-labelled anti-JTi MAbs have been used, provided evidence that they may be directed against different epitopes on the same clonotypic structure.","['Moretta, A', 'Pantaleo, G', 'Lopez-Botet, M', 'Moretta, L']","['Moretta A', 'Pantaleo G', 'Lopez-Botet M', 'Moretta L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1985/08/15 00:00,1985/08/15 00:01,['1985/08/15 00:00'],"['1985/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910360219 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Aug 15;36(2):253-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910360219.,,,,,,,,

The protecting agents employed, thymidine and inosine, circumvent the antipurine and antipyrimidine effects of MTX, but neither agent inhibits the transport or the polyglutamylation of MTX. Nucleoside protection given over 6 hours after MTX markedly decreased toxicity to normal BDF1 mice at MTX doses up to 150 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days. The LD10 for unprotected mice was 14 mg/kg/day, while the LD10 for the protected mice was 114 mg/kg/day, a greater than eightfold increase in the drug dose delivered. MTX with early nucleoside protection produced a 50% increase in median life span in tumor-bearing mice at doses of drug that were toxic to unprotected mice. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that consecutive daily pulses of MTX with early nucleoside protection alter the cell cycle distribution. By 24 hours after the last of three daily pulses of MTX, the G1 component was maximal (80% of the cell population), with less than 2% of the cells in G2M and 17% of the cells in S phase. This distribution persisted for 24 hours, after which a normal pattern emerged, a process that was accelerated by neither thymidine/inosine nor leucovorin. These studies support the concept that toxicity to the host is initiated largely in the interval shortly after MTX administration. The data indicate that early nucleoside protection permits the repetitive administration of much higher doses of MTX than can be given with MTX alone. This approach may be useful not only in the treatment of human neoplasms but in the treatment of other disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or psoriasis. Finally, this paper considers the potential advantages of early thymidine/inosine protection in comparison to leucovorin rescue with the administration of low or moderate doses of MTX.","['Eleff, M', 'Franks, P E', 'Wampler, G L', 'Collins, J M', 'Goldman, I D']","['Eleff M', 'Franks PE', 'Wampler GL', 'Collins JM', 'Goldman ID']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Inosine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Thymidine/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1985 Jul-Aug;69(7-8):867-74.,"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Two basic unknowns are considered important: the identification of virus-exposed, protected individuals; and the isolation of the antigen which contains epitopes which induce a protective response. Although almost all individuals exposed to human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus type III (HTLV-III) develop antibody, most of these do not have neutralizing antibody. The antigen which can induce the response is the major external glycoprotein, which is highly glycosylated (Mr 120,000). Based on past attempts at developing vaccines against retroviruses, the most feasible configuration will be the glycoprotein linked to its transmembrane protein and assembled into micelles or rosettes by hydrophobic bonding. Any virus preparation containing nucleic acids could be considered less safe. An advanced version of such a viral subunit presentation is matrices composed of immunostimulating complexes. This format could also be useful for the inoculation of sequence determined synthetic peptides or genetically engineered readout products of the viral envelope (env) gene. Potential problems exist in that there is extensive heterogeneity among various HTLV-III isolates, particularly in the env gene. This fact and the known relationship of HTLV-III to some lentiviruses suggest that functional antigenic variation could be encountered. The methodology of developing a vaccine against the retroviruses causing AIDS should also be helpful in designing vaccine strategies against human leukemia and lymphomas caused by other members of this virus family.","['Fischinger, P J', 'Robey, W G', 'Koprowski, H', 'Gallo, R C', 'Bolognesi, D P']","['Fischinger PJ', 'Robey WG', 'Koprowski H', 'Gallo RC', 'Bolognesi DP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology', 'HIV Antibodies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', '*Viral Vaccines']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Sep;45(9 Suppl):4694s-4699s.,,,,,,40,,

Thus the virus replication is an important event in the manifestation of this disease, and the interruption of viral replication offers an important strategy for the control of AIDS. For this reason we have purified the reverse transcriptase (RT) from HTLV-III and from HTLV-III infected cells to study the structure-activity relationship of RT inhibitors developed in our laboratory. The cellular DNA polymerases from H9 cells were also purified to study the selectivity of RT inhibitors. Purified HTLV-III RT has several distinguishing features: (a) unlike the HTLV-I enzyme it is highly stable and can be kept for several weeks without any loss of activity; (b) using identical procedures of isolation the HTLV-III enzyme shows a much higher activity than does the enzyme from HTLV-I; (c) the Vmax for HTLV-III RT is by severalfold higher than that for the HTLV-I enzyme in the presence of (rC)n X (dG)12 and (rCm)n X (dG)12, and besides the usual template-primers used for RT assay this enzyme has a relatively high affinity for (rAm)n X (dT)12; and (d) the cationic requirements for the transcription of various template-primers are unusual. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 95,000-98,000, as judged by the gel filtration method. The purified HTLV-III RT was inhibited by a partially thiolated polycytidylic acid (5-mercaptopolycytidylic acid); the cellular DNA polymerase beta from H9 cells was not sensitive to 5-mercaptopolycytidylic acid. Germanin (synonym, suramin), an antiprotozoan drug, also inhibits HTLV-III RT activity, but the DNA polymerase alpha activity was also sensitive to Germanin. The nonspecific effect of Germanin is probably due to the high content of sulfonic acid residues.

These observations suggest elimination of dendritic reticulum cells as part of a pathogenic mechanism in follicular involution.

We compared the toxic effects of various arabinonucleosides against eight human T- and B-lymphoblastoid lines. The arabinosides of cytosine (ara-C), 2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A), adenine (ara-A) and guanine (ara-G) all inhibited the growth of T-lymphoblasts at concentrations below 2 microM. Only ara-G showed strong selectivity for T-cells, as indicated by a 15- to 250-fold greater toxicity toward T-cell lines than B-cell lines. To investigate the biochemical basis for ara-G selectivity, we compared the metabolism of the arabinonucleosides in CCRF-CEM (T-) versus PF-2S (B-) lymphoblasts. Comparison of arabinonucleoside triphosphate accumulation indicated differences favoring selective ara-GTP formation in T-cells. In contrast, ara-C, ara-A, and F-ara-A formed almost corresponding amounts of their triphosphates in both cell types. Triphosphate accumulation correlated directly with inhibition of DNA synthesis in CCRF-CEM and PF-2S cells. PF-2S cells accumulated less than 20% ara-GTP from the nucleoside than did CCRF-CEM cells. Nucleoside kinase measurements showed no significant differences in arabinonucleoside phosphorylation that could account for the preferential ara-GTP accumulation in T-cells. After removal of arabinonucleoside-containing medium, ara-GTP levels in PF-2S cells declined with a half-life of 49 min whereas, in CCRF-CEM cells, the level of analogue triphosphate remained unchanged. Furthermore, the half-life of ara-CTP, ara-ATP, and F-ara-ATP in the B-cells was 3- to 5-fold longer than that of ara-GTP. These results indicate that ara-G is more selective than other known arabinonucleosides; such selectivity warrants further assessment of the therapeutic potential of this agent against T-cell malignancies and other lymphoid disorders.","['Verhoef, V', 'Fridland, A']","['Verhoef V', 'Fridland A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '3714-60-1 (ara-ATP)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Phosphorylation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Aug;45(8):3646-50.,['CA 33017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Cytogenetically, eight cases of N type and five of N/M type had the t(15;17) abnormality. Thus at least two differentiation patterns were observed in M3 leukemia with fidelity (N type) and infidelity (N/M type) for normal granulocytic differentiation. In this series, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical features (remission rate and survival) between the two types. Our study suggests that the development of M3 leukemia is not exclusively restricted to the neutrophilic pathway, but more heterogeneously related to myelomonocytic differentiation.","['Tomonaga, M', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Tagawa, M', 'Jinnai, I', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Amenomori, T', 'Yoshioka, A', 'Matsuo, T', 'Nonaka, H', 'Ichimaru, M']","['Tomonaga M', 'Yoshida Y', 'Tagawa M', 'Jinnai I', 'Kuriyama K', 'Amenomori T', 'Yoshioka A', 'Matsuo T', 'Nonaka H', 'Ichimaru M']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81425-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Aug;66(2):350-7.,,,,,,,,

Antigenicities were found exclusively on minor glycolipids which were barely or not at all detectable with orcinol-sulphuric acid stain. Among these, a neutral glycosphingolipid bound the anti-i antibody Den and chromatographed as the ceramide octasaccharide, Gal beta 1----4GlcNac beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNac beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Glc-Cer. Several species of neutral glycosphingolipids with six to more than ten monosaccharides were detected which carry the X antigen and others the Y antigen: Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc and Fuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc, respectively. In addition, three new types of carbohydrate specificities were detected among the myeloid cell glycolipids. Two were associated with neutral glycolipids: the first, recognised by anti-myeloid antibodies VIM-1 and VIM-10, was expressed on a distinct set of glycolipids with six or more monosaccharides, and the second, recognized by VIM-8, was expressed on glycolipids with more than ten monosaccharides. The third specificity, recognised by the anti-myeloid antibody VIM-2, was expressed on slow migrating sialoglycolipids with backbone structures of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine type that are susceptible to degradation with endo-beta-galactosidase. Thus, we conclude that the i and Y antigens occur among the glycolipids of normal myeloid and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and that a high proportion of hybridoma antibodies raised against differentiation antigens of myeloid cells are directed at carbohydrate structures.","['Uemura, K', 'Macher, B A', 'DeGregorio, M', 'Scudder, P', 'Buehler, J', 'Knapp, W', 'Feizi, T']","['Uemura K', 'Macher BA', 'DeGregorio M', 'Scudder P', 'Buehler J', 'Knapp W', 'Feizi T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Carbohydrates/*immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Glycolipids/immunology', 'Glycosphingolipids/*immunology', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology']",1985/07/30 00:00,1985/07/30 00:01,['1985/07/30 00:00'],"['1985/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(85)90106-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(85)90106-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1985 Jul 30;846(1):26-36. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(85)90106-5.,['CA 32826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The PC-binding proteins were extracted from the detergent lysate of biosynthetically radiolabeled P388D1 cells by affinity chromatography on PC-Sepharose and filtered through a Sephadex G-100 gel column in the presence of 6 M urea. Isoelectric focusing of the gel-filtered materials in the presence of 6 M urea revealed the presence of a major protein component of pIe of 5.8 and minor heterogeneous cellular proteins. The yield of the electrofocused PC-binding proteins based on protein determination by Lowry's method ranged from 0.7 to 4 mg per 10(9) cells. The purified PC-binding proteins appeared to be tightly associated with Triton X-100 and phospholipids in the weight ratio of 0.57 and 0.05 g/g of proteins, respectively. The majority of lipids that could be extracted from the PC-binding proteins by chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) are free fatty acids, whereas lipids extracted from Pronase-treated PC-binding proteins contained phosphatidylethanolamine. By amino acid analysis, the purified PC-binding proteins were found to consist of a minimum of 417 amino acid residues, suggesting a minimum molecular weight of about 38 000 for this protein. Results of radiolabeling experiments with [3H]glucosamine and amino acid analysis both showed the presence of a mole of glucosamine per a mole of the PC-binding proteins, suggesting their glycoprotein nature. About 40% of the purified PC-binding proteins coprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Fc gamma 2bR antibody (2.4G2) in detergent-containing buffer, whereas only 6% of the isolated IgG binding proteins reacted with this antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fernandez-Botran, R', 'Suzuki, T']","['Fernandez-Botran R', 'Suzuki T']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Detergents', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Octoxynol', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/analysis', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Receptors, Fc/immunology/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Tritium']",1985/04/09 00:00,1985/04/09 00:01,['1985/04/09 00:00'],"['1985/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00329a014 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1985 Apr 9;24(8):1896-903. doi: 10.1021/bi00329a014.,['AI 17818/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The DxS-induced cellular thymidine uptake was the most powerful predictor of prognosis. Eighteen patients with leukaemic cells responding to DxS stimulation had a median therapy-free survival of 17 months and a probability of 5 year therapy-free survival of less than 0.1, whereas for 30 patients with DxS unresponsive cells the corresponding figures were greater than 120 months and greater than 0.7, respectively (log rank, P less than 0.0001).

The differential diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary disease in this setting includes (1) infection, most commonly from opportunistic organisms; (2) recurrence or extension of the basic underlying disease process to involve the lungs; (3) adverse pulmonary reaction to drugs; (4) a new, unrelated disease process such as cardiac pulmonary edema or pulmonary emboli; and (5) any combination of these categories. Up to a third of these patients have two or more complications, such as pneumonitis from two different opportunistic organisms or an opportunistic infection and a drug-induced pulmonary complication. An understanding of the host defense that is compromised enables the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis. The most common types of impairment of defense mechanisms are reductions in the number of granulocytes, B-lymphocytes, or T-lymphocytes, and not uncommonly, two or all three of these types of cells are involved. Impairment of each of these cell types is associated with an increased frequency of infection by a particular group of organisms. Consequently, the clinician can be somewhat selective if empiric therapy is being considered. In the immunocompromised patient, most pulmonary complications, including drug-induced pulmonary disease and pulmonary emboli, are associated with fever that mimics an infection.

The data presented in the present study demonstrate that, when normal T lymphocytes are cultured with or without irradiated non-T cells in the presence of soluble S511 antibody, a concentration- and time-dependent proliferation of the S511-reactive population occurred. Proliferation indices as high as 184 times greater than control were observed, which represents a major stimulatory effect on the initially minor S511+ subset. When S511+ cells were studied for evidence of prior activation, they were shown to be unresponsive to interleukin 2 (IL-2) unless exposed to S511 antibody, and were shown to be in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, the S511 antibody activated resting normal T cells in a manner analogous to specific antigen binding to the T cell antigen receptor. The leukemic S511 molecule has been shown previously to differ from most other antigen receptors in the mobility of the two chains at 43 and 38 kD and the neutral isoelectric point of each chain. Expansion of reactive normal cells by S511-Sepharose permitted the development of IL-2-dependent T cell lines enriched for S511-bearing cells. The antigen receptor molecules on one such polyclonal S511-enriched T cell line were immunoprecipitated with S511 antibody and shown to have comparable mobility to that present on the leukemic cells, but to possess a greater heterogeneity of mobility. Thus, the leukemic cells and normal cells express similar T cell receptor molecules.

The sensory neuropeptides have direct effects on the functions of smooth muscles, blood vessels, leukocytes, and epithelial glands and indirect effects through the actions of mediators released from mast cells stimulated by the peptides. Sensory neuropeptides exhibit cellular specificity, as exemplified by the greater potency of substance P in activating mucosal mast cells than connective tissue mast cells. The capacity of somatostatin to inhibit release of mediators from basophils challenged by IgE-dependent mechanisms, but not by basic peptides or ionophores, illustrates the biochemical specificity of the neuropeptides. The selective release of distinct sensory neuropeptides from different subsets of nerve endings, the specificity of neuropeptide recognition by mast cells, basophils, and other target cells, and the diversity of direct and indirect activities of the neuropeptides suggest that sensory nerves may initiate and modulate immediate hypersensitivity by unique mechanisms.","['Goetzl, E J', 'Chernov, T', 'Renold, F', 'Payan, D G']","['Goetzl EJ', 'Chernov T', 'Renold F', 'Payan DG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Endorphins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '39379-15-2 (Neurotensin)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)']",IM,"['Basophils/physiology', 'Endorphins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Mast Cells/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Neurotensin/physiology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/*physiology', 'Somatostatin/physiology', 'Substance P/physiology', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/physiology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Aug;135(2 Suppl):802s-805s.,"['AI-19784/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-31809/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Cross-clearing studies demonstrate that 7G7/B6 binds the same cell surface molecule(s) as anti-Tac, a MAb which has been shown previously to recognize the human receptor for IL-2. 35S-methionine pulse chase experiments in HUT 102B2 cells reveal that 7G7/B6 binds to an early (less than 30 min) 35-37 kD and late (greater than 4 h) 50 kD protein. Sequential immunoprecipitations demonstrate that these are identical to the molecules identified by anti-Tac under similar conditions. However, only anti-Tac coprecipitates a higher molecular band at 110 kD. 7G7/B6 and anti-Tac do not competitively inhibit the binding of each other to PHA-activated T-cells. Functional studies reveal that in contrast to anti-Tac, 7G7/B6 has almost no inhibitory effect in vitro on IL-2-driven proliferation of IL-2-dependent T-cell lines, or alloimmune cytotoxic T-cell generation (however, once generated, these cytotoxic T-cells were both 7G7/B6 and anti-Tac positive). Finally, IL-2 does not inhibit the binding of 7G7/B6 to activated T-cells under conditions which result in up to 75% inhibition of anti-Tac binding. Therefore, 7G7/B6 is another MAb recognizing the human IL-2 receptor, but binding to an epitope distinct from that recognized by either IL-2 or anti-Tac.","['Rubin, L A', 'Kurman, C C', 'Biddison, W E', 'Goldman, N D', 'Nelson, D L']","['Rubin LA', 'Kurman CC', 'Biddison WE', 'Goldman ND', 'Nelson DL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hybridoma,Hybridoma,8202424,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hyb.1985.4.91 [doi]'],ppublish,Hybridoma. 1985 Summer;4(2):91-102. doi: 10.1089/hyb.1985.4.91.,,,,,,,,

The putative polymerase of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) shows striking homology with the putative polymerase of 17.6 over almost its entire length, but it lacks the DNA endonuclease-related sequence.

By comparing the DNA elution rate at pH 12.1 and 12.6, it was found that the drug produced DNA alkali-labile lesions. Alkali-labile sites were present only in DNA strands that were synthesized in the presence of the drug. They persisted for at least 48 h after drug treatment, and only after 72 h did the number of alkali-labile sites decline, thus suggesting a slow repair process. The production of alkali-labile sites was found to be concentration dependent and observable at concentrations which were effective in inhibiting the clonogenic viability of L1210 cells and which are attainable in vivo. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine did not cause other DNA lesions such as DNA double-strand breaks or DNA-protein cross-links. Two hypotheses were considered to explain the origin of alkali-labile lesions in DNA that has incorporated 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine: (a) the production of apyrimidinic sites by a glycosylase that recognizes and removes aza-cytosine from DNA and (b) the alkali-catalyzed decomposition of azacytosine residues to ring-opened products which could lead to alkali-induced DNA strand scission through a beta-elimination mechanism. The second hypothesis was considered to be the more probable and suggests that the alkali lability may be a means by which one could determine the extent of substitution and precise location of azacytosine residues or their ring-opened products in DNA.","[""D'Incalci, M"", 'Covey, J M', 'Zaharko, D S', 'Kohn, K W']","[""D'Incalci M"", 'Covey JM', 'Zaharko DS', 'Kohn KW']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkalies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Alkalies', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jul;45(7):3197-202.,,,,,,,,

In the first case it mainly induced leukemias, while in the latter experiments leukemias, lung adenomas and soft tissue sarcomas represent the main effects. The experiments performed on gestation day 14 led to tumor rates below the spontaneously occurring tumor frequencies in NMRI-mice. There is a clear-cut inverse dose-response relationship in leukemia induction, as the higher dose principally shows a lower degree of effectiveness. This, as well as a reduction of tumor frequency below control levels after application of this drug on day 14, can be explained by an ""overkill"" effect. The cytotoxic and embryolethal efficacy of the agent thus surpasses the transformation effects at the cellular genome.

A mediastinal mass is one of the most characteristic presentations in this particular disorder. This report describes four children with ALL, who presented with a mediastinal mass. Three patients were E-rosette-negative and one was E-rosette-positive. Individual surface phenotypes, defined by a panel of monoclonal antibodies, were quite different. Since Ig gene organization is an essential property of cells of B-lineage, it was surprising to find that analysis of genomic DNA revealed immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements in two of them. These findings suggest that there is significant heterogeneity even among those leukemias associated with a mediastinal mass, and that a mediastinal mass may not clearly indicate origin from cells of T-lineage. This heterogeneity may reflect differences in leukemogenesis and may have prognostic and therapeutic implications.","['Ha, K', 'Minden, M', 'Hozumi, N', 'Gelfand, E W']","['Ha K', 'Minden M', 'Hozumi N', 'Gelfand EW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19850801)56:3<509::aid-cncr2820560317>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1985 Aug 1;56(3):509-13. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19850801)56:3<509::aid-cncr2820560317>3.0.co;2-2.,,,,,,,,

This possibility has been studied by searching for an age-dependent increase in the expression of specific genes in tissues where expression of these genes would not normally be expected. In these studies, cDNA probes of specific genes are used in a DNA X NA hybridization assay to detect possible complementary RNA sequences in tissues of different-aged animals. Using this technique in past experiments, a qualitative increase in the RNA sequence complexity of mouse leukemia virus (MuLV) and a quantitative increase in the amount of alpha- and beta-globin RNA were found with increasing age in the brain and liver of the C57BL/6J mouse strain. We report here a similar age-dependent qualitative increase in the RNA sequence complexity for mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) but no quantitative or qualitative age-dependent change in casein RNA sequences for the same tissues and mouse strain.","['Dean, R G', 'Socher, S H', 'Cutler, R G']","['Dean RG', 'Socher SH', 'Cutler RG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Arch Gerontol Geriatr,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,8214379,"['0 (Caseins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['*Aging', 'Animals', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Caseins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Liver/analysis', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogenes', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/05 00:00 [received]', '1984/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167494385900172 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4943(85)90017-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Gerontol Geriatr. 1985 Apr;4(1):43-51. doi: 10.1016/0167-4943(85)90017-2.,['CA-27293/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Recent advances in biology and treatment.,101-20,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a hematologic neoplasm characterized by proliferation and accumulation of mature-appearing lymphocytes. Most cases involve a clonal proliferation of B lymphocytes. The cells typically have low levels of surface immunoglobulin; usually mu or mu and delta heavy chains, and either kappa or lambda light chains. The cells also show receptors for mouse erythrocytes, Fc receptors for IgG, complement receptors, Ia antigens, and B-cell-associated antigens. Although chronic lymphocytic leukemia is usually a stable disease over months to years, transformation of both clinical and biological features may occur. Prognostic factors include the leukemia cell count (greater than 40 X 10(9)/L), anemia, thrombocytopenia, chromosome abnormalities, and the pattern of bone marrow involvement. Alkylating agents, radiation therapy, and corticosteroids are commonly used to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Although these agents are useful, few data show that survival has been substantially improved. Recently, biological response modifiers such as monoclonal antibodies and interferon have been studied.","['Gale, R P', 'Foon, K A']","['Gale RP', 'Foon KA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/etiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/etiology/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogenes', 'Prognosis', 'Splenectomy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-103-1-101 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1985 Jul;103(1):101-20. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-103-1-101.,"['CA23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,313,,

We have used this regulatory mechanism to drive expression of foreign genes inserted in retrovirus vectors. This approach was used to express the human IL-2 gene in IL-2-dependent mouse CTLL-2 cells to determine the role of autonomous growth in maintaining proliferation of virus-infected T lymphocytes during HTLV-1-induced adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Expression of IL-2 sequences in IL-2-dependent mouse CTLL-2 cells resulted in autonomous growth of IL-2-independent CTLL-2 clones. Endogenous expression of IL-2 appeared to interrupt normal constraints of growth in that these IL-2-independent clones showed reduced cell-density-dependent inhibition but not a tumorigenic phenotype. IL-2-independent CTLL-2 clones did not secrete detectable quantities of IL-2 into culture supernatant and exhibited reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of both IL-2 and IL-2 receptor antibody. These results suggest that the IL-2 autocrine loop within these cells involves intracellular IL-2/IL-2 receptor binding. The apparent lack of IL-2 production and poor responsiveness to IL-2 or IL-2 antibodies displayed by cell lines from ATL patients may be explained by an intracellular IL-2/IL-2 receptor autocrine loop.,"['Shapiro, I M', 'Meier, C', 'Vlach, V', 'McDonald, T L', 'Wigzell, H', 'Stevenson, M']","['Shapiro IM', 'Meier C', 'Vlach V', 'McDonald TL', 'Wigzell H', 'Stevenson M']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'Clone Cells', 'Genes, tat/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01650475 [doi]'],ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 1990 Jan;16(1):1-14. doi: 10.1007/BF01650475.,,,,,,,,

As such, use of CD9 for marrow purging may result in the removal of a broad range of cell populations not related to the underlying disorder.","['Fort, J A', 'Rios, A M', 'Gross, S', 'Janssen, W E']","['Fort JA', 'Rios AM', 'Gross S', 'Janssen WE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville 32610.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tetraspanin 29']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;333:185-9.,['CA29281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

These cells resemble osteoclasts in their morphology, possess receptors for calcitonin, and resorb bone in culture. The effects of several hemopoietic regulatory proteins on the generation of these cells were examined in this study. Interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating factor (GMCSF), and macrophage-stimulating factor strongly inhibited generation of the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-containing multinucleated cells with approximate EC50 values of 3, 6, and 3 colony-forming units/ml, respectively. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor had no effect on the generation of these cells. In addition, we observed that the number of these cells was reduced when the bone marrow was plated at high cell density, and that this inhibitory effect was reversed by the addition of neutralizing antibodies directed against GMCSF. These findings suggest that GMCSF and other hemopoietic factors secreted by cells in the bone marrow regulate development of the osteoclast-like cells, possibly by diverting common precursor cells to alternate pathways.","['Shinar, D M', 'Sato, M', 'Rodan, G A']","['Shinar DM', 'Sato M', 'Rodan GA']","['Department of Bone Biology and Osteoporosis Research, Merck, Sharp, and Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, Pennsylvania 19486.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Tartrates)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'W4888I119H (tartaric acid)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology/physiology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Calcitonin/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/immunology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tartrates/pharmacology']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo-126-3-1728 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1990 Mar;126(3):1728-35. doi: 10.1210/endo-126-3-1728.,,,,,,,,

Patients in CCSG and CALGB receiving IF + MOPP had significantly superior RFS at 5 years than patients receiving EF. Survival rate was not different between these two groups, an estimated 93% of patients surviving 5 years or longer.

There was some statistical evidence that RFS was superior at 5 years for patients receiving EF than for IF; however, there was no evidence of a difference in survival experience. The percentages of patients with late effects of therapy were not significantly different by treatment. The most common types of late effects were endocrine dysfunction and impaired resistance to infection. Overall, the response rate to therapy for relapse patients was good, being 83% among all patients who relapsed.

These point mutations have been detected in a variety of human malignancies. However, their relevance for the clinical and biologic behavior of the subgroups of patients exhibiting these mutations in unclear. We analyzed 100 patients with childhood acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALLs) for point mutations of exons 1 and 2 of all three ras genes (H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras) by polymerase chain reaction and a combination of oligonucleotide hybridization and direct DNA sequencing. A 6% incidence of N-ras gene mutations was detected, all of which occurred at different nucleotides of codons 12 or 13 of N-ras. When correlating presence of ras mutations with the clinical and biologic features and the clinical outcome of these cases, a significantly higher risk for hematologic relapse (P = .01) and a trend toward a lower rate of complete remission (P = .07) was noted. The two groups did not differ in any of the known high-risk factors of ALL. These results suggest that presence of an N-ras mutation in children with ALL may be an independent predictor for worse clinical outcome and therefore may have therapeutic implications; further studies to confirm these findings are required because of the small number of patients with N-ras mutations.","['Lubbert, M', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Miller, C W', 'Kahan, J', 'Isaac, G', 'Kitchingman, G', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Herrmann, F', 'McCormick, F', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Lubbert M', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Miller CW', 'Kahan J', 'Isaac G', 'Kitchingman G', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Herrmann F', 'McCormick F', 'Koeffler HP']",['UCLA Department of Medicine.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1990/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84450-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Mar 1;75(5):1163-9.,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 71765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

In about 50% of the Ph-positive acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL), the bcr-abl gene fusion is identical to CML, while in 50% an alternative fusion between these two genes occurs, in which the central bcr-sequences are absent. This results in transcription of a 7 kb bcr-abl mRNA, encoding a P190bcr-abl fusion protein. Cloning and sequencing of the chimeric part of bcr-abl cDNAs from two Ph-positive CML patients in chronic phase showed that in one patient, as in the Ph-positive ALL, all central bcr sequences are absent, while in the other patient, part of the bcr central sequences are deleted. Therefore, we speculate that the presence of the 7 kb chimeric ALL type mRNA in one of the patients is not sufficient to drive an acute rather than a chronic leukemic process in this case.

Report of five cases and review.,64-9,"Thyroid lymphoma is a rare disease seen most commonly in elderly women and associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Five cases of thyroid lymphoma seen and treated at Hahnemann University Hospital between 1979 and 1988 are retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent a staging workup, including chest radiograph, intravenous pyelography, abdominal/pelvic computed tomogram (CT) scan and/or lymphangiogram, and bone marrow. An extensive review of the literature is presented. Risk factors for thyroid lymphoma are discussed, enabling the clinician to differentiate thyroid lymphoma from thyroid carcinoma. Thyroidectomy may be indicated in a small number of cases, provided that the patient has disease localized within the thyroid such that total gross resection can be achieved. It is proposed that patients with bad prognostic factors may benefit from the administration of chemotherapy initially before or after radiotherapy rather than using chemotherapy as salvage therapy. Irradiating the patient to the neck and mediastinum to 40 Gy, in 4-5 weeks, is recommended, except possibly for tumor that is extremely well localized in the neck. Finally, the necessity of a full staging work-up, including lymphangiogram and/or abdominal/pelvic CT is emphasized.","['Butler, J S Jr', 'Brady, L W', 'Amendola, B E']","['Butler JS Jr', 'Brady LW', 'Amendola BE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology and Nuclear Medicine, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA 19102.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*pathology']",1990/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-199002000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1990 Feb;13(1):64-9. doi: 10.1097/00000421-199002000-00017.,,,,,,15,,

To determine whether P210bcr/abl can induce chronic myelogenous leukemia, murine bone marrow was infected with a retrovirus encoding P210bcr/abl and transplanted into irradiated syngeneic recipients. Transplant recipients developed several hematologic malignancies; prominent among them was a myeloproliferative syndrome closely resembling the chronic phase of human chronic myelogenous leukemia. Tumor tissue from diseased mice harbored the provirus encoding P210bcr/abl. These results demonstrate that P210bcr/abl expression can induce chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Specific nursing interventions aimed at supporting bone marrow suppressed patients have been addressed in the literature and other reports in this issue. The potential for oncologic emergencies in these rare leukemias is great. These include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), cerebral and pulmonary leukostasis, sepsis, and acute renal failure. Recognition that patients are at risk for these acute events prepares nurses for their assessment, diagnosis, and plans of care. Eleven high-incidence problems for cancer patients have been described, and all can be applied to these patients. Emotionally, patients and their families rely on nurses to assist them in coping with a new diagnosis of cancer, and/or dealing with the chronic nature of their disease. Open communication, firmly based on a thorough knowledge of the particular disease and treatment, will promote trust and a sense of comfort as the patient begins treatment. Finally, it is important for all nurses caring for cancer patients to identify their personal feelings and biases. In the current environment where clinical investigation is a part of everyday care, the nurse must be comfortable with the research process and the participation of human subjects in clinical trials. Nurses play a role in the development of clinical trials and the process of informed consent, and in the management of patients involved in clinical trials. Over the last 5 years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of therapies available for one particular rare leukemia (hairy cell leukemia).

Codons 969 and 301 have been identified as potentially involved in promoting the transforming activity of FMS. Mutations at codon 301 are believed to lead to neoplastic transformation by ligand independence and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. The tyrosine residue at codon 969 has been shown to be involved in a negative regulatory activity, which is disrupted by amino acid substitutions. This study reports on the frequency of point mutations at these codons, in vivo, in human myeloid malignancies and in normal subjects. We studied 110 patients [67 with myelodysplasia (MDS) and 48 with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)], 5 patients being studied at the MDS and the later AML stage of the disease. There was a total incidence of 12.7% (14/110) with mutations in codon 969 and 1.8% (2/110) with mutations in codon 301. Two patients had mutations in the AML stage of the disease but not in the preceding MDS and one had a mutation in the MDS stage but not upon transformation of AML. This is consistent with the somatic origin of these mutations. FMS mutations were most prevalent (20%) in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and AML type M4 (23%), both of which are characterized by monocytic differentiation. One of 51 normal subjects had a constitutional codon 969 mutation, which may represent a marker for predisposition to myeloid malignancy.","['Ridge, S A', 'Worwood, M', 'Oscier, D', 'Jacobs, A', 'Padua, R A']","['Ridge SA', 'Worwood M', 'Oscier D', 'Jacobs A', 'Padua RA']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Anemia/genetics', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Codon/genetics', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*genetics', 'DNA/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/*genetics', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', 'Reference Values']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.4.1377 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Feb;87(4):1377-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.4.1377.,,PMC53478,,,,,,

The same agents induce transcription from the interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain and interleukin-2 genes, depending on promoter elements that bind the inducible transcription factor NF-kappa B (or an NF-kappa B-like factor). We therefore tested the possibility that the GM-CSF gene is also regulated by a cognate motif for the NF-kappa B transcription factor. A recent functional analysis by Miyatake et al. (S. Miyatake, M. Seiki, M. Yoshida, and K. Arai, Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:5581-5587, 1988) described a short promoter region in the GM-CSF gene that conferred strong inducibility by T-cell-activating signals and tax1, but no NF-kappa B-binding motifs were identified. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we showed binding of purified human NF-kappa B and of the NF-kappa B activated in Jurkat T cells to an oligonucleotide comprising the GM-CSF promoter element responsible for mediating responsiveness to T-cell-activating signals and tax1. As shown by a methylation interference analysis and oligonucleotide competition experiments, purified NF-kappa B binds at positions -82 to -91 (GGGAACTACC) of the GM-CSF promoter sequence with an affinity similar to that with which it binds to the biologically functional kappa B motif in the beta interferon promoter (GGGAAATTCC). Two kappa B-like motifs at positions -98 to -108 of the GM-CSF promoter were also recognized but with much lower affinities. Our data provide strong evidence that the expression of the GM-CSF gene following T-cell activation is controlled by binding of the NF-kappa B transcription factor to a high-affinity binding site in the GM-CSF promoter.","['Schreck, R', 'Baeuerle, P A']","['Schreck R', 'Baeuerle PA']","['Laboratorium fur molekulare Biologie Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Factors/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*genetics', 'Cytokines', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.10.3.1281-1286.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Mar;10(3):1281-6. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.3.1281-1286.1990.,,PMC361021,,,,,,

In some instances abnormal expression of these genes is associated with altered cell growth or with malignant transformation. Abnormalities of cellular oncogenes are common in human leukemias. These arise by multiple mechanisms such as mutation, translocation, amplification, and others. Sometimes more than one abnormality is present within a single oncogene. In other instances, a leukemia cell may contain abnormalities of several different oncogenes. Some oncogene abnormalities are relatively specific for certain leukemias and occur in almost all cases; examples include ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia or MYC in Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma. Other abnormalities are also relatively specific but occur in only some cases such as NRAS in acute myelogenous leukemia or BCL2 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In other leukemias, such as most cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, oncogene abnormalities are uncommon. The precise role of oncogenes in the pathogenesis of human leukemia is unknown. Retrovirus transduced versions of some of the oncogenes modified in human leukemias cause leukemia in animals. Other oncogenes, modified or unmodified, transform animal and human hematopoietic cells in vitro. Some oncogene products are hematopoietic growth factors or growth factor receptors while others regulate cell proliferation or differentiation by diverse mechanisms. Disruption of the balance between these processes seems the most likely mechanism of oncogene related leukemogenesis. If the role of oncogenes in human leukemias can be defined, innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies may be forthcoming.","['Butturini, A', 'Gale, R P']","['Butturini A', 'Gale RP']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Feb;4(2):138-60.,,,,,,290,,

Insulin binding sites decreased from 20-25,000 per cell in G0/G1 to 1-2,000 in S and increased to 30-50,000 in G2 + M. The affinity of insulin binding remained nearly constant during the cell cycle. The specificity of the insulin receptor could also be demonstrated by covalent crosslinking of the receptor to radiolabeled ligand in all enriched cell fractions. Glucose transport was stimulated by insulin independently of cell cycle. An increase to 140% of control was observed at an insulin concentration of 10 ng/ml. In contrast, glycogen synthesis could only be stimulated by insulin in the G0/G1 phase. An increase to 140% of control was already reached at 0.25 ng/ml insulin.

However, the literature is replete with articles alluding to distinctive features of acute monoblastic leukemia (AMoL). This review addresses the unique clinical, laboratory, epidemiological, and therapeutic features of AMoL. Leukemic monoblasts are distinguished from other cells in the myelocytic series by physical properties such as greater adhesiveness, deformability, and motility. Patients with AMoL often exhibit hyperleukocytosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and extramedullary involvement, particularly in the skin, gingiva, and central nervous system (CNS). AMoL occurs predominantly in adults over 40 and children under 10, fifty percent of whom are under 2 years of age at diagnosis. Its relatively common occurrence in infants parallels the high rate of proliferation of monocytes in that age group. Additionally, its occurrence in young children appears to be associated with in utero exposure to marijuana and parental exposure to pesticides and solvents. Therapeutic results are generally poor due to high rates of fatal complications during induction, induction failures, and frequent extramedullary and medullary relapses. This poor outcome is particularly noted in infants. Higher remission induction rates attained with epipodophyllotoxins and incorporation of bone marrow transplantation have not yet resulted in substantial improvement of long-term outcome. Recurrence of disease in the CNS is minimized by the use of intensive CNS presymptomatic treatment, usually incorporating irradiation.

The DMSO-induced U-937 monocytic phenotype was associated with 1) growth inhibition, 2) loss of clonogenic survival, 3) increases in alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (NSE) staining, and 4) increases in cell surface expression of the monocyte marker Mac-1. DMSO treatment of U-937 cells was also associated with down-regulation of c-myc and c-myb gene expression as well as with increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA levels. The results further demonstrate that induction of U-937 monocytic differentiation by DMSO is accompanied by increases in phospholipase A2 activity. Moreover, this stimulation of phospholipase A2 was sensitive to dexamethasone. We therefore studied the effects of dexamethasone on DMSO-induced differentiation of U-937 cells. Although dexamethasone had no effect on growth inhibition or loss of clonogenic survival by DMSO, this glucocorticoid blocked increases in NSE staining and cell surface Mac-1 expression. Dexamethasone also had no effect on the down-regulation of c-myc and c-myb expression but blocked the reappearance of c-myb transcripts after 6 hr of DMSO treatment. Finally, dexamethasone inhibited DMSO-induced increases in TNF gene expression. Taken together, the results demonstrate that dexamethasone inhibits multiple characteristics, including the stimulation of phospholipase A2 activity, associated with DMSO-induced monocytic differentiation of U-937 cells.","['Nakamura, T', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Spriggs, D', 'Kufe, D']","['Nakamura T', 'Kharbanda S', 'Spriggs D', 'Kufe D']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Monocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041420207 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1990 Feb;142(2):261-7. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041420207.,['CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Our results indicate that interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) is an important factor in the resistance of allogeneic mice to the multiplication of FLC in the liver. (a) After i.v. inoculation of FLC there was an inverse correlation between the presence of IFN-alpha in the serum and the capacity of FLC to multiply in the liver. Thus, all 44 FLC-injected adult C57B1/6 mice had circulating IFN-alpha and FLC did not multiply in the liver of any of the mice. Interferon was not detected in the serum of 83% of 41 FLC-injected DBA/2 mice (and was found only at a low titer in 17% of the mice) and FLC multiplied in the liver of all mice. (b) FLC did multiply in the livers of newborn C57B1/6 mice and in the livers of irradiated adult C57B1/6 mice, and IFN-alpha was not detected in their sera. In contrast, after i.v. inoculation of FLC, IFN-alpha was detected in the sera of 3-week-old and athymic nu/nu adult C57B1/6 mice while FLC failed to multiply in the liver. (c) FLC also induced IFN-alpha in congenic B10.D2 (H-2d) mice and FLC did not multiply in the liver. We suggest that, depending on the site of tumor implantation, different host mechanisms have various degrees of importance in controlling the growth and/or rejection of allogeneic tumor cells, and that IFN-alpha is particularly important when FLC are injected i.v.","['Gresser, I', 'Maury, C', 'Bandu, M T', 'Belardelli, F']","['Gresser I', 'Maury C', 'Bandu MT', 'Belardelli F']","['Laboratory of Viral Oncology, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon Type I/blood/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910450226 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Feb 15;45(2):364-71. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910450226.,,,,,,,,

However, achieving and maintaining high levels of gene expression in transfected hematopoietic progenitor cells remains problematic. In order to address this problem we examined the effect of different viral and cellular promoters on the transient expression of reporter genes transferred into K562, KG1a, and human marrow stromal cells. We found that although the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat was most active in K562 cells in a transient expression assay, the murine cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter was strikingly more active than the other promoters in KG1a cells as well as in the marrow stromal cell population. Long-term stable gene expression was also demonstrated in stromal cells. We infer that the murine cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter may be highly active in human hematopoietic progenitor cells and that human marrow stromal cells may be an attractive vehicle for gene delivery.","['Keating, A', 'Horsfall, W', 'Hawley, R G', 'Toneguzzo, F']","['Keating A', 'Horsfall W', 'Hawley RG', 'Toneguzzo F']","['Oncology Research, Toronto General Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic System/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', '*Transfection']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Feb;18(2):99-102.,,,,,,,,

A purified blast cell fraction depleted of both T cells and phagocytic cells was tested at different cell densities. Addition of 1 ng/ml of IL-1 alpha alone enhanced blast colony formation in 10 of 13 cases tested, and the enhancement was prominent when plated cell densities were lowered. The conditioned media (CM) from AML patients contained varied levels of IL-1 activity, and following depletion of phagocytic cells, the levels decreased markedly in all cases tested. Addition of either antiserum against IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta reduced the IL-1 activity in CM, suggesting that AML blasts produce both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Addition of IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta antiserum inhibited blast colony formation in a dose-dependent manner, and a combination of both antisera showed the most marked inhibition. However, the augmentation of blast colony formation was almost completely inhibited by addition of anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) serum in all three cases tested. IL-1 is also devoid of this activity when tested in the presence of a combination of granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), GM-CSF, and interleukin 3 (IL-3) at an optimal concentration. These results suggest that blast cells could produce and secrete CSF(s) and/or IL-1, and that the growth-enhancing effect of IL-1 on AML blasts is indirect, via production of CSFs by leukemic cells.","['Murohashi, I', 'Tohda, S', 'Suzuki, T', 'Nagata, K', 'Yamashita, Y', 'Nara, N']","['Murohashi I', 'Tohda S', 'Suzuki T', 'Nagata K', 'Yamashita Y', 'Nara N']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Colony-Stimulating Factors/immunology/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*pathology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Feb;18(2):133-7.,,,,,,,,

Anti-Tac is a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the Tac peptide. Our prior attempts to use this antibody in humans for antitumor therapy and immune regulation have been limited by weak recruitment of effector functions and neutralization by antibodies to mouse immunoglobulins. To circumvent these difficulties, we prepared several chimeric ""humanized"" anti-Tac antibodies by genetic engineering, including one ""hyperchimeric"" antibody (anti-Tac-II) in which the molecule is human except for the small hypervariable segments of the complementarity-determining regions retained from the mouse antibody. These constructs maintain high affinities for antigen and abilities to block T-cell activation and demonstrate new capabilities to perform antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, absent in the mouse anti-Tac.

A review.,770-5,"The author reviewed the question of late side effects of cancer treatment. A late side effect was defined as an unwanted and deleterious effect observed for the first time 12 months or longer after treatment. In a survey of articles published by The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet from 1968 to 1988, nine categories of late side effects were identified: second cancers, hormonal and reproductive effects, effects on the immunologic system, heart disease, effects on kidney and urinary bladder, effects on gastrointestinal organs, neurologic and psychological effects, pulmonary toxicity, and osteonecrosis. The induction of second cancers is a particularly important late side effect of cancer treatment. Several epidemiologic studies demonstrated increased risks of leukemia and solid tumors in patients exposed to radiotherapy. Large increases in leukemia risk have also been observed after chemotherapy with alkylating agents. However, several research questions remain unanswered, including the duration of the excess cancer risk after treatment, and the independent effect of various drugs on second cancer risk.","['Boivin, J F']",['Boivin JF'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19900201)65:3+<770::aid-cncr2820651323>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Feb 1;65(3 Suppl):770-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900201)65:3+<770::aid-cncr2820651323>3.0.co;2-8.,['2R01CA-22849/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,101,,

Advances and prospectus.,689-95,"During the past decade, advances in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have continued, largely due to improved disease-free survival of poor-prognosis subgroups, improved sanctuary therapy, shortening of therapy duration, and salvage of relapsed patients with better chemotherapy regimens and with bone marrow transplantation. Nonetheless, more children continue to die of ALL than of any other childhood cancer. This review outlines central issues in the staging and treatment of ALL that should be addressed if the cure rate in childhood ALL is to be significantly improved. Present dilemmas in the staging of ALL include the following: lack of standardization of staging systems; complicated algorithms; variable application and interpretation of multivariate analyses; dynamic interactions between prognostic front end variables and subsequent treatment; ambiguity of prognostic factors that are predictive of outcome but biologically inexplicable; unsuccessful attempts to define a good-prognosis subgroup for the purpose of streamlining therapy to a minimum; and the interface between ALL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloid leukemias. The remaining therapeutic problems include a lack of reliable in vitro tests of chemosensitivity and chemoresistance, inability to quantitate residual leukemia after remission induction or to detect drug-resistant clones of cells before they are clinically manifest, and delivery of optimum therapy and supportive care to all children with ALL.","['Bleyer, W A']",['Bleyer WA'],"['American Cancer Society, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19900201)65:3+<689::aid-cncr2820651312>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Feb 1;65(3 Suppl):689-95. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900201)65:3+<689::aid-cncr2820651312>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,51,,

Two subclones from the human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line were unable to digest bacterial DNA unless they were previously induced to mature by incubation for several days with 1.25% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The maximal capacity of DMSO-induced HL-60 cells to digest DNA was similar to that of monocytes purified from peripheral blood (PB) and much greater than that of neutrophils. The increasing capacity to digest DNA during maturation was associated with the development of acid DNAse activity, measured in a cell-free system, and slightly preceded development of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate-stimulated respiratory burst activity. The acid DNAse had a pH optimum of 5.0 and did not require the presence of calcium or 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). A third subclone of HL-60 cells was able to digest DNA from intact bacteria without previous maturation, however, and this was associated with the presence of an alkaline DNAse which had a pH optimum between 7.0 and 8.0 and showed a dependence on calcium and 2-ME for maximal activity. The subcellular location of acid DNAse in DMSO-induced HL-60 cells was similar to that of monocytes in having a bimodal distribution on fractionated sucrose density gradients. The dense peak (mean density 1.195 g/mL) was located in the same region of the gradient as primary granule enzymes but the light peak (mean density 1.137 g/mL) did not codistribute with either plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, or mitochondria, suggesting accumulation in a different organelle.","['Roberts, P J']",['Roberts PJ'],"['Department of Clinical Haematology, University College, London, England.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Fractionation', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleases/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Monocytes/analysis/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Phagocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Subcellular Fractions/*enzymology']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85724-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 15;75(4):976-83.,,,,,,,,

A modification of the polymerase chain reaction can be used in patients to detect low levels of the BCR-ABL-encoded mRNA transcript, a specific marker for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Early detection of relapse after bone marrow transplantation could potentially alter treatment decisions. We prospectively evaluated 19 patients for evidence of molecular relapse, cytogenetic relapse, and clinical relapse after bone marrow transplantation. We used the polymerase chain reaction to detect residual BCR-ABL mRNA in patients followed up to 45 months after treatment (median, 15 months; range, 6-45 months) and found 4 patients with BCR-ABL mRNA expression following bone marrow transplantation. In 2 patients BCR-ABL mRNA was detected in all samples, and both have developed cytogenetic relapse. In 1 patient BCR-ABL mRNA was detected transiently during the first month after transplant but was undetectable thereafter. The fourth patient had BCR-ABL mRNA 6 months after bone marrow transplantation but not in prior samples. Fifteen patients did not express detectable BCR-ABL mRNA.

A plasmid containing a murine c-myb cDNA controlled by a mouse metallothionein I promoter was transfected into the C19 MEL cell line. For six transfected clones, it was found that expression of the exogenous c-myb mRNA could be up-regulated by the addition of 120 microM ZnCl2 and that the N,N'-hexamethylenebisacetamide-induced differentiation of these transfectants was inhibited in proportion to the level of exogenous c-myb mRNA expression. By adding or removing ZnCl2 at different times during the induction process, it was possible to show that up-regulation of exogenous c-myb limited to the first 2 days of induction had little or no effect on differentiation. In contrast, continuous expression of exogenous c-myb beginning at any time during the period of induction blocked further differentiation. These results suggest that during HMBA induction of MEL cells, the early down-regulation of c-myb mRNA is not necessary for terminal differentiation, whereas the down-regulation of c-myb at a later time is necessary.","['McClinton, D', 'Stafford, J', 'Brents, L', 'Bender, T P', 'Kuehl, W M']","['McClinton D', 'Stafford J', 'Brents L', 'Bender TP', 'Kuehl WM']","['NCI-Navy Medical Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20814.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Metallothionein/genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transfection', 'Zinc/pharmacology', '*Zinc Compounds']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.10.2.705-710.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Feb;10(2):705-10. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.2.705-710.1990.,,PMC360869,,,,,,

We assessed the comparative values of auto-BMT and allogeneic marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) in 117 15- to 60-year-old consecutive patients (median, 43 years) with AML following remission-induction therapy. In 32 cases of the 90 (77%) complete responders, auto-BMT (nonpurged) was undertaken at a median of 3.8 months and in 23 eligible cases human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allo-BMT occurred at 3.0 months after attainment of remission. Thus, nearly 60% of complete responders had access to transplantation, the others being withdrawn because of relapse, refusal, or other causes. Median time of regeneration to neutrophils 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelets 20 x 10(9)/L were 39 and 63 days following auto-BMT versus 21 and 19 days after allo-BMT, respectively. AML relapse was the predominant cause of failure after auto-BMT (17 of 32) and procedure-related death was seen in three of 32 patients. The actuarial rates of relapse at 3 years are 60% (auto-BMT) and 34% (allo-BMT) (log-rank, P = .03). Patients treated with auto-BMT and allo-BMT have an overall survival of 37% and 66% at 3 years posttransplant, respectively (P = .05). Relapse-free 3-year survival rates are 35% and 51%, respectively (P = .12). Survival of the nongrafted complete responders is less than 10%.

Immunological analysis involved standard fluorescence flow cytometry and utilized 31 monoclonal antibodies to known myeloid antigens (of CD groups 11b, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 16, w17, 31, w32, 33, 34, 35 and 36), a number of relatively less well studied antibodies with potential specificity for AML, and a series of control antibodies to T and B lymphocytes, platelets, erythrocytes and of widespread distribution (CD45, leucocyte common; HLA-DR). The results highlighted a number of antibodies with wide myeloid reactivity, in addition to CD13 and 33 (present in 66 per cent and 76 per cent of cases, respectively), which may be of immunodiagnostic use. A number of correlations between AML cell immunophenotype and FAB morphology subtype were found; in particular five antibodies (CD11c, 10.1, Tu3, CD15 and CD16), of both predominant granulocytic and monocytic reactivity, reacted with cells of AML-M5 subtype (p less than 0.05). There was no significant correlation between immunophenotype and clinical and pathological features at presentation. Correlation with clinical outcome was not a prominent feature, in contrast to some reports based on multicentre data. However, of particular note was the strong association between early death (at less than 2 months) and the coexpression of Leucocyte Function Associated (LFA) antigens, CD11b and 11c, on patient's blast cells (p = 0.003). The relationship was independent of clinical features and persisted even if AML-M5 cases were excluded. The significance of this latter finding is unclear, but may be related to the known role of CD11b and 11c LFA antigens in the cellular response to infection.","['Tucker, J', 'Dorey, E', 'Gregory, W M', 'Simpson, A P', 'Amess, J A', 'Lister, T A', 'Horton, M A']","['Tucker J', 'Dorey E', 'Gregory WM', 'Simpson AP', 'Amess JA', 'Lister TA', 'Horton MA']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion/analysis', 'Survival Analysis']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900080107 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1990 Jan-Feb;8(1):47-58. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900080107.,,,,,,,,

The human T cell leukemia viruses types I (HTLV-I) and II (HTLV-II), the prototypic human-type C retroviruses, have been identified as the causative agents of some forms of human leukemia and neurological disorders. The genetic structure and regulation of the HTLVs are more complex than their avian and murine leukemia virus counterparts. In addition to the gag, pol, and env genes that encode the characteristic virion proteins of all replication competent retroviruses, the genomes of HTLV encode the non-structural proteins, Tax and Rex, which are required for regulating viral gene expression. To understand what appears to be a complex mechanism of disease induction by HTLV, elucidating the regulation and function of the viral gene products and the interaction of these products with each other, as well as with cellular factors, will be critical. This review focuses primarily on regulation of HTLV gene expression in the infected human T lymphocyte, but also discusses analogous gene regulation by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It concentrates specifically on the role these gene products play in virus replication and, ultimately, pathogenesis.","['Green, P L', 'Chen, I S']","['Green PL', 'Chen IS']","['Department of Microbiology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex', 'Gene Products, tax', 'Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae Proteins/physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.4.2.2404818 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1990 Feb 1;4(2):169-75. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.4.2.2404818.,,,,,,40,,

TfR and c-myc cDNA probes hybridized equally to RNA from uninduced cells in all phases of the cell cycle. However, after 24 h incubation with the differentiation inducer retinoic acid, TfR mRNA was expressed substantially less in the G1 stage, whereas c-myc mRNA was still expressed equally in all cell cycle phases.

We have developed an immunocytochemical procedure for human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in order to assess its level and subcellular distribution in a well-studied system of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CEM), where sensitive and resistant subclones have been established. Several fixation and cell permeabilization protocols were compared. The most sensitive and reproducible one for light microscopy was prefixation in Bouin's solution followed by cytocentrifugation. Using various polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, the GR was consistently localized predominantly in the cell cytoplasm in the absence of steroid. We compared localization of GR following glucocorticoid treatment in the glucocorticoid-sensitive clone CEM C7 with resistant subclones (4R4, 3R43, ICR27). Upon incubation with glucocorticoid, an increase in nuclear staining was clearly observed in the steroid-sensitive C7 cells. Although the resistant cell lines contain immunoreactive GR, they failed to show nuclear translocation following glucocorticoid treatment.

Retreatment after 10 days without rhGM-CSF resulted in a more marked leukocytosis at doses greater than or equal to 10 micrograms/kg/day. Platelet levels decreased for the first 3 days and then increased during the first course of rhGM-CSF administration. Two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had a transient reduction in lymphocytosis. Serum cholesterol and albumin levels decreased, and vitamin B12 levels increased during rhGM-CSF treatment. At doses of up to 15 micrograms/kg/day, rhGM-CSF was relatively well tolerated by the patients, but adverse effects included bone pain, lethargy, fever, rash, and weight gain. A first dose reaction characterized by hypoxia and hypotension was identified at dose levels greater than or equal to 1 microgram/kg. Dosing i.v. was less potent at inducing a leukocytosis than previously observed for equivalent s.c. doses and was associated with a higher incidence of generalized rash and first dose reactions. The maximal tolerated dose of i.v. rhGM-CSF was 15 micrograms/kg/day. Phase II studies in which the derived effect is to raise leukocyte levels should be undertaken at rhGM-CSF doses of 3 to 15 micrograms/kg/day.","['Lieschke, G J', 'Maher, D', ""O'Connor, M"", 'Green, M', 'Sheridan, W', 'Rallings, M', 'Bonnem, E', 'Burgess, A W', 'McGrath, K', 'Fox, R M']","['Lieschke GJ', 'Maher D', ""O'Connor M"", 'Green M', 'Sheridan W', 'Rallings M', 'Bonnem E', 'Burgess AW', 'McGrath K', 'Fox RM', 'et al.']","['Clinical Research Program, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Basophils', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Eosinophils', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Lipids/blood', 'Lymphocytes', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neutrophils', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Feb 1;50(3):606-14.,,,,,,,,

An 18-year experience and postmortem review.,1041-7,"A review of pediatric autopsy results at the Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine from 1970 through 1987 was conducted. Thirty-three cases of typhlitis were identified in patients with acute leukemia and two cases each in patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma and aplastic anemia. Patients ranged in age from 10 months to 17 years. Fifty-seven percent were male and 43% were female. All were myelosuppressed. A postmortem incidence rate of 24% was determined for patients with acute leukemia. Common symptoms included abdominal pain and distention in 78% of patients and acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in 35%. Abdominal radiographs varied in spectrum from a nonspecific bowel gas pattern to frank right colonic pneumatosis intestinalis. Thirty-three patients received chemotherapy within 30 days before onset of abdominal symptoms. All patients were febrile (greater than 38.5 degrees C), and 33 received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Three patients received amphotericin B. Premortem, 84% of organisms cultured from blood were bacterial whereas 16% were fungal. Fungal pathogens accounted for 53% of new microorganisms seen at autopsy. Postmortem examination showed typhlitis in the following anatomic distributions: (1) confined to the cecum; (2) involving the cecum and ileum; (3) involving the cecum, ileum, and ascending colon; or (4) involving the cecum, with sporadic ulcers throughout the intestine.

Several groups have reported the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a highly sensitive technique for detecting residual leukaemia, to study blood and bone marrow of patients in apparent cytogenetic and clinical remission at various intervals after BMT. The limitations of the technique relate to the need in CML to use mRNA rather than DNA as test material, the undefined sensitivity of the assay, the lack of knowledge of cell lineage when the test is positive and the high risk with present techniques of false positive and false negative findings. These points notwithstanding, the collected data suggest that most longterm survivors have no evidence of leukaemia detectable by PCR; in contrast many of the patients transplanted within the last 5 years do have evidence of residual leukaemia. This suggests that in a significant number of patients the leukaemic clone may survive for several years after BMT before it is eradicated (or falls below the threshold for detection by PCR). If this is confirmed the finding of residual leukaemia by PCR in the first few years post-BMT would have limited prognostic significance.","['Hughes, T P', 'Goldman, J M']","['Hughes TP', 'Goldman JM']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Gene Amplification', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/*surgery/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/transplantation']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Jan;5(1):3-6.,,,,,,19,,

Well-developed intercellular bridges and eosinophilic cytoplasm were seen within the metaplastic cells; apoptoses and occasional mitoses were present. This process is distinct and probably occurred secondary to direct toxic injury from the chemotherapeutic drugs.

In non-clinical experiments, the effect of epirubicin on transplantable murine tumors was similar or superior to that of doxorubicin in rats and mice. As for pharmacodynamics, this drug was found to rapidly penetrate into the tissue from the blood, and to remain there for a long period of time. This drug has been widely used abroad for the treatment of various solid cancers, such as breast cancer, and tumors of hematopoietic organs, such as malignant lymphoma. In Japan, it was proved clinically that the drug was effective on a wide range of tumors, including acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, hepatic cancer and ureteral epithelioma(bladder cancer, renal cancer and ureteral cancer). In a comparative study of chronic cardiotoxicity, it was noted that epirubicin produced less damage to the myocardium than doxorubicin when every morphological change was examined as an indicator. Electrocardiographic and histopathological findings also disclosed that epirubicin exhibited a smaller effect on the myocardium than that of doxorubicin. In conclusion, epirubicin is a new antitumor agent having an antitumor effect similar or superior to that of doxorubicin with the various toxicities, including cardiotoxicity, which are reduced in this drug in comparison to those of doxorubicin.","['Tsukagoshi, S']",['Tsukagoshi S'],"['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Jap.

DATA IDENTIFICATION: English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1982 to 89), review of meeting reports, and extensive hand searching of bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: All identified articles. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality and specific descriptive information concerning population, intervention, and outcome measurements were assessed. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: There have been few controlled, randomized trials of intravenous immunoglobulin. Available data suggest efficacy in persons with primary immune deficiency, premature infants at risk for group B streptococcus infection, patients with Kawasaki disease, transplant recipients at risk for cytomegalovirus infection, patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and selected patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Data are also favorable concerning the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in some other autoimmune disorders, but randomized trials are needed. Interesting areas for future study include the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), multiple myeloma, and lymphomas. Risks of intravenous immunoglobulin are minimal. CONCLUSION: Intravenous immunoglobulin is safe and effective in treating several human diseases. Additional randomized trials are needed.","['Berkman, S A', 'Lee, M L', 'Gale, R P']","['Berkman SA', 'Lee ML', 'Gale RP']",['UCLA School of Medicine.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],IM,"['Bacterial Infections/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/therapy', '*Immunization, Passive/adverse effects', 'Immunoglobulin G/adverse effects/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Virus Diseases/therapy']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-112-4-278 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1990 Feb 15;112(4):278-92. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-112-4-278.,,,['Ann Intern Med 1990 Jun 15;112(12):967'],,,224,['Ann Intern Med. 1990 Dec 1;113(11):897-8.

At low cell density in suspension culture and in a clonogenic assay, blast cell growth was stimulated by recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) independently. The response to rIL-1 was inhibited (less than 90%) by anti-GM-CSF, suggesting that the proliferative response to IL-1 was mediated by GM-CSF. This was supported by experiments which demonstrated that blast cell conditioned medium prepared in the presence of IL-1 contained GM-CSF activity which stimulated the growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage precursors (CFU-GM) and of homologous GM-CSF responsive AML blasts. As IL-1 but no GM-CSF activity was detected in BCCM prepared without exogenous IL-1 and a neutralizing antibody to IL-1 inhibited the autonomous growth of blasts in suspension culture, we conclude that the endogenous secretion of IL-1 by leukemic cells stimulated autocrine GM-CSF secretion, inducing autonomous growth of the blast cell population.","['Bradbury, D', 'Bowen, G', 'Kozlowski, R', 'Reilly, I', 'Russell, N']","['Bradbury D', 'Bowen G', 'Kozlowski R', 'Reilly I', 'Russell N']","['University Department of Haematology City Hospital, Nottingham, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Jan;4(1):44-7.,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, we have encountered 11 patients who lacked the Ph translocation, bcr rearrangement, and (in the four patients with available mRNA) a bcr-abl message, and yet had a disease phenotype at diagnosis that was a morphologic facsimile of classic chronic phase CML. These patients presented with high white blood cell counts, neutrophilia, occasional basophilia, splenomegaly, and a hypercellular bone marrow with granulocytic hyperplasia and a left shift in myeloid maturation. Despite the striking resemblance between the early stages of bcr-negative and bcr-positive CML, disease progression manifests distinctly in these two disorders. In contrast to the blastic transformation that inevitably complicates bcr-positive CML, the natural history of our 11 Ph-negative, bcr-negative CML patients was characterized by increasing leukemia burden with leukocytosis, pronounced organomegaly, extramedullary infiltrates, and eventual bone marrow failure (anemia and thrombocytopenia) without marked increases in blast cells. Our current observations suggest that a chronic myeloid leukemia process can develop without associated changes in the bcr or c-abl genes. Although the initial phase of this disease is indistinguishable from CML, the presence or absence of molecular markers may aid in the prediction of the clinical course of Ph-negative CML.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Shtalrid, M', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kurzrock R', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Shtalrid M', 'Gutterman JU', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, UT M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Probes', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",1990/01/15 00:00,1990/01/15 00:01,['1990/01/15 00:00'],"['1990/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85793-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jan 15;75(2):445-52.,,,,,,,,

Within the 17-kilobase (kb) pair locus surrounding the truncated GM-CSF gene remnant, there are no fewer than four rearranged genomic fragments that seemingly derive from chromosome 5 region q21----23. Two of the fragments, which flank the truncated GM-CSF locus on the 5q-, are contiguous on the normal chromosome 5, centrometric to the normal GM-CSF allele, indicating at least one intrachromosomal insertion event, either preceded or followed by further deletion. Insertion and/or deletion was accompanied by juxtaposition of LINE sequences to the 5' side of the truncated GM-CSF locus within the inserted fragment. The entire rearranged locus is embedded in repetitive sequences, which may have mediated successive insertions or deletions. The extent of such stepwise deletions, resulting in loss of genes such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, IL-5, and GM-CSF, whose gene products are critical to differentiation within the lineage of the affected hematopoietic stem cell, may be mirrored in the heterogeneity of symptoms and 5q- deletion sizes observed in myelodysplasias and acute leukemias carrying a 5q- chromosome. Perhaps most significantly, the sequences surrounding the insertion/deletion region are suggestive of recombination signals, including direct repeats and mirrored repeats. The site of insertion of the GM-CSF 3' region into an upstream (centromeric) locus is flanked by direct repeats; the upstream site into which it is inserted is also flanked by 12 base pair (bp) direct repeats. After insertion, one member of each pair of repeats is lost. The organization of this rearranged locus implies that direct repeats had a role in the intrachromosomal recombination/deletion event.","['Nagarajan, L', 'Lange, B', 'Cannizzaro, L', 'Finan, J', 'Nowell, P C', 'Huebner, K']","['Nagarajan L', 'Lange B', 'Cannizzaro L', 'Finan J', 'Nowell PC', 'Huebner K']","['Department of Hematology, M.

Increasing the radiation dose shortened the preleukemic latent period, and in female mice the frequency of leukemia development was higher and the latent period shorter than in male mice. In the preleukemic period, the injected FDC-P1 cells rapidly increased in number in hematopoietic organs of irradiated animals, reaching peak levels 3 to 5 weeks after injection; factor-independent transformed cells were not detected before day 45. In unirradiated animals, these events were delayed by several weeks, and long-term survivors did not harbor detectable FDC-P1 cells. FDC-P1 cells sampled from preleukemic mice frequently showed atypical colony formation and reduced cloning efficiency in vitro, suggesting the occurrence of a distinct preleukemic change. U16.6 cells produced leukemia only in irradiated recipients, and the leukemic cells usually remained factor dependent.

The idiotypic Ig is molecularly defined and the behavior of the target cells placed under anti-idiotypic attack might have broader implications for cancer immunotherapy. Simple administration of monoclonal antibody reactive with these determinants clearly has only a limited effect on tumor load, due largely to the multiplicity of strategies by which the tumor cell can avoid such attack. These include modulation, change in idiotypic determinants due to somatic mutation, and complete loss of expression at the cell surface. If the first antibody treatment can be made more effective, for example by tailoring molecules to recruit available effector mechanisms more efficiently, or by the use of antibodies capable of delivering a lethal hit via a toxin, the tumor cell will presumably have less opportunity to escape. A second strategy is to immunize the tumor-bearing host with idiotypic Ig obtained from tumor cells. Once in place, such an immune response should suppress tumor growth on a continuing basis. In animal lymphoma, this approach appears to prolong survival although some of the escape mechanisms encountered for passive antibody therapy are apparently operative for active therapy. Study of these mechanisms should allow insight into how cells control expression of idiotypic determinants at the cell surface and open the possibility of further therapeutic intervention. A combined approach to the treatment of human lymphoma might be envisaged whereby tumor load is reduced by passive antibody, thus leaving the immune system relatively unscathed, and even perhaps releasing natural antitumor responses which could be further stimulated by immunization.","['Stevenson, F K', 'George, A J', 'Glennie, M J']","['Stevenson FK', 'George AJ', 'Glennie MJ']","['Tenovus Research Laboratory, General Hospital, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Chem Immunol,Chemical immunology,9001090,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Plasmacytoma/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chem Immunol. 1990;48:126-66.,,,,,,108,,

Diagnostic utility of commercially obtained 4KB5 and UCHL-1.,58-69,"Although many recent studies have begun exploring the diagnostic utility of anti-B- and anti-T-cell antibodies that work on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, the most optimal panel to use remains uncertain. In addition, many of the published reports have used antibodies obtained before their commercial formulation and distribution. For these reasons, B5-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 174 reactive or neoplastic lymphoid and hematopoietic proliferations were immunostained with the commercially obtained antibodies 4KB5, UCHL-1, and, in selected cases, L26. In reactive nodes, 4KB5 stained B-cell areas and UCHL-1 T-cell areas. Seventy-nine percent of the B-cell neoplasms were 4KB5 positive, and only 2% were UCHL-1 positive. Two cases of myeloma were 4KB5 and UCHL-1 negative. The 4KB5-negative B-cell lymphomas (ML-B) were all L-26 positive. UCHL-1 stained 78% of the T-cell lymphomas (ML-T), and 4KB5 stained 14%. In the five 4KB5-positive putative T-cell lymphomas, immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies were performed. In Hodgkin's disease (HD), Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells were UCHL-1 negative in 75% of cases and occasionally positive in 25%. Definite 4KB5 positivity of RS cells was identified in both cases of lymphocyte predominant HD and in one case of nodular sclerosing HD with monomorphic large cell areas. With the exception of 1 of 15 acute nonlymphocytic leukemias that was UCHL-1 positive, all acute leukemias were 4KB5 and UCHL-1 negative. In summary, commercially obtained 4KB5 and UCHL-1 form a useful but not absolutely specific or sensitive paraffin section immunoperoxidase panel for the categorization of B- and T-cell lymphoid neoplasms. Addition of L26 appears to add to the sensitivity and specificity of the panel. Definite immunophenotypic distinction of HD from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, particularly of T-cell type, often was not possible.","['Clark, J R', 'Williams, M E', 'Swerdlow, S H']","['Clark JR', 'Williams ME', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Sarcoma/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/93.1.58 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1990 Jan;93(1):58-69. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/93.1.58.,,,,,,,,

The automated method uses the shearing action of fluid movement generated by a reciprocating paddle system. When compared on 11 samples, the automated instrument always isolated cells in less time, usually requiring only 15-30 seconds in contrast to 10-15 minutes for the manual method. The time comparisons involved ""set up"" time of the required minor equipment as well as the time to make a complete single cell suspension from the portion of the biopsy sample sent to the Flow Cytometry Lab so extra cells could be used for other purposes and cryogenically stored for future reference. Cells isolated by the automated method from various B-lymphocytic and T-lymphocytic malignancies were still viable and could be successfully immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. The immunophenotyping results were compared for both cell isolation methods on seven of these samples, and the results were comparable. The automated technique has now been used to satisfactorily immunophenotype more than 50 biopsy samples. The automated method should represent a significant aid for clinical flow cytometry laboratories performing immunophenotyping tests by efficiently preparing single cell suspensions in a few seconds instead of minutes. Furthermore, the automated method uses a closed sterile bag system that helps minimize the exposure of personnel to potential infectious material present in biopsy samples and prevents external contamination of cell suspensions. The automated technique proven successful for immunophenotyping may also be helpful for related procedures involving hematopoietic malignancies such as DNA content analysis and cell functional assays by flow cytometry, as well as other assays such as tissue typing, gene probe, and in vitro chemosensitivity assays.","['Warzynski, M J', 'Podgurski, A E', 'Boldt, D M', 'Otto, R N']","['Warzynski MJ', 'Podgurski AE', 'Boldt DM', 'Otto RN']","['Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts 01199.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', '*Autoanalysis', 'Biopsy', '*Cytological Techniques', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', '*Phenotype']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/93.1.104 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1990 Jan;93(1):104-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/93.1.104.,,,,,,,,

For each case patient with leukemia, three matched controls were chosen who had been treated for Hodgkin's disease but in whom leukemia did not develop. The use of chemotherapy alone to treat Hodgkin's disease was associated with a relative risk of leukemia of 9.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.1 to 20) as compared with the use of radiotherapy alone. Patients treated with both had a relative risk of 7.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.9 to 15). After treatment with more than six cycles of combinations including procarbazine and mechlorethamine, the risk of leukemia was 14-fold higher than after radiotherapy alone. The use of radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy did not increase the risk of leukemia above that produced by the use of chemotherapy alone, but there was a dose-related increase in the risk of leukemia in patients who received radiotherapy alone. The peak in the risk of leukemia came about five years after chemotherapy began, and a large excess persisted for at least eight years after it ended. After adjusting for drug regimen, we found that patients who had undergone splenectomy had at least double the risk of leukemia of patients who had not, and an advanced stage of Hodgkin's disease carried a somewhat higher risk of leukemia than Stage I disease. We conclude that chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease greatly increases the risk of leukemia and that this increased risk appears to be dose-related and unaffected by concomitant radiotherapy. In addition, the risk is greater for patients with more advanced stages of Hodgkin's disease and for those who undergo splenectomy.","['Kaldor, J M', 'Day, N E', 'Clarke, E A', 'Van Leeuwen, F E', 'Henry-Amar, M', 'Fiorentino, M V', 'Bell, J', 'Pedersen, D', 'Band, P', 'Assouline, D']","['Kaldor JM', 'Day NE', 'Clarke EA', 'Van Leeuwen FE', 'Henry-Amar M', 'Fiorentino MV', 'Bell J', 'Pedersen D', 'Band P', 'Assouline D', 'et al.']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenectomy/adverse effects']",1990/01/04 00:00,1990/01/04 00:01,['1990/01/04 00:00'],"['1990/01/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/04 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199001043220102 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1990 Jan 4;322(1):7-13. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199001043220102.,,,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1990 Jan 4;322(1):52-3.

We have used an in vitro transformation assay system to determine directly whether the HTLV-I tax gene has transformation potential. Transfection of the tax gene alone into early-passage rat embryo fibroblasts did not induce morphological alterations. However, cotransfection of tax with the selectable marker plasmid pRSVneo gave rise to G418-resistant colonies that could be established as immortalized cell lines. Cotransfection of tax with the ras oncogene into rat embryo fibroblasts gave rise to foci of transformed cells that were highly tumorigenic in nude mice.

There are mainly two clusters of nuclear factor-binding sites in the zeta promoter. The proximal cluster spans the DNA sequence from -110 to -60 and consists of binding sites for CP2, Sp1, and NF-E1. NF-E1 binding is K562 specific, whereas CP2 binding is common to both types of cells. Overlapping the NF-E1- and CP2-binding sites is a hidden Sp1-binding site or CAC box, as demonstrated by binding studies of affinity-purified Sp1. In the distal promoter region at -250 to -220, another NF-E1-binding site overlaps a CAC box or Sp1-binding site. Extract-mixing experiments demonstrated that the higher affinity of NF-E1 binding excluded the binding of Sp1 in the K562 extract. NF-E1 factors could also displace prebound Sp1 molecules. Between the two clusters of multiple-factor-binding sites are sequences recognized by other factors, including zeta-globin factors 1 and 2, that are present in both HeLa and K562 extracts.

Animal models are, therefore, indispensable for gaining insight into the characteristics of leukemia growth during the MRD phase.

The BNML model exhibited a high degree of similarity to human AML with regard to its general growth characteristics, its cell kinetic parameters, its biophysical parameters and its response to chemotherapy. This implied that studies of the BNML model have predictive value for clinical application. In the BNML model a number of independent methods are available to quantify the number of leukemic cells, i.e., indirectly by means of various bioassays or directly by using monoclonal antibody labeling and flow cytometry. Studies of the BNML model in relation to the understanding of various aspects of MRD in leukemia are discussed in this concise review.

The neoplasms are, at least in part, associated with insertional mutagenesis of the c-myb locus. Evidence is presented for the existence of at least two genetic elements of the virus that are crucial to induction of this disease but are not required for viral replication in hematopoietic tissues or induction of lymphoid disease. These genetic elements were detected by testing the pathogenicity of recombinants between Moloney and Friend MuLVs, the latter of which is nonleukemic to myeloid cells under these conditions, and by testing Moloney MuLV-based viruses that have nonretroviral sequences inserted at specific endonuclease sites in their long terminal repeats (LTRs). Analysis of the Moloney/Friend recombinants showed that there are sequences within the structural gene domain of Moloney, but not Friend, MuLV that are necessary for promonocytic leukemia, whereas the LTRs of the MuLVs are equally effective for promonocytic tumor formation and insertional mutagenesis of the c-myb gene. Experiments with viruses which were mutagenized in the LTR by insertions demonstrated that there is a specific genetic element in the U3 region of the LTR of Moloney MuLV, upstream of the 75-base-pair enhancer which, when interrupted, results in loss of leukemogenicity for cells in the monocytic lineage but not cells in the lymphoid lineage.

All patients had transient HIV-1 antigenemia documented before antibody was detected. One patient died of Kaposi's sarcoma 2 years posttransplantion with a functioning graft. One is alive and asymptomatic 4 years posttransplant, and two rejected their grafts and are asymptomatic on maintenance hemodialysis. Six patients tested positive for HTLV-I by EIA. Only two patients, however, were also positive for HTLV-I by Western blot, RIPA, and p24 antigen RIA, one prior to and one after transplantation.

Utilizing an indirect immunofluorescence assays with a monoclonal antibody to GD3(R24), pretreatment leukemic lymphoblasts from 80 children with ALL were assayed for GD3 expression. GD3 was observed in 75% of leukemic samples in which lymphoblasts exhibited a T-cell phenotype, whereas none of the 33 non-T-ALL samples tested exhibited GD3. Correlation between the expression of GD3 and various antigenic determinants of T-cell differentiation was restricted to CD2; 75% of CD2-negative T-cell ALL blasts failed to express GD3. Anti-GD3 immunoreactivity to T-ALL samples was not restricted to R24 in that two other monoclonal anti-GD3 antibodies were similarly reactive to T-ALL blasts. In vitro incubation of T-cell lymphoblasts with the anti-GD3 antibodies, R24 and C281 and human serum resulted in significant cytotoxicity, and R24 also mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by normal effector cells. Cytotoxicity was specific for those T-ALL blast cell populations which reacted with anti-GD3 as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Since immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibody to GD3 was exclusively observed in a large population of immunophenotypically defined T-cell leukemic lymphoblasts, these studies suggest a possible immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic potential for anti-GD3 monoclonal antibodies in T-cell lymphoblastic malignancies.","['Reaman, G H', 'Taylor, B J', 'Merritt, W D']","['Reaman GH', 'Taylor BJ', 'Merritt WD']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '62010-37-1 (ganglioside, GD3)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Child', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gangliosides/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jan 1;50(1):202-5.,['CA-03888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

A recent retrospective analysis has suggested that administration of the drug in the evening results in a better prognosis. We compared the disposition pharmacokinetics of mercaptopurine administered in the morning vs in the evening in 13 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Elimination half-life of mercaptopurine was significantly longer in the evening than during the day (423 +/- 142 minutes vs 176 +/- 22 minutes, mean +/- SEM). The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) was significantly larger in the evening (24,713 +/- 3536 ng/mL per minute vs 17,120 +/- 1474 ng/mL per minute). These differences were even more pronounced when comparing the area under the curve of the postdistributive phase (AUC300 min-infinity, 7724 +/- 2955 ng/mL per minute in the evening vs 2597 +/- 712 ng/mL per minute during the day). In a second study, 12 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving mercaptopurine in the morning had their medication administration switched to the evening. Within 2 weeks there was a sharp fall in peripheral white blood cell counts in all patients (from 4.1 x 10(9)/L to 2.2 x 10(9)/L) mainly due to a drop in polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (from 2.78 x 10(9)/L to 1.05 x 10(9)/L).

The clone has a 741-base pair open reading frame encoding a putative 246-amino acid protein. The protein sequence contains the catalytic charge relay system characteristic of a serine protease and the conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature cytotoxic lymphocyte serine proteases found in both mouse and human. The amino acid sequence of CSP-C has 71% identity with the previously reported cytotoxic serine protease-B(CSP-B)/human lymphocyte protease (HLP)/SECT and 57% identity with the granulocyte-specific serine protease cathepsin G. The homology with another lymphocyte-specific serine protease, human Hanukah factor (HF)/Granzyme A was 41%. The transcript is expressed in lymphocytes stimulated with IL-2 or IL-2 plus phytohemagglutinin (PHA). CSP-C is not expressed in B-lymphoblastoid cell lines or in the T-leukemia cell line MOLT4. The cDNA sequence suggests that the protein is expressed as a prepropeptide, as has been found in the other murine and human serine proteases of lymphocyte origin. It has recently been reported that human chromosome 14q11, in addition to containing the genes encoding cytotoxic serine protease B (CSP-B), cathepsin G, and the T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes, also includes an additional genomic DNA clone which cross-hybridized with CSP-B and cathepsin G, cathepsin-like gene-2 (CGL-2).

Data from the MHI suggests that adolescent cancer survivors do experience more global psychological distress than a comparison group of healthy adolescents. In addition, the majority of these patients reported persistent, intrusive thoughts about their illness and its treatment. Conversely, the adolescent cancer survivors did not differ from a normative sample on social competence, manifestation of problems behaviors, or school achievement. Thus, our data suggest that adjustment in this population is multi-dimensional with variability. While they are functioning quite adequately at school and in social situation, they continue to experience heightened and persistent distress of both a global and illness-specific quality. A number of factors that are conducive to psychosocial intervention appear to be related to adjustment. Family communication and family cohesion were significantly related to the mental health of the adolescent survivors, suggesting a need to further explore the family context of adolescent adjustment. The present work also represents the first attempt to directly examine the psychosocial functioning of young adult, acute leukemia survivors. When compared with normative samples of nonpatients, these survivors (taken as a whole group), reported heightened levels on several indicators of psychological distress. While not entirely consistent across different psychological measures, these young people were generally one standard deviation above the mean for psychological distress. But when compared to normative samples of psychiatric outpatients, our survivors reported significantly less psychological distress. For instance, leukemia survivors reported less intrusive and avoidant cognitions associated with the stressor of being diagnosed and treated for cancer than those associated with patients experiencing traumatic stress disorders. In aggregate, these findings again suggest that the psychosocial adjustment of leukemia survivors is quite variable. Finally, while group comparisons shed light on the psychosocial functioning of leukemia survivors, in general, wide variability in psychosocial adjustment may mask identification of a cohort of cancer survivors most at-risk for psychosocial dysfunction. Sociodemographic, disease/treatment and psychological distress variables only partially explain this variability. The findings from our data suggest several clinical recommendations.

By preventing recruitment, pEEDCK can keep hemopoietic stem cells in their normal nonproliferative state and in this way prevent damage by certain cell cycle-specific cytostatic drugs. pEEDCK could play a role as hemoprotector in tumor chemotherapy. As a thiol-containing peptide, pEEDCK is highly sensitive to oxidation, resulting in the formation of a dimer. Although monomeric pEEDCK is a strong inhibitor of colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) clonal growth, the dimer was previously found to enhance colony-stimulating factor-triggered CFU-GM colony formation. It seemed, thus, necessary to find methods that avoid undesired dimerization reactions. A solid phase strategy for pEEDCK synthesis is presented. The primary synthetic product, S-tert-butyl-sulfenyl-pEEDCK, was purified and stored with the thiol-protecting group remaining attached. Conversion to active monomeric pEEDCK was achieved by reductive treatment in situ before application and removal of tert-butyl-mercaptane in vacuo. The activation reagent (dithioerythritol) prevented reoxidation also in culture media, where unprotected peptide was oxidized rapidly (t1/2 less than 13 min). The purified synthetic peptide was found to be a potent inhibitor of CFU-GM colony formation (IC50 = 1.1 x 10(-12) M) in vitro. It was also found to inhibit colony formation of some leukemic cell lines (HL-60, RAJI) although at much higher concentrations (10(-8) to 10(-9) M). Friend leukemia cells were not inhibited in the dose range where CFU-GM were sensitive.","['Paukovits, W R', 'Hergl, A', 'Schulte-Hermann, R']","['Paukovits WR', 'Hergl A', 'Schulte-Hermann R']","['Department of Growth Regulation, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,['0 (Oligopeptides)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Stability', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1990 Sep;38(3):401-9.,,,,,,,,

Selection of the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach is often difficult, and in part depends on the risk-to-benefit ratio of various diagnostic modalities, such as bronchoscopy, bronchioalveolar lavage, percutaneous needle biopsy, and open-lung biopsy (OLB). We reviewed our experience with OLB and bronchoscopy in a predominantly pediatric bone marrow transplantation population, and attempted to assess the frequency with which OLB results directed a therapeutic change, as well as the clinical results of any such therapeutic alteration. A retrospective chart review was conducted of 87 bone marrow transplantation recipients undergoing diagnostic OLB from 1975 to 1986. Bronchoscopic and OLB cultures, histopathologic studies, serological data, and autopsy results were all carefully examined. An assessment of therapeutic alteration as a result of OLB was made, and clinical changes attributable to an OLB-directed therapeutic alteration were sought. Ninety-four OLBs and 37 bronchoscopic examinations were performed in 87 patients. All patients had undergone bone marrow transplantation, most often for leukemia (58/87) or aplastic anemia (13/87). The mean interval from bone marrow transplantation to OLB was 106 days. There were no intraoperative complications, but minor postoperative surgical complications were frequent (incidence, 21%). Postoperative mortality, defined as a death occurring within 30 days of surgery, was 45% (39/87). Seventy-four percent of the patients (64/87) died during the course of the study, at a mean of 43 days after OLB.

Because of the regulatory role of iron in transferrin receptor expression, we have now examined the relationship between iron and the release of soluble transferrin receptor from HL60 cells. Cells grown in serum-free, transferrin-free medium containing iron-pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (Fe-PIH) displayed approximately 70% less iodine 125-labeled transferrin surface binding and released 60% less soluble transferrin receptor than cells grown in serum-supplemented medium. Incubation of cells with increasing concentrations of Fe-PIH resulted in a progressive decrease in the release of soluble transferrin receptor over 18 hours of incubation. In contrast, receptor release was increased after incubation of cells with the iron chelator deferoxamine. This effect was completely blocked by cycloheximide. Transferrin receptor release from cells over 2 hours was unaffected by the presence of transferrin-iron, suggesting that transferrin receptor release occurs independent of the cellular handling of its ligand. Exposure of cells to phorbol myristate acetate resulted in a decrease in cell surface transferrin receptor and a decrease in the release of soluble transferrin receptor. Our studies show that transferrin receptor release from HL60 cells changes during iron excess or iron deficiency and that these changes are the result of alterations in cell surface transferrin receptor density. Our studies suggest that elevated serum transferrin receptor levels seen in clinical iron deficiency reflect corresponding increases in transferrin receptors at the cellular level.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Zivkovic-Gilgenbach, Z']","['Chitambar CR', 'Zivkovic-Gilgenbach Z']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '3THM379K8A (Pyridoxal)', '737-86-0 (pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'V83O1VOZ8L (Isoniazid)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Humans', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Isoniazid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Pyridoxal/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1990 Sep;116(3):345-53.,['R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Fourty-three of them (16.4%) were demonstrated to be accompanied with sepsis by blood culture. In acute non-lymphocytic leukemias (AML, APL, AMoL) the rate of sepsis was 33.8% (27 patients), while in lymphocytic malignancies (ML, HD, ATL) it was 11.7% (16 patients), particularly being 3.0% in ATL.

Hypogammaglobulinemia was one of the characteristic features in lymphocytic malignancies but not in acute non-lymphocytic leukemias. Hypogammaglobulinemia in lymphocytic malignancies might be affected by long-term immunodepressant therapy. Immunologic skin reaction was demonstrated to be decreased in lymphocytic malignancies on admission. From the findings mentioned above, affecting factors to infections may be mainly neutropenia in acute non-lymphocytic leukemias and immunodeficiency in lymphocytic malignancies. And sepsis can occur frequently under neutropenic condition. In ATL both of humoral- and cellular-immunologic disturbance were detected before therapy. But peripheral neutrophil count was maintained to be normal and this could be the reason for the low septic incidence in ATL despite of total immunodepression.","['Yokota, T', 'Shishime, E', 'Okayama, A', 'Ishizaki, J', 'Murai, K', 'Shioiri, S', 'Tachibana, N', 'Tsuda, K']","['Yokota T', 'Shishime E', 'Okayama A', 'Ishizaki J', 'Murai K', 'Shioiri S', 'Tachibana N', 'Tsuda K']","['Second Department of Medicine, Miyazaki Medical College.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

Lipotrope (choline and methionine) deficiency is a powerful potentiator of chemical carcinogenesis in liver and, under some conditions, in other tissues in rodents. Methotrexate (MTX), another commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, interferes with one-carbon metabolism and limits availability of lipotropes. Studies of PCZ carcinogenesis in lipotrope-deficient or MTX-treated male rats are reported, showing that both deficiency and MTX increased PCZ carcinogenicity in the mammary gland. In addition, PCZ was found to induce abnormalities of hepatic choline metabolism. Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed control (C) or lipotrope-deficient (D) diet. After 3 weeks, C and D rats were given PCZ, MTX, the two drugs together or 0.9% saline by i.p. injection. Doses were 0.2 or 0.5 mg MTX/kg or 25 mg PCZ/kg, given 2 or 3 days per week for 5 or 14 weeks. After 5 weeks of drug treatment livers were assayed for choline, phosphatidylcholine, phosphocholine (PCho), glycerophosphocholine and betaine. PCZ perturbed choline metabolism, increasing hepatic choline and PCho in deficient or MTX-treated rats and, to a smaller extent, in rats fed control diet. MTX markedly enhanced the effect of PCZ on choline metabolism. PCZ-induced mammary tumor incidence was increased 50-70% by lipotrope deficiency or by MTX. In PCZ-treated rats, cumulative probability of bearing a mammary tumor was significantly increased by lipotrope deficiency (P = 0.05), and was increased similarly but not significantly by MTX (P = 0.1). Cumulative tumor numbers per group in PCZ-treated rats were significantly greater in both deficient and MTX-treated rats compared to rats fed control diet (P less than 0.005).

The MAbs were tested separately, and in combination, for their ability to inhibit growth of CCRF-CEM leukemic T-cells in tissue culture. One MAb, D65.30, an IgG1, inhibited growth of CCRF-CEM cells as effectively as the anti-Tf receptor MAb 42/6, an IgA, previously found to have the highest antiproliferative activity in this assay. Some combinations of two or more MAbs inhibited the in vitro growth of CCRF-CEM much more effectively than single MAbs. Eleven IgG1 anti-Tf receptor MAbs, when combined individually with D65.30, increased the inhibition of CCRF-CEM growth from approximately 65% to greater than 90% in a 7-day growth assay. Similarly, many IgG MAbs in combination with 42/6 also inhibited CCRF-CEM growth by greater than 90%. The growth-inhibitory effects of certain combinations of MAbs were clearly synergistic, because either one or both MAbs tested separately were inactive. These pairs of MAbs also inhibited the growth of HL-60 and KG-1 leukemic cells by greater than 90% and partially inhibited the growth of K562 erythroleukemia and M21 melanoma cells, which are resistant to MAb 42/6. However, not all combinations of anti-Tf receptor MAbs were more effective; eight MAbs markedly antagonized the antiproliferative effects of D65.30, whereas 12 others had little or no effect. Preincubation of HL-60 cells with three different pairs of MAbs, D65.30 and A27.15, B3/25 and 42/6, and B3/25 and TR3A, inhibited subsequent colony formation by greater than 95%, demonstrating that their action is cytotoxic, not cytostatic. The antiproliferative activity of these pairs of MAbs correlates with their ability to block Tf-mediated 59Fe uptake and perturb Tf receptor expression. Treatment of nude mice bearing established s.c. CCRF-CEM tumors with a combination of MAbs D65.30 and A27.15 inhibited tumor growth and in some animals led to complete tumor regression. Each MAb administered separately was much less effective.

In the clinic, RA, NaB, or HMBA induce complete or partial remissions. However, the achievement and maintenance of effective plasma concentrations and toxicity have been problems. These difficulties led us to study the interaction of RA with these inducers. We found that combinations of RA with either NaB, HMBA, or DMSO synergistically induced terminal differentiation of HL60. A measure of the effectiveness of these combinations was that the doses of NaB, HMBA, and DMSO required alone to induce half-maximal differentiation were decreased about 4-fold in combination with normal plasma concentrations of about 30 nM RA. RA or NaB alone did not enhance the growth of HL60 cells. In contrast, HMBA or DMSO alone increased growth of HL60 cells even at concentrations that did not induce differentiation. The addition of RA reduced the promotion of growth and increased the extent of terminal differentiation seen with HMBA and DMSO alone. These data suggest that treatment of some malignancies with combinations of RA with HMBA or NaB may maintain differentiation-inducing effects and decrease the problems associated with the achievement and maintenance of effective plasma concentrations as single agents.","['Breitman, T R', 'He, R Y']","['Breitman TR', 'He RY']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Oct 1;50(19):6268-73.,,,,,,,,

We developed a CY-resistant subline of LBN AML by serial intravenous (IV) passage of AML cells followed by in vivo exposure to CY (100 mg/kg) 14 days later. After 18 and subsequent passages, CY-treated AML cells remained viable despite ex vivo incubation with 70 to 100 mumol/L 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC) or in vivo exposure to 100 to 300 mg/kg of CY. Once established, resistance to incubation with 4HC was stable in LBN AML cells after at least six serial in vivo passages without exposure to CY. Nevertheless, both control and CY-treated AML cells demonstrated similar dose-dependent sensitivity to 100 to 500 mumol/L phosphoramide mustard (PhM), the active alkylating end-product of CY activation in vivo. Levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which inactivates CY by prevention of formation of PhM, were significantly elevated in these CY-resistant AML cells: cytosolic and particulate ALDH fractions from these cells were 11 to 13 times control with NAD cofactor and propanal substrate and three to four times control with NADP cofactor and benzaldehyde substrate. Further studies with this animal model of AML, in which resistance to CY is mediated by elevated ALDH activity, may elucidate mechanisms for effective elimination of drug-resistant leukemic cells ex vivo and in vivo.","['Koelling, T M', 'Yeager, A M', 'Hilton, J', 'Haynie, D T', 'Wiley, J M']","['Koelling TM', 'Yeager AM', 'Hilton J', 'Haynie DT', 'Wiley JM']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Hybrid Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/pharmacology', 'Rats/*genetics', 'Rats, Inbred Lew/*genetics', 'Rats, Inbred Strains/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",1990/09/15 00:00,1990/09/15 00:01,['1990/09/15 00:00'],"['1990/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79647-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Sep 15;76(6):1209-13.,"['P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA40282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Such cells appeared alone in colonies of less than 50 cells, together with macrophages in mixed colonies and also within clusters of T lymphocytes at high culture cell numbers. The morphologic resemblance to lymphoid dendritic cells was confirmed by electron microscopy and the cells were distinguished from macrophages by immunoenzymatic and immunogold labeling with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Like macrophages they were HLA-DR+ and CD4+. However, they lacked nonspecific esterase and the macrophage cytoplasmic marker Y1/82A. Most strikingly, cells were strongly HLA-DQ+ and expressed CD1a (T6), which is characteristic of skin Langerhans cells. Their functional similarity to lymphoid dendritic cells was demonstrated by their ability to stimulate allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactions. Dendritic cell colony numbers were estimated in both bone marrow and peripheral blood of controls and in leukemia and lymphoma patients before and after chemotherapy. Colony numbers were low in control blood and in patients before treatment (less than 1.0 to 3.7/10(5) cells). However, during hematopoietic recovery the mean value increased to 37.5/10(5) cells and this increase correlated closely with the observed increase in circulating colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) in individual patients. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated mitotic activity within CD1a+ colonies and a linear relationship between cultured cells and both pure and mixed colonies was consistent with their derivation from a single precursor. These data indicate that a novel hematopoietic progenitor of dendritic/Langerhans cells (DL-CFU) may now be identified in a clonal assay system and suggest a probable common progenitor for these cells and macrophages.","['Reid, C D', 'Fryer, P R', 'Clifford, C', 'Kirk, A', 'Tikerpae, J', 'Knight, S C']","['Reid CD', 'Fryer PR', 'Clifford C', 'Kirk A', 'Tikerpae J', 'Knight SC']","['Section of Haematology, Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Autoradiography', 'Blood Cells/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Langerhans Cells/*cytology/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phenotype']",1990/09/15 00:00,1990/09/15 00:01,['1990/09/15 00:00'],"['1990/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79638-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Sep 15;76(6):1139-49.,,,,,,,,

Post mortem lung biopsies were taken for pathologic examination. They showed thrombi composed of leukaemic blast cells which obstructed and distended the lumens of pulmonary arterioles and capillaries. The respiratory distress is attributed to pulmonary leukostasis. Toxic substances released from the leukostatic leukaemic cell or local hypoxia due to vascular occlusion produce this endothelial cell and basement membrane damage. An infectious origin or endogenous pyrogen substances released from leukaemic monocytes may explain the fever. The frequent occurrence of pulmonary leukostasis in patients with leukocyte count greater than 100,000/mm3 point out the need for prevention or therapy of pulmonary leukostasis in these high-risk patients.

Leukemia incidence data (1979-84) were collected from a population-based cancer registry. For females, the standardized incidence ratio was elevated only in towns in the highest of three exposure categories. No association was observed in males in any of the exposure categories. A Poisson regression analysis of the data, using finer exposure strata, indicated an increase in risk among females with increasing level of contamination which appeared to be distributed evenly across all age strata. The rate ratio for females at the highest exposure stratum for total non-THM VOCs compared to the least exposed stratum was 1.68.
