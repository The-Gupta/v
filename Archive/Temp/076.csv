Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can affect the genetic susceptibility to infections or even sepsis. We sought to investigate the impact of different SNPs on the incidence of developing sepsis and pneumonia in patients with newly diagnosed AML following induction chemotherapy. We analyzed three SNPs in the TLR2 (Arg753Gln) and TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) gene in a cohort of 155 patients with AML who received induction chemotherapy. The risk of developing sepsis and pneumonia was assessed by multiple logistic regression analyses. The presence of the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism was significantly associated with pneumonia in AML patients (odds ratio (OR): 10.78; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-58.23; P=0.006). Furthermore, the cosegregating TLR4 polymorphisms Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile were independent risk factors for the development of both sepsis and pneumonia (OR: 3.55; 95% CI: 1.21-10.4, P=0.021 and OR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.3-9.86, P=0.014, respectively). To our best knowledge, this study represents the first analysis demonstrating that polymorphisms of TLR2 and TLR4 influence the risk of infectious complications in patients with AML undergoing induction chemotherapy.","['Schnetzke, U', 'Spies-Weisshart, B', 'Yomade, O', 'Fischer, M', 'Rachow, T', 'Schrenk, K', 'Glaser, A', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, M', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Scholl, S']","['Schnetzke U', 'Spies-Weisshart B', 'Yomade O', 'Fischer M', 'Rachow T', 'Schrenk K', 'Glaser A', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Scholl S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141127,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,"['0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Pneumonia/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/*genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/11/28 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gene201467 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2014.67 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2015 Jan-Feb;16(1):83-8. doi: 10.1038/gene.2014.67.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 681 patients with CML in Australia, Canada, and South Korea. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of chronic-phase CML, were Philadelphia chromosome and/or BCR-ABL positive, were aged 18 years or older, and had been treated with first-line imatinib therapy between January 2005 and September 2010. Data on patient demographics, medical history (e.g., comorbidities, Sokal score), and treatment characteristics (e.g., time to initiation, therapy duration) were abstracted. Descriptive analyses were stratified by country and therapy line. Prognostic indicators of response to imatinib were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for country, patient demographics, medical history, treatment characteristics, and side effects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months following initiation of each therapy line. RESULTS: Patients' average age was 57 years, and 59% were male. Overall, imatinib was initiated approximately 4 months following CML diagnosis. Complete or major molecular response (C/MMR) at 6 months following imatinib initiation was 54% in Australia, 22% in Canada, and 38% in South Korea. At 18 months, over 60% of patients achieved C/MMR. Approximately 30% of patients discontinued imatinib primarily due to intolerance and lack of response. Among patients who received second-line treatment, dasatinib was used more frequently than nilotinib. Multivariable regression results indicated Sokal score was identified as a prognostic indicator of response to imatinib therapy at several time points. LIMITATIONS: There are several limitations to this study. First, we selected a convenience sample of patients and physicians and therefore results may not be representative of the true population of patients with chronic-phase CML. Second, data were entered by the selected physician and could be subject to data entry errors or inaccuracies. Third, limited information was collected from the patient records, and it is possible that we did not capture additional prognostic or confounding factors related to the measured outcomes. Next, because this was an analysis of previously documented data (i.e., retrospective), we were unable to provide a priori definitions of response. Finally, multivariable analyses were limited to imatinib-related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment patterns and prognostic indicators differed by country. Health care providers, payers, and patients can utilize these results to inform treatment and policies aimed at improving the effectiveness of care for patients with chronic-phase CML.","['Whiteley, Jennifer', 'Iyer, Shrividya', 'Candrilli, Sean D', 'Kaye, James A']","['Whiteley J', 'Iyer S', 'Candrilli SD', 'Kaye JA']","['Pfizer Inc. , New York, NY , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150130,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/economics/therapeutic use', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medication Therapy Management/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data"", 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2014.991817 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2015 Feb;31(2):299-314. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.991817.

This study summarized data from the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) on genotype-phenotype relationships of ELANE mutations to important clinical outcomes. We also summarize findings for ELANE mutations not observed in SCNIR patients. RECENT FINDINGS: There were 307 SCNIR patients with 104 distinctive ELANE mutations who were followed longitudinally for up to 27 years. The ELANE mutations were diverse; there were 65 single amino acid substitutions; 61 of these mutations (94%) were 'probably' or 'possibly damaging' by PolyPhen-2 analysis, and one of the 'benign' mutations was associated with two cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). All frame-shift mutations (19/19) were associated with the SCN. The pattern of mutations in the SCN versus CyN was significantly different (P < 10), but some mutations were observed in both groups (overlapping mutations). The cumulative incidence of severe adverse events, that is, myelodysplasia, AML, stem cell transplantation, or deaths was significantly greater for patients with SCN versus those with CyN or overlapping mutations. Specific mutations (i.e. G214R or C151Y) had a high risk for evolution to AML.

Despite intensive efforts to improve BC treatments, patients with TN BC continue to exhibit poor survival, with half developing resistance to chemotherapy. Here we identify autophagy as a key mechanism in the progression and chemoresistance of a subset of TN tumors. We demonstrate that LC3B, a protein involved in autophagosome formation, is a reliable marker of poor prognosis in TN BC, validating this prognostic value at both the mRNA and protein levels in several independent cohorts. We also show that LC3B has no prognostic value for other BC subtypes (Luminal or HER2 BC), thus revealing a specific impact of autophagy on TN tumors. Autophagy is essential for the proliferative and invasive properties in 3D of TN BC cells characterized by high LC3B levels. Interestingly, the activity of the transcriptional co-activator YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) is regulated by the autophagy process and we identify YAP1 as a new actor in the autophagy-dependent proliferative and invasive properties of high-LC3B TN BC. Finally, inhibiting autophagy by silencing ATG5 or ATG7 significantly impaired high-LC3B TN tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, using a patient-derived TN tumor transplanted into mice, we show that an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine, potentiates the effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Overall, our data identify LC3B as a new prognostic marker for TN BC and the inhibition of autophagy as a promising therapeutic strategy for TN BC patients.","['Lefort, Sylvain', 'Joffre, Carine', 'Kieffer, Yann', 'Givel, Anne-Marie', 'Bourachot, Brigitte', 'Zago, Giulia', 'Bieche, Ivan', 'Dubois, Thierry', 'Meseure, Didier', 'Vincent-Salomon, Anne', 'Camonis, Jacques', 'Mechta-Grigoriou, Fatima']","['Lefort S', 'Joffre C', 'Kieffer Y', 'Givel AM', 'Bourachot B', 'Zago G', 'Bieche I', 'Dubois T', 'Meseure D', 'Vincent-Salomon A', 'Camonis J', 'Mechta-Grigoriou F']","['a Laboratory of Stress and Cancer; Institut Curie ; Paris , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/drug effects/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15548627.2014.981788 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2014;10(12):2122-42. doi: 10.4161/15548627.2014.981788.,['NOTNLM'],"['3-dimensional culture', '3D, 3-dimensions', 'AC, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide', 'ACTB, actin, beta', 'AP2A1/adaptin, adaptor-related protein complex 2, alpha 1 subunit', 'ATG, autophagy-related', 'BC, breast cancer', 'BECN1, Beclin 1, autophagy related', 'BafA1, bafilomycin A1', 'Ctrl, control', 'DFS, disease-free survival', ""EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution"", 'ERBB2/HER2, v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2', 'GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase', 'HScore, histological scoring', 'IHC, immunohistochemistry', 'LC3B', 'Lum, Luminal', 'MAP1LC3B/LC3B, microtubule-associated protein one light chain 3 beta', 'OS, overall survival', 'PDX, patient-derived xenografted tumor', 'TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'TGI, tumor growth inhibition', 'TN BC, triple-negative breast cancer', 'YAP1', 'YAP1, Yes-associated protein 1', 'autophagy', 'breast cancers', 'i.p., intra-peritoneal', 'prognosis', 'response to treatment', 'sem, standard error of mean', 'three-MA, 3-methyladenine']",,PMC4502743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both leukemic and quiescent normal hematopoietic stem cells preferentially reside in the osteoblastic niche. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are located near them, playing a critical role in their regulation. Currently, with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, long term clinical responses are achieved in most CML cases.

Early stages in cancer development might be present years before cancers become clinically apparent. METHODS: We analyzed data from whole-exome sequencing of DNA in peripheral-blood cells from 12,380 persons, unselected for cancer or hematologic phenotypes. We identified somatic mutations on the basis of unusual allelic fractions. We used data from Swedish national patient registers to follow health outcomes for 2 to 7 years after DNA sampling. RESULTS: Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations was observed in 10% of persons older than 65 years of age but in only 1% of those younger than 50 years of age. Detectable clonal expansions most frequently involved somatic mutations in three genes (DNMT3A, ASXL1, and TET2) that have previously been implicated in hematologic cancers. Clonal hematopoiesis was a strong risk factor for subsequent hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 12.9; 95% confidence interval, 5.8 to 28.7). Approximately 42% of hematologic cancers in this cohort arose in persons who had clonality at the time of DNA sampling, more than 6 months before a first diagnosis of cancer. Analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens obtained from two patients at the time of diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia revealed that their cancers arose from the earlier clones. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations is readily detected by means of DNA sequencing, is increasingly common as people age, and is associated with increased risks of hematologic cancer and death. A subset of the genes that are mutated in patients with myeloid cancers is frequently mutated in apparently healthy persons; these mutations may represent characteristic early events in the development of hematologic cancers.

There is a constant need for new prognostic factors that could facilitate patient risk stratification. The aim of our research was to determine the phosphorylation levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in leukemic cells, their relation to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression/activity and their prognostic significance in adult de novo AML. A total of 118 patients with AML were enrolled in the study. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis we found that P-gp activity and Akt phosphorylation were independent poor prognostic factors of overall survival (OS). In contrast, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) represented a favorable prognostic factor of OS and relapse-free survival (RFS). A negative correlation between P-gp activity and p38 phosphorylation level was found, implying a possible role of this MAPK pathway in P-gp regulation. In addition, we found correlation between Akt and p38 phosphorylation levels, indicative of co-activation of two signaling cascades in AML.","['Prijic, Sanja', 'Ugrina, Ivo', 'Labar, Boris', 'Nemet, Damir', 'Batinic, Josip', 'Zadro, Renata', 'Ries, Suncica', 'Gjadrov-Kuvedzic, Koraljka', 'Davidovic, Sanja', 'Batinic, Drago']","['Prijic S', 'Ugrina I', 'Labar B', 'Nemet D', 'Batinic J', 'Zadro R', 'Ries S', 'Gjadrov-Kuvedzic K', 'Davidovic S', 'Batinic D']","['a Clinical Unit of Cellular Immunodiagnostics and In Vitro Procedures, Clinical Department of Laboratory Diagnostics , University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'b Genos d.o.o., Zagreb , Croatia.', 'c Center for Expert Medicine , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'd Department of Hematology , University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'e School of Medicine, University of Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'd Department of Hematology , University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'e School of Medicine, University of Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'f Clinical Unit of Special and Molecular Hematology, Clinical Department of Laboratory Diagnostics , University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'g Department of Pathology and Cytology , University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'g Department of Pathology and Cytology , University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'h Clinical Unit of Cytogenetics and FISH Diagnostics of Hemato-oncological Disease, Department of Pediatrics , University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'a Clinical Unit of Cellular Immunodiagnostics and In Vitro Procedures, Clinical Department of Laboratory Diagnostics , University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.', 'e School of Medicine, University of Zagreb , Zagreb , Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141229,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/11/27 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.990012 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(8):2281-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.990012.

In patients who achieved a complete remission (CR), low or high WT1 expression was significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS) compared to intermediate WT1 expression (49% for WT1high vs. 63% for WT1low vs. 93% for WT1int; p=0.008). Moreover, there were significant differences in relapse-free survival (RFS) between the three expression groups (42% for WT1high vs. 63% for WT1low vs. 83% for WT1int; p=0.047).

Having a few samples of microarrays in cancer researches is always one of the most concerns which lead to some problems in designing the classifiers. For this matter, preprocessing gene selection techniques should be utilized before classification to remove the noninformative genes from the microarray data. An appropriate gene selection method can significantly improve the performance of cancer classification. In this paper, we use selective independent component analysis (SICA) for decreasing the dimension of microarray data. Using this selective algorithm, we can solve the instability problem occurred in the case of employing conventional independent component analysis (ICA) methods. First, the reconstruction error and selective set are analyzed as independent components of each gene, which have a small part in making error in order to reconstruct new sample. Then, some of the modified support vector machine (upsilon-SVM) algorithm sub-classifiers are trained, simultaneously. Eventually, the best sub-classifier with the highest recognition rate is selected. The proposed algorithm is applied on three cancer datasets (leukemia, breast cancer and lung cancer datasets), and its results are compared with other existing methods. The results illustrate that the proposed algorithm (SICA + upsilon-SVM) has higher accuracy and validity in order to increase the classification accuracy. Such that, our proposed algorithm exhibits relative improvements of 3.3% in correctness rate over ICA + SVM and SVM algorithms in lung cancer dataset.","['Saberkari, Hamidreza', 'Shamsi, Mousa', 'Joroughi, Mahsa', 'Golabi, Faegheh', 'Sedaaghi, Mohammad Hossein']","['Saberkari H', 'Shamsi M', 'Joroughi M', 'Golabi F', 'Sedaaghi MH']","['Department of Electrical Engineering, Genomic Signal Processing Laboratory, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Genomic Signal Processing Laboratory, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Genomic Signal Processing Laboratory, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Genomic Signal Processing Laboratory, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Genomic Signal Processing Laboratory, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Med Signals Sens,Journal of medical signals and sensors,101577416,,,,2014/11/27 06:00,2014/11/27 06:01,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/27 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Signals Sens. 2014 Oct;4(4):291-8.,['NOTNLM'],"['Classification', 'deoxyribonucleic acid', 'gene selection', 'independent component analysis', 'microarray', 'support vector machine']",,PMC4236808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PSGL-1, a major surface receptor protein for leukocyte, also acts as a signaling receptor in leukocyte rolling. To investigate the role of lipid raft in PSGL-1 signaling in human neutrophils, we quantitatively analyzed lipid raft proteome of human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells and identified a lipid raft-associated protein beta-adducin. PSGL-1 ligation induced dissociation of the raft-associated protein beta-adducin from lipid rafts and actin, as well as phosphorylation of beta-adducin, indicating a transient uncoupling of lipid rafts from the actin cytoskeleton. Knockdown of beta-adducin greatly attenuated HL-60 cells rolling on P-selectin. We also showed that Src kinase is crucial for PSGL-1 ligation-induced beta-adducin phosphorylation and relocation. Taken together, these results show that beta-adducin is a pivotal lipid raft-associated protein in PSGL-1-mediated neutrophil rolling on P-selectin.","['Xu, Tingshuang', 'Liu, Wenai', 'Yang, Chen', 'Ba, Xueqing', 'Wang, Xiaoguang', 'Jiang, Yong', 'Zeng, Xianlu']","['Xu T', 'Liu W', 'Yang C', 'Ba X', 'Wang X', 'Jiang Y', 'Zeng X']","['*Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; Department of Bioscience, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, China; and Department of Pathophysiology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '*Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; Department of Bioscience, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, China; and Department of Pathophysiology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '*Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; Department of Bioscience, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, China; and Department of Pathophysiology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '*Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; Department of Bioscience, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, China; and Department of Pathophysiology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '*Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; Department of Bioscience, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, China; and Department of Pathophysiology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China zengx779@nenu.edu.cn wangxiaoguang58@sina.com.', '*Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; Department of Bioscience, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, China; and Department of Pathophysiology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '*Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; Department of Bioscience, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, China; and Department of Pathophysiology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China zengx779@nenu.edu.cn wangxiaoguang58@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141125,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (ADD2 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (P-selectin ligand protein)', '0 (SELP protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Rolling/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*immunology', 'P-Selectin/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport/immunology']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.2A0114-016R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.2A0114-016R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2015 Feb;97(2):297-306. doi: 10.1189/jlb.2A0114-016R.

By accurately segregating groups of cooccurring mutations into distinct clonal populations, we identified codominant clones in the majority of patients. Evaluation of intraclonal mutation patterns identified clone-specific punctuated cytosine mutagenesis events, showed that most structural variants are acquired before SNVs, determined that KRAS mutations occur late in disease development but are not sufficient for clonal dominance, and identified clones within the same patient that are arrested at varied stages in B-cell development. Taken together, these data order the sequence of genetic events that underlie childhood ALL and provide a framework for understanding the development of the disease at single-cell resolution.","['Gawad, Charles', 'Koh, Winston', 'Quake, Stephen R']","['Gawad C', 'Koh W', 'Quake SR']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305; and Departments of Bioengineering and Applied Physics, Stanford University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford,CA 94305.', 'Departments of Bioengineering and Applied Physics, Stanford University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford,CA 94305.', 'Departments of Bioengineering and Applied Physics, Stanford University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford,CA 94305 quake@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141125,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/physiology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Exome/genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/04/30 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1420822111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1420822111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Dec 16;111(50):17947-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1420822111.

In human B lymphocytes, HVCN1 associates with the B-cell receptor (BCR) and is required for optimal BCR signaling and redox control. HVCN1 is expressed in malignant B cells that rely on BCR signaling, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. However, little is known about its regulation in these cells. We found that HVCN1 was expressed in B cells as two protein isoforms. The shorter isoform (HVCN1S) was enriched in B cells from a cohort of 76 CLL patients. When overexpressed in a B-cell lymphoma line, HVCN1S responded more profoundly to protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation. This more potent enhanced gating response was mediated by increased phosphorylation of the same residue responsible for enhanced gating in HVCN1L, Thr(29). Furthermore, the association of HVCN1S with the BCR was weaker, which resulted in its diminished internalization upon BCR stimulation. Finally, HVCN1S conferred a proliferative and migratory advantage as well as enhanced BCR-dependent signaling. Overall, our data show for the first time, to our knowledge, the existence of a shorter isoform of HVCN1 with enhanced gating that is specifically enriched in malignant B cells. The properties of HVCN1S suggest that it may contribute to the pathogenesis of BCR-dependent B-cell malignancies.","['Hondares, Elayne', 'Brown, Mark Adrian', 'Musset, Boris', 'Morgan, Deri', 'Cherny, Vladimir V', 'Taubert, Christina', 'Bhamrah, Mandeep K', 'Coe, David', 'Marelli-Berg, Federica', 'Gribben, John G', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'DeCoursey, Thomas E', 'Capasso, Melania']","['Hondares E', 'Brown MA', 'Musset B', 'Morgan D', 'Cherny VV', 'Taubert C', 'Bhamrah MK', 'Coe D', 'Marelli-Berg F', 'Gribben JG', 'Dyer MJ', 'DeCoursey TE', 'Capasso M']","['Centre for Cancer and Inflammation, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Cancer and Inflammation, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom;', 'ICS-4 Forschungszentrum Julich, 52425 Julich, Germany;', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, Rush University, Chicago, IL 60612;', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, Rush University, Chicago, IL 60612;', 'Centre for Cancer and Inflammation, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom;', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Leicester LE1 9HN, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Biochemical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Biochemical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom; and.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 9HN, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, Rush University, Chicago, IL 60612; tdecours@rush.edu m.capasso@qmul.ac.uk.', 'Centre for Cancer and Inflammation, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom; tdecours@rush.edu m.capasso@qmul.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141125,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (HVCN1 protein, human)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/04/30 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1411390111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1411390111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Dec 16;111(50):18078-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1411390111.

We attempted to identify risk factors for IF in a prospective cohort of hematologic patients treated in 8 centers in Brazil. METHODS: Patients with (cases) and without (controls) proven or probable IF diagnosed in a cohort of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS), and in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients (early, until day 40; late, after day 40 posttransplant) were compared by univariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 237 induction remission courses of AML/MDS and 663 HCTs (345 allogeneic and 318 autologous), 25 cases of IF were diagnosed. In the AML/MDS cohort, active smoking (hazard ratio [HR], 9.11 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.04-40.71]) was associated with IF. Variables associated with IF in the early phase of allogeneic HCT were receipt of antithymocyte globulin (HR, 22.77 [95% CI, 4.85-101.34]), hyperglycemia (HR, 5.17 [95% CI, 1.40-19.11]), center 7 (HR, 5.15 [95% CI, 1.66-15.97]), and AML (HR, 4.38 [95% CI, 1.39-13.81]), and in the late phase were nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen (HR, 35.08 [95% CI, 3.90-315.27]), grade III/IV graft-vs-host disease (HR, 16.50 [95% CI, 2.67-102.28]), and previous invasive mold disease (HR, 10.65 [95% CI, 1.19-95.39]). CONCLUSIONS: Attempts to reduce the risk of IF may include smoking cessation, aggressive control of hyperglycemia, and the use of a mold-active agent as prophylaxis in patients receiving nonmyeloablative HCT or ATG in the conditioning regimen. Future research should further explore smoking and other prehospital variables as risks for IF.","['Garnica, Marcia', 'da Cunha, Marcos Oliveira', 'Portugal, Rodrigo', 'Maiolino, Angelo', 'Colombo, Arnaldo L', 'Nucci, Marcio']","['Garnica M', 'da Cunha MO', 'Portugal R', 'Maiolino A', 'Colombo AL', 'Nucci M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Naval Marcilio Dias, Rio de Janeiro.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.', 'Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20141125,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Fusariosis/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking', '*Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ciu947 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciu947 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2015 Mar 15;60(6):875-80. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciu947.

In the pivotal phase 2 study of 111 patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, the overall response rate in patients who received ibrutinib 560 mg daily was 68%. The median progression-free survival was 13.9 months, and the overall survival was 58% at 18 months. In a recently published phase 3 trial (RESONATE) that compared ibrutinib and ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, ibrutinib at the daily dosage of 420 mg demonstrated a significantly higher overall response rate (43% in ibrutinib vs. 4% in ofatumumab) and a significantly improved overall survival at 12 months (90% ibrutinib vs. 81% ofatumumab). Similar clinical benefits were shown regardless of del (17 p). Ibrutinib was well tolerated, and dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. Ibrutinib has shown durable remission, improved progression-free survival and overall survival, and favorable safety profile in indolent B-cell lymphoid malignancies. Ibrutinib, as a monotherapy, is an effective treatment modality as a salvage therapy for treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma, particularly in older patients (age >/=70 years) who are not a candidate for intensive chemotherapy and/or those with del (17 p). In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and del (17 p), the current practice guideline recommends ibrutinib as an upfront treatment option. Current on-going trials will further define its role as upfront therapy and/or as a combination therapy in indolent B-cell lymphoid malignancies.","['Lee, Chung-Shien', 'Rattu, Mohammad A', 'Kim, Sara S']","['Lee CS', 'Rattu MA', 'Kim SS']","['Department of Pharmacy, The Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, USA leec3@stjohns.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141125,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2014/11/27 06:00,2016/09/22 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155214561281 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155214561281 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2016 Feb;22(1):92-104. doi: 10.1177/1078155214561281.

To investigate whether dysfunction in RNA splicing is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data. This analysis revealed that mutations in spliceosomal component genes occurred in 5.6% of unselected breast cancers, including hotspot mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which were found in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive disease, AKT1 mutations, and distinct copy number alterations. Additional profiling of hotspot mutations in a panel of special histological subtypes of breast cancer showed that 16% and 6% of papillary and mucinous carcinomas of the breast harboured the SF3B1 K700E mutation. RNA sequencing identified differentially spliced events expressed in tumours with SF3B1 mutations including the protein coding genes TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNL11, UQCC, and ABCC5, and the long non-coding RNA CRNDE. Moreover, SF3B1 mutant cell lines were found to be sensitive to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A and treatment resulted in perturbation of the splicing signature. Albeit rare, SF3B1 mutations result in alternative splicing events, and may constitute drivers and a novel therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers.","['Maguire, Sarah L', 'Leonidou, Andri', 'Wai, Patty', 'Marchio, Caterina', 'Ng, Charlotte Ky', 'Sapino, Anna', 'Salomon, Anne-Vincent', 'Reis-Filho, Jorge S', 'Weigelt, Britta', 'Natrajan, Rachael C']","['Maguire SL', 'Leonidou A', 'Wai P', 'Marchio C', 'Ng CK', 'Sapino A', 'Salomon AV', 'Reis-Filho JS', 'Weigelt B', 'Natrajan RC']","['The Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141222,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (spliceostatin A)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Alternative Splicing/drug effects/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrans/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spiro Compounds/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.4483 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2015 Mar;235(4):571-80. doi: 10.1002/path.4483.

AUL is extremely rare in both humans and dogs, has a rapid clinical course and does not respond to treatment. It is characterised by the presence of blast cells within the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood at levels >/= 20% and even up to 100% of all nucleated cells. Blast cells are unable to be differentiated on morphological, cytochemical and phenotypic criteria into myeloid or lymphoid lineages because of their immaturity and/or atypia. CASE REPORT: An 8-year-old German Shepherd dog was referred for depression, asthenia, mild anaemia, thrombocytopenia and marked leucocytosis. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bilateral nephromegaly and enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Echocardiography revealed biventricular hypertrophy with abnormal tissue density of the myocardium. Blood and bone marrow smears were composed of 95% unclassifiable and/or atypical blast cells and signs of dysplasia of the erythroid and thrombocytic/megakaryocytic lineages were present. Blast cells were negative for all cytochemical stains used and flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed 85% of total leucocytes consisting of small-to-medium-sized cells, negative for all lymphoid and myeloid markers except CD45 and CD34. After necropsy, cytology and histology revealed that blast cells had diffusely infiltrated all tissues examined. Both erythroid and megakaryocytic extramedullary haemopoiesis was also detected in the spleen, lymph nodes and liver. All immunohistochemical stains used were negative. CONCLUSION: On the basis of all the results, a diagnosis of acute leukaemia involving a very primitive haematopoietic precursor was made.","['Miglio, A', 'Antognoni, M T', 'Miniscalco, B', 'Caivano, D', 'Lepri, E', 'Birettoni, F', 'Mangili, V']","['Miglio A', 'Antognoni MT', 'Miniscalco B', 'Caivano D', 'Lepri E', 'Birettoni F', 'Mangili V']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia, Via San Costanzo 4, 06126, Perugia, Italy. miglioarianna@libero.it.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Examination/veterinary', 'Dog Diseases/blood/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Dogs', 'Euthanasia, Animal', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/blood/diagnosis/physiopathology/*veterinary']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/08/11 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/avj.12273 [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 2014 Dec;92(12):499-503. doi: 10.1111/avj.12273.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute undifferentiated leukaemia', 'cardiac neoplasia', 'cytochemistry', 'dogs', 'flow cytometry', 'immunohistochemistry']",,,,,,['(c) 2014 Australian Veterinary Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model considers four health states: complete remission, treatment failure or relapse, post-failure, and death. Markov cycle length was 1 month for the first 48 months and 1 year thereafter. Efficacy outcomes in terms of event-free survival and overall survival were taken from a head-to-head clinical trial. Costs were associated with drug and administration, adverse events (AEs), treatment of relapses, follow-up visits, and productivity losses. Utilities and disutilities associated with health states and AEs were derived from the literature. Compared to ATRA + IDA, ATRA + ATO is associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $CAD50,193/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and $CAD50,338/QALY from a Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and societal perspectives, respectively. Results of the one-way sensitivity analysis show that ICER varied from $CAD23,045 to $CAD60,759/QALY (MoH perspective) and from $CAD23,120 to $CAD60,905/QALY (societal perspective). ATO in the first-line therapy for patients with APL can be considered a more cost-effective strategy than standard treatment from a Canadian perspective.","['Lachaine, Jean', 'Mathurin, Karine', 'Barakat, Stephane', 'Schuh, Andre C']","['Lachaine J', 'Mathurin K', 'Barakat S', 'Schuh AC']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Market Access and Health Outcomes, Lundbeck Canada Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141125,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Canada', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Oxides/*economics/therapeutic use']",2014/11/27 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2176 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2015 Dec;33(4):229-38. doi: 10.1002/hon.2176.

We previously defined LPA and S1P signaling in proliferating human neural progenitor (hNP) cells, and the current study investigates their role in neuronal differentiation of these cells. Differentiation in the presence of LPA or S1P significantly enhanced cell survival and decreased expression of neuronal markers. Further, the LPA receptor antagonist Ki16425 fully blocked the effects of LPA, and differentiation in the presence of Ki16425 dramatically enhanced neurite length. LPA and S1P robustly activated Erk, but surprisingly both strongly suppressed Akt activation. Ki16425 and pertussis toxin blocked LPA activation of Erk but not LPA inhibition of Akt, suggesting distinct receptor and G-protein subtypes mediate these effects. Finally, we explored cross talk between lysophospholipid signaling and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LPA/S1P effects on neuronal differentiation were amplified in the presence of LIF. Similarly, the ability of LPA/S1P to regulate Erk and Akt was impacted by the presence of LIF; LIF enhanced the inhibitory effect of LPA/S1P on Akt phosphorylation, while LIF blunted the activation of Erk by LPA/S1P. Taken together, our results suggest that LPA and S1P enhance survival and inhibit neuronal differentiation of hNP cells, and LPA1 is critical for the effect of LPA. The pleiotropic effects of LPA may reflect differences in receptor subtype expression or cross talk with LIF receptor signaling.","['Callihan, Phillip', 'Ali, Mourad W', 'Salazar, Hector', 'Quach, Nhat', 'Wu, Xian', 'Stice, Steven L', 'Hooks, Shelley B']","['Callihan P', 'Ali MW', 'Salazar H', 'Quach N', 'Wu X', 'Stice SL', 'Hooks SB']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.', 'Department of Animal and Dairy Science, Regenerative Bioscience Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.', 'Department of Animal and Dairy Science, Regenerative Bioscience Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA shooks@uga.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141124,United States,ASN Neuro,ASN neuro,101507115,"['0 (3-(4-(4-((1-(2-chlorophenyl)ethoxy)carbonyl amino)-3-methyl-5-isoxazolyl)', 'benzylsulfanyl) propanoic acid)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (NUDT6 protein, rat)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 3)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Lysophospholipids/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['6/6/1759091414558416 [pii]', '10.1177/1759091414558416 [doi]']",epublish,ASN Neuro. 2014 Nov 24;6(6). pii: 6/6/1759091414558416. doi: 10.1177/1759091414558416.

METHODS: The current survey compared transplantation outcomes for a cohort of 394 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients given bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings after FB (n = 218) or FM (n = 176). Patients given manipulated grafts and those given T-cell-depleting agents (anti-thymocyte globulins or alemtuzumab) were not included. RESULTS: At the time of transplantation, 266 patients (68%) were experiencing their first complete remission (CR), 69 (18%) were experiencing a later CR, and 59 (15%) had advanced disease. The incidences of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were similar in the 2 groups of patients. The 2-year relapse incidence (RI), nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate, leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate, and overall survival (OS) rate were 31% +/- 3%, 18% +/- 3%, 51% +/- 4%, and 54% +/- 4%, respectively, for FB patients and 20% +/- 3% (P = .007), 20% +/- 3% (P = .4), 60% +/- 4% (P = .08), and 62% +/- 4% (P = .2), respectively, for FM patients. Among FB patients given intravenous busulfan (n = 81), the 2-year RI, NRM, LFS, and OS rates were 26% +/- 5% (P = .43 vs FM patients), 25% +/- 6% (P = .18), 49% +/- 7% (P = .07), and 54% +/- 7% (P = .13), respectively. In multivariate analyses, FM was associated with a lower RI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; P = .01) and a trend toward higher NRM (HR, 1.6; P = .1) with similar LFS (HR, 0.8; P = .2) and OS (HR, 0.9; P = .6). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that although FM provides better AML control than FB as an RIC regimen for allo-SCT, the 2 regimens provide similar survival. Multicenter randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Peniket, Andy', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Baron F', 'Labopin M', 'Peniket A', 'Jindra P', 'Afanasyev B', 'Sanz MA', 'Deconinck E', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20141125,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/27 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/11/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29163 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Apr 1;121(7):1048-55. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29163.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to generate large-scale evidence on whether IKZF1 variants are risk factors for childhood AL. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, and Web of Science were searched up to June 2, 2014 for studies on the association of IKZF1 polymorphisms with childhood AL risk. Data were extracted and the odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by a fixed-effects or random-effects model. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity and leukemia subtype, sensitivity and cumulative meta-analyses were performed. Moreover, publication bias was assessed by Begg's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: In total, 33 case control studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. For rs4132601 polymorphism, significantly increased AL risk was observed in all genetic models (the association was still significant when the p value was Bonferroni adjusted to 0.025). In the subgroup analysis by tumor type, statistical association was observed in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL). Additionally, when stratified by ethnicity, significantly increased AL risk was only observed in European subgroup, but not among African or mixed population subgroups. Finally, similar results were found for rs11978267 polymorphism. CONCLUSION: In summary, this meta-analysis provides evidence that rs4132601 and rs11978267 polymorphisms in the IKZF1 gene might contribute to the occurrence of BCP-ALL, especially in European populations. Moreover, further studies with large sample size are required to clarify possible roles of IKZF1 variants in other ethnic groups (e.g., Asians and Africans).","['Dai, Yue-e', 'Tang, Linjun', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Dai YE', 'Tang L', 'Healy J', 'Sinnett D']","[""Nanjing Children's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Tongling People's Hospital, Tongling, Anhui, China."", 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20141125,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Publication Bias']",2014/11/26 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0113748 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-35913 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 25;9(11):e113748. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0113748. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4244140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM OF THE WORK: we aimed to evaluate the frequency of MLL/AF9 fusion gene in de novo AML patients, its impact on clinical features, and its prognostic significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight children patients with AML and 20 healthy controls were subjected to complete clinical examination and laboratory investigations including, complete hemogram and bone marrow (BM) examination. Diagnosis was based on FAB morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria. Detection of (MLL/AF9) fusion gene was assessed by dual color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Follow-up were carried out clinically and by blast count in BM, and response to therapy to detect the outcome of the disease. RESULTS: The incidence of MLL-fusion gene MLL/AF9 in AML cases was about (6/28) (21%). Four patients with MLL/AF9 fusion gene were newly diagnosed, two cases were at relapse and no patient at remission showed positivity. As regard the clinical outcome, five out of six MLL positive cases died, three of them during induction and two during relapse. The FAB AML subtypes with MLL/AF9 fusion were one M2, three M4, and two M5. CONCLUSION: MLL-fusion gene MLL/AF9 was found in about 21% of studied AML patients when assessed by FISH technique and this is of high clinical relevance as most of these abnormalities have been associated with poor prognosis.","['Hagag, Adel Abdelhaleim', 'Shebl, Shebl S', 'El-Fadaly, Nabih H']","['Hagag AA', 'Shebl SS', 'El-Fadaly NH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Tanta University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,South Asian J Cancer,South Asian journal of cancer,101618774,,,,2014/11/26 06:00,2014/11/26 06:01,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2278-330X.142964 [doi]', 'SAJC-3-206 [pii]']",ppublish,South Asian J Cancer. 2014 Oct;3(4):206-8. doi: 10.4103/2278-330X.142964.,['NOTNLM'],"['11q23/MLL gene', 'Acute myelobastic leukemia', 'Dual color FISH']",,PMC4236697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed our data to add to the existing literature. AIMS: Primary objective is to assess the progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary objective are cytogenetic response, overall survival (OS), and toxicities. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a retrospective analysis from the case records from a single institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional ethics committee approval was obtained. All the children diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) aged less than 18 years registered between 2000 and 2009 were enrolled. All the patients were started on IM at 260 mg/m(2). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate the PFS and OS. RESULTS: There were 64 children with median age of 13 years (range, 1-18) with male predominance (male:female (M: F) - 1.85:1). Sixty-one patients (95.4%) achieved complete hematological response (CHR) at median of 8 weeks. Thirty-seven (57.8%) patients had evaluation of cytogenetic response and were subjects for outcome analysis. The median time to best cytogenetic response evaluation was 13 months (range, 4-52).

MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) protein is an anti-apoptotic molecule in MM cells and regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and downstream signaling molecules STAT3, PI3K and MAPK. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of STAT3, PI3K and MAPK gene silence on MCL-1 expression in human MM cells and the consequence of cell survival. METHODS: Lentivirus small hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference techniques were utilized to knock down STAT3, PI3K or MAPK genes. Gene and protein expression was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR and Western Blot. MM cell apoptosis was examined by annexin-V FITC/propidium iodide staining. RESULTS: Efficient silence of STAT3, PI3K, MAPK1 or MAPK2 gene robustly abrogated IL-6 enhanced MCL-1 expression and suppressed MM cell growth. Silencing STAT3 gene inhibited PI3K expression, silencing PI3K markedly abrogated STAT3 and MAPK production. Inhibition of MAPK2 gene by shMAPK2 suppressed STAT3, PI3K and MAPK1 expression in the cells. Silencing of STAT3, PI3K and MAPK2 together completely blocked MCL-1 expression in MM cells. CONCLUSION: There is a syngeneic effect among the three independent STAT3, PI3K and MAPK2 survival-signaling pathways related to MCL-1 expression in MM cells. shRNAs silencing of STAT3, PI3K and MAPK2 together could provide an effective strategy to treat MM.","['Wang, Mengchang', 'Wu, Di', 'Liu, Pengbo', 'Deng, Jiusheng']","['Wang M', 'Wu D', 'Liu P', 'Deng J']","[""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061 China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061 China."", 'Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, 30322 USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, 30322 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141119,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,2014/11/26 06:00,2014/11/26 06:01,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/2162-3619-3-27 [doi]', '96 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2014 Nov 19;3(1):27. doi: 10.1186/2162-3619-3-27. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['MAPK', 'MCL-1', 'Multiple myeloma', 'PI3K', 'STAT3', 'shRNA']",,PMC4242602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of interest, the increase in the former two is due to the bystander effect of IL-4 that is secreted by promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-expressing NKT and gammadeltaT cells whereas the increase in the latter is cell intrinsic. Bcl11b zinc-finger proteins play key roles in T cell development and T cell-mediated immune response likely through TCR signaling. We examined thymocytes at and after the DP stage in Bcl11b (F/S826G) CD4cre, Bcl11b (F/+) CD4cre and Bcl11b (+/S826G) mice, carrying the allele that substituted serine for glycine at the position of 826. Here we show that Bcl11b impairment leads to an increase in the population of TCRalphabeta(high)CD44(high)CD122(high) innate CD8SP thymocytes, together with two different developmental abnormalities: impaired positive and negative selection accompanying a reduction in the number of CD8SP cells, and developmental arrest of NKT cells at multiple steps. The innate CD8SP thymocytes express Eomes and secrete IFN-gamma after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin, and in this case their increase is not due to a bystander effect of IL-4 but cell intrinsic. Those results indicate that Bcl11b regulates development of different thymocyte subsets at multiple stages and prevents an excess of innate CD8SP thymocytes.","['Hirose, Satoshi', 'Touma, Maki', 'Go, Rieka', 'Katsuragi, Yoshinori', 'Sakuraba, Yoshiyuki', 'Gondo, Yoichi', 'Abe, Manabu', 'Sakimura, Kenji', 'Mishima, Yukio', 'Kominami, Ryo']","['Hirose S', 'Touma M', 'Go R', 'Katsuragi Y', 'Sakuraba Y', 'Gondo Y', 'Abe M', 'Sakimura K', 'Mishima Y', 'Kominami R']","['Division of Molecular Biology, Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan hirose@med.niigata-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Niigata University, Niigata 950-2181, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Biology, Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Biology, Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.', 'Mutagenesis and Genomics Team, RIKEN BioResource Center, Ibaragi 305-0074, Japan.', 'Mutagenesis and Genomics Team, RIKEN BioResource Center, Ibaragi 305-0074, Japan.', 'Basic Neuroscience Branch, Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.', 'Basic Neuroscience Branch, Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Biology, Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Biology, Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141124,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Bcl11b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cd44 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Il2rb protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135845-89-5 (Idb3 protein, mouse)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (emt protein-tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2014/11/26 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['dxu104 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxu104 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2015 Apr;27(4):205-15. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxu104.

Cytogenetic analysis in acute leukemia is now routinely used to assist patient management, particularly in terms of diagnosis, disease monitoring, prognosis and risk stratification. Knowing about cytogenetic profile at the time of diagnosis is important in order to take critical decisions in management of the patients. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in Pakistani adult patients with ALL in order to have insights regarding behavior of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all the cases of ALL (>/=15years old) diagnosed at Aga Khan University from January 2006 to June 2014 was performed. Phenotype (B/T lineage) was confirmed in all cases by flow cytometry. Cytogenetic analysis was made for all cases using the trypsin-Giemsa banding technique. Karyotypes were interpreted using the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients were diagnosed as ALL during the study period, of which 151 samples successfully yielded metaphase chromosomes. The male to female ratio was 3.4:1. The majority (n=120, 72.3%) had a B-cell phenotype. A normal karyotype was present in 51% (n=77) of the cases whereas 49% (n=74) had an abnormal karyotype. Of the abnormal cases, 10% showed Philadelphia chromosome; t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). Other poor prognostic cytogenetic subgroups were t(4;11)(q21;q23), hypodiploidy (35-45 chromosomes) and complex karyotype. Hyperdiploidy (47-57 chromosomes) occurred in 6.6%; all of whom were younger than 30 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a relatively low prevalence of Philadelphia chromosome in Pakistani adults with ALL with an increase in frequency with age (p=0.003). The cumulative prevalence of Philadelphia- negative poor cytogenetic aberrations in different age groups was not significant (p=0.6).","['Shaikh, Muhammad Shariq', 'Adil, Salman Naseem', 'Shaikh, Mohammad Usman', 'Khurshid, Mohammad']","['Shaikh MS', 'Adil SN', 'Shaikh MU', 'Khurshid M']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, The Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan E-mail : muhammad.shariq@aku.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Male', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/26 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.21.9495 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(21):9495-8. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.21.9495.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using mtDNA from 23 subjects diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the first 450 bp of the d-loop region were amplified and successfully sequenced. RESULTS: This revealed 132 mutations at 25 positions in this region, with a mean of 6 alterations per subject. The d-loop alterations in mtDNA in subjects were all identified as single nucleotide polymorphisms in a homoplasmic distribution pattern. Mutant alleles were observed in all subjects with individual frequency rates of up to 95%. Thirteen mutant alleles in the d-loop region of mtDNA occurred with a high frequency. Novel alleles and locations were also identified in the d-loop of mtDNA as follows: 89 G insertions (40%), 95 G insertions (13%), 182 C/T substitutions (5%), 308 C insertions (19%), and 311 C insertions (80%).

Dysregulation of autophagy cellular death is common among a wide range of cancers and presents challenges to current treatment options. This review will evaluate current methods to directly and indirectly modulate autophagy to prevent cancer and to overcome resistance to anticancer therapy. METHODS: PubMed was searched for keywords: autophagy, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and cell death for preclinical and clinical studies evaluating autophagy-modulating pathways and compounds. Clinicaltrials.gov was searched for keywords: autophagy, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine for clinical trials involving autophagy. RESULTS: The pathways of autophagy are highly prevalent in numerous cancers cell types including leukemia, renal cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and advanced solid tumor. Autophagy-inducing compounds represent various drug classes and include everolimus, bortezomib, vorinostat, and arsenic trioxide. The autophagy-inhibiting compounds include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and bafilomycin. Clinicaltrials.gov search identified 32 currently ongoing clinical studies evaluating autophagy and included 14 and 3 studies involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, respectively. These phase I and phase II studies, evaluating the therapeutic benefit of combining autophagy modulators with current anticancer treatments, demonstrate early evidence for application in resistant cancer therapy. Despite positive results, there remains a need to identify direct-acting autophagy inhibitors and for larger phase III trials to be conducted. CONCLUSION: The preclinical evidence for modulating autophagy describes a promising, novel mechanism for enhancing anticancer treatments and overcoming current challenges such as chemotherapy resistance.","['Duffy, Alison', 'Le, Jackson', 'Sausville, Edward', 'Emadi, Ashkan']","['Duffy A', 'Le J', 'Sausville E', 'Emadi A']","['Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA, aduffy@rx.umaryland.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141125,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",2014/11/26 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2637-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Mar;75(3):439-47. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2637-z.

We and others have shown that kinase activity profiling is able to give more insights in active signal transduction pathways and point out interesting signaling hubs as well as new potential druggable targets. With this technique the gap between newly designed drugs and ALL may be bridged. The aim of this study was to perform kinome profiling on 20 pediatric ALL samples (14 BCP-ALL and six T-ALL) to identify signaling proteins relevant to ALL. We defined 250 peptides commonly activated in both BCP-ALL and T-ALL representing major signal transduction pathways including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and regulators of the cell cycle/p53 pathway. For 27 peptides, differentially phosphorylation between BCP-ALL and T-ALL was observed. Among these, ten peptides were more highly phosphorylated in BCP-ALL while 17 peptides showed increased phosphorylation in T-ALL. Furthermore we selected one lead of the list of commonly activated peptides (HGFR_Y1235) in order to test its efficacy as a potential target and provide proof of principle for this approach.

TLS is carried out by low-fidelity DNA polymerases that replicate across lesions, thereby preventing genome instability at the cost of increased point mutations. Here we perform a two-stage siRNA-based functional screen for mammalian TLS genes and identify 17 validated TLS genes. One of the genes, NPM1, is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We show that NPM1 (nucleophosmin) regulates TLS via interaction with the catalytic core of DNA polymerase-eta (poleta), and that NPM1 deficiency causes a TLS defect due to proteasomal degradation of poleta. Moreover, the prevalent NPM1c+ mutation that causes NPM1 mislocalization in ~30% of AML patients results in excessive degradation of poleta. These results establish the role of NPM1 as a key TLS regulator, and suggest a mechanism for the better prognosis of AML patients carrying mutations in NPM1.","['Ziv, Omer', 'Zeisel, Amit', 'Mirlas-Neisberg, Nataly', 'Swain, Umakanta', 'Nevo, Reinat', 'Ben-Chetrit, Nir', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Rossi, Roberta', 'Schiesser, Stefan', 'Canman, Christine E', 'Carell, Thomas', 'Geacintov, Nicholas E', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Domany, Eytan', 'Livneh, Zvi']","['Ziv O', 'Zeisel A', 'Mirlas-Neisberg N', 'Swain U', 'Nevo R', 'Ben-Chetrit N', 'Martelli MP', 'Rossi R', 'Schiesser S', 'Canman CE', 'Carell T', 'Geacintov NE', 'Falini B', 'Domany E', 'Livneh Z']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Biological Regulation, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Perugia 06100, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Perugia 06100, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich 81377, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich 81377, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, New York University, New York, New York 10003, USA.', 'Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Perugia 06100, Italy.', 'Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141125,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (Rad30 protein)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA Replication/radiation effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Binding', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2014/11/26 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms6437 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms6437 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Nov 25;5:5437. doi: 10.1038/ncomms6437.,,,['R01 CA133046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4263322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, failure of model adequacy could lead to severe bias in parameter estimation, and only a limited contribution has been made to check the model assumptions. In this paper, we present a class of analytical methods and graphical approaches for checking the assumptions of Fine and Gray's model. The proposed goodness-of-fit test procedures are based on the cumulative sums of residuals, which validate the model in three aspects: (1) proportionality of hazard ratio, (2) the linear functional form and (3) the link function. For each assumption testing, we provide a p-values and a visualized plot against the null hypothesis using a simulation-based approach. We also consider an omnibus test for overall evaluation against any model misspecification.

In this first large population-based study on secondary AML, we studied AML with an antecedent hematological disease (AHD-AML) or therapy-related AML (t-AML) in the population-based Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry. The study included 3,363 adult patients of which 2,474 (73.6%) had de novo AML, 630 (18.7%) AHD-AML, and 259 (7.7%) t-AML. Secondary AML differed significantly compared to de novo AML with respect to age, gender, and cytogenetic risk. Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower but early death rates similar in secondary AML. In a multivariable analysis, AHD-AML (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.26-1.79) and t-AML (1.72; 1.38-2.15) were independent risk factors for poor survival. The negative impact of AHD-AML and t-AML on survival was highly age dependent with a considerable impact in younger patients, but without independent prognostic value in the elderly. Although patients with secondary leukemia did poorly with intensive treatment, early death rates and survival were significantly worse with palliative treatment. We conclude that secondary AML in a population-based setting has a striking impact on survival in younger AML patients, whereas it lacks prognostic value among the elderly patients.","['Hulegardh, Erik', 'Nilsson, Christer', 'Lazarevic, Vladimir', 'Garelius, Hege', 'Antunovic, Petar', 'Rangert Derolf, Asa', 'Mollgard, Lars', 'Uggla, Bertil', 'Wennstrom, Lovisa', 'Wahlin, Anders', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Stockelberg, Dick', 'Lehmann, Soren']","['Hulegardh E', 'Nilsson C', 'Lazarevic V', 'Garelius H', 'Antunovic P', 'Rangert Derolf A', 'Mollgard L', 'Uggla B', 'Wennstrom L', 'Wahlin A', 'Hoglund M', 'Juliusson G', 'Stockelberg D', 'Lehmann S']","['Department of Medicine and Regional Tumor Registry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150116,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', '*Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', '*Registries', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Sweden']",2014/11/26 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23908 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Mar;90(3):208-14. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23908.

The compounds showed poor, if any, activity against a broad range of RNA and DNA viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This inactivity may be due to lack of an efficient metabolic conversion into their corresponding 5'-triphosphates and poor affinity for their target enzymes (DNA/RNA polymerases). Several compounds showed cytostatic activity against proliferating human CD4(+) T-lymphocyte CEM cells and against several other tumor cell lines, including murine leukemia L1210 and human prostate PC3, kidney CAKI-1, and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. A few compounds were inhibitory to Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) in C3H/3T3 cell cultures, with the 2,6-diaminotri-O-benzyl-D-allitolyl- and -D-altritolyl pyrimidine analogues being the most potent among them.

In recent years, also a renaissance of maintenance therapy after completion of intensive consolidation has been observed with the introduction of kinase inhibitors and demethylating agents in clinical trials. Greater insight into the genetic background of the disease fostered the extension of disease classification and pretreatment risk-categorization by gene mutations. In addition, the pre-treatment risk-defining parameters have been supplemented by markers evaluated at distinct time points during treatment and follow up. In this context, minimal residual disease assessment is increasingly used to dynamically fine tune treatment recommendations. Currently, the gold standard to counterbalance a higher risk of relapse by treatment strategies based on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with grafts from matched related or unrelated donors is still valuable, whereas autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation showed promising results especially in patients categorized as low-risk. Nonetheless, more targeted approaches including kinase inhibitors and demethylating agents in combination with or sequentially before or after intensive chemotherapy are currently in clinical evaluation and may lead to more genotype- instead of purely risk-adapted treatment strategies.","['Schlenk, Richard F']",['Schlenk RF'],"['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Retreatment', 'Risk Factors']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.114611 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.114611 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Nov;99(11):1663-70. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.114611.,,,,PMC4222459,,,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signaling of the RAS-GTPases through the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, the first identified mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is essential in development. A group of genetic syndromes, named ""RASopathies"", had been identified which are caused by heterozygosity for germline mutations in genes that encode protein components of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Several of these clinically overlapping disorders, including Noonan syndrome, Noonan-like CBL syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, neurofibromatosis type I, and Legius syndrome, predispose to cancer and abnormal myelopoiesis in infancy. This review focuses on juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a malignancy of early childhood characterized by initiating germline and/or somatic mutations in five genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway: PTPN11, CBL, NF-1, KRAS and NRAS. Natural courses of these five subtypes differ, although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative therapy option for most children with JMML. With whole-exome sequencing studies revealing few secondary lesions it will be crucial to better understand the RAS/MAPK signaling network with its crosstalks and feed-back loops to carefully design early clinical trials with novel pharmacological agents in this still puzzling leukemia.","['Niemeyer, Charlotte M']",['Niemeyer CM'],"['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Freiburg, Germany charlotte.niemeyer@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome', 'ras Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.114595 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.114595 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Nov;99(11):1653-62. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.114595.,,,,PMC4222471,,,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between initiation of 2GTKI versus 1GTKI and medication adherence, health services utilization, and healthcare costs. METHOD: This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing administrative claims data from a single health plan within the US of commercial and Medicare patients newly initiating 1GTKI or 2GTKI therapy for CML between June 2010 and December 2011. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the association between TKI therapy and adherence, defined as proportion of days covered >/=0.85. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models examined the association between TKI and health services utilization and direct healthcare costs (plan and patient paid) during the 12 month follow-up period. RESULTS: Among the 368 patients included, there was no difference in adherence between patients initiating a 2GTKI compared to a 1GTKI (odds ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.40). Initiating a 2GTKI was associated with increased outpatient visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.20); however, there were no statistically significant differences in emergency room visits or inpatient visits between the treatment groups. Total costs were 1.3 times higher for 2GTKI initiators versus 1GTKI initiators ($86,509 versus $66,443; p = 0.001), with a significant difference in TKI pharmacy costs. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no differences in adherence, hospitalizations, or emergency room visits among patients initiating a second- versus first-generation TKI, total all-cause costs and outpatient visits were higher for 2GTKI initiators. With the impending release of generic imatinib, these comparative data will become germane in the selection of a first-line TKI therapy. Because this study used claims from a single health plan, it may not be generalizable to the general population.","['Ward, Melea A', 'Fang, Gang', 'Richards, Kristy L', 'Walko, Christine M', 'Earnshaw, Stephanie R', 'Happe, Laura E', 'Blalock, Susan J']","['Ward MA', 'Fang G', 'Richards KL', 'Walko CM', 'Earnshaw SR', 'Happe LE', 'Blalock SJ']","['University of North Carolina, Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy , Chapel Hill, NC , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141210,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/economics/therapeutic use', '*Benzamides/economics/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/economics/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient Care/economics/methods/statistics & numerical data', '*Piperazines/economics/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Pyrimidines/economics/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Thiazoles/economics/therapeutic use', 'United States/epidemiology']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2014.991440 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2015 Feb;31(2):289-97. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.991440.

Previous study has established that this natural product primarily targets the complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

Here we report that (-)-8,9-dehydroneopeltolide (8,9-DNP), a more accessible synthetic analogue, shows potent cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells preferentially under energy stress conditions. Nuclear morphology analysis, as well as DNA ladder assay, indicated that 8,9-DNP induced significant nuclear condensation/fragmentation and DNA fragmentation, and these events could be suppressed by preincubating the cells with a pan-caspase inhibitor, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the cleavage of full-length caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results indicated that 8,9-DNP induced caspase-dependent apoptotic programmed cell death under energy stress conditions. It was also found that 8,9-DNP induced non-apoptotic cell death in the presence/absence of zVAD under energy stress conditions. Immunoblot analysis showed the intracytosolic release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), although it did not further translocate to the nucleus. It appears most likely that, in the presence of zVAD, 8,9-DNP triggered necrotic cell death as a result of severe intracellular ATP depletion.","['Fuwa, Haruhiko', 'Sato, Mizuho', 'Sasaki, Makoto']","['Fuwa H', 'Sato M', 'Sasaki M']","['Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577, Japan. hfuwa@m.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577, Japan. b3bm1016@s.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577, Japan. b3bm1016@s.tohoku.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141120,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (8,9-dehydroneopeltolide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrolides/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['md12115576 [pii]', '10.3390/md12115576 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2014 Nov 20;12(11):5576-89. doi: 10.3390/md12115576.,,,,PMC4245546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its potential significance of nucleoplasmic localizations remains greatly elusive. Here we demonstrate that PML interacts with LC3 in a cell type-independent manner as assessed by Co-IP assay and co-localization observation. Overexpressed PML significantly coprecipitates with endogenous and nuclear LC3 protein. Furthermore, a fraction of endogenous PML protein is found to be co-localized with LC3 protein under steady state condition, which is further enhanced by IFNalpha induction, indicating that PML up-regulation potentiates this interaction. Additionally, DsRed-PML associates with EGFP-LC3 during telophase and G1 phase but not in metaphase and anaphase. Two potential LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs in PML are required for interaction of PML with LC3 while this association is independent of autophagic activity. Finally, we show that interaction between PML and LC3 contributes to cell growth inhibition function of PML. Considering that PML is an important tumor suppressor, we propose that nuclear portion of LC3 protein may associate with PML to control cell growth for prevention and inhibition of cancer occurrence and development.","['He, Wei', 'Hu, Chuan-Xi', 'Hou, Jia-Kai', 'Fan, Li', 'Xu, Yi-Wei', 'Liu, Man-Hua', 'Yan, Shu-Yang', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Huang, Ying']","['He W', 'Hu CX', 'Hou JK', 'Fan L', 'Xu YW', 'Liu MH', 'Yan SY', 'Chen GQ', 'Huang Y']","['Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China; Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141124,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Atg5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phagosomes/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA Interference', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0113089 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-13556 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 24;9(11):e113089. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0113089. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4242537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to assess temporal trends in reporting delay by cancer site from 1999-2010. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 9 cancer registries and the New York State Cancer Registry, I calculated short-, medium-, and long-term delay for the most common cancer sites for each year and identified the linear trend. Nearly all sites showed a decrease in delay over the period, and many showed a statistically significant decrease. The decrease in delay was more pronounced in the New York State data. These findings reflect long-term improvement in the timeliness of cancer reporting, but there remains room for improvement. Leukemia and myeloma are especially problematic, as these sites are heavily dependent on reporting by private physicians.","['Boscoe, Francis P']",['Boscoe FP'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Registry Manag,Journal of registry management,9804163,,IM,"['Incidence', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Research Design/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Distribution', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/06/03 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Registry Manag. 2014 Fall;41(3):135-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CDC established 10 specialized registries within the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) to enhance data collection for all cancers and to address targeted CER questions, including the clinical use and prognostic value of specific biomarkers. The project also included a special focus on detailed first course of treatment for cancers of the breast, colon, and rectum, as well as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) diagnosed in 2011.

We observed the bone marrow CD123/CD117/CD34/HLA-DR antigen expression in 64 elderly patients with acute leukemia (AL). METHODS: The immune phenotypes of 64 elderly AL patients were detected and the correlations of CD123, HLA-DR, CD34 and CD117 expression with the leukemia cell morphology were analyzed. The cell genetics, molecular biology and the prognostic stratification were compared based on flow cytometry. RESULTS: In CDl23-positive patients, the complete remission (CR) rate was 21.5%. In CDl23-negative patients, the CR rate was 59.1%. The CR rate was 21.9% in HLA-DR-positive patients and 43.8% in HLA-DR-negative patients. The CR rate was 24.0% in CD34-positive patients and 41.1% in CD34-negative patients. The CR rate was 29.0% in CD117-positive patients and 42.3% in CD117-negative patients. The CR rate was 34.4% in CD38-positive patients and 0.00% in CD38-negative patients.

The use of L-asparaginase may be limited by serious adverse events of which allergy is the most frequent. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical aspects of PEG-asparaginase allergy in children treated according to the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol. PROCEDURE: Children (1-17 years) enrolled in the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol between July 2008 and August 2011, who developed PEG-asparaginase allergy were identified through the NOPHO ALL2008 toxicity registry. In the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol, patients are randomized to 8 or 15 doses of intramuscular PEG-asparaginase (Oncaspar(R)) 1,000 IU/m(2) /dose administered at 2 or 6 weeks intervals during a total period of 30 weeks. (Clinical trials.gov no: NCT00819351). RESULTS: Of 615 evaluable patients, 79 patients developed clinical PEG-asparaginase allergy (cumulative risk; 13.2%) and discontinued PEG-asparaginase therapy for that reason. PEG-asparaginase allergy occurred after a median of two doses (75% range 2-4, max 14). In 58% of PEG-asparaginase hypersensitive patients, the clinical allergic reactions appeared within 2 hr after PEG-asparaginase administration and ranged from mild symptoms to systemic anaphylaxis. Nine patients experienced an anaphylactic reaction within 1 hr and 50 min from asparaginase administration; none were fatal. Four of 68 patients (6%) who subsequently received Erwinase therapy also reacted allergic to Erwinase. CONCLUSION: Clinical allergy to PEG-asparaginase occurred early in treatment, was in general moderate in severity, and mostly developed within 2 hr after PEG-asparaginase administration. The risk of subsequent Erwinase allergic reactions was low.","['Henriksen, Louise Tram', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Pruunsild, Kaie', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda', 'Jonsson, Olafur Gisli', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Schroder, Henrik', 'Albertsen, Birgitte Klug']","['Henriksen LT', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Ruud E', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Pruunsild K', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Jonsson OG', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Heyman M', 'Schroder H', 'Albertsen BK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141121,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anaphylaxis/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25319 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Mar;62(3):427-33. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25319.

More specifically, research has demonstrated that it plays an essential role in the self-renewal of leukemic stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This review will cover clinical aspects of AML, the role of epigenetics in the disease, and discuss the research that led to the first irreversible inhibitors of LSD1 entering clinical trials for the treatment of AML in 2014. We also review recent achievements and progress in the development of potent and selective reversible inhibitors of LSD1. These compounds differ in their mode of action from tranylcypromine derivatives and could facilitate novel biochemical studies to probe the pathways mediated by LSD1. In this review, we will critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of published series of reversible LSD1 inhibitors. Overall, while the development of reversible inhibitors to date has been less fruitful than that of irreversible inhibitors, there is still the possibility for their use to facilitate further research into the roles and functions of LSD1 and to expand the therapeutic applications of LSD1 inhibitors in the clinic.","['Mould, Daniel P', 'McGonagle, Alison E', 'Wiseman, Daniel H', 'Williams, Emma L', 'Jordan, Allan M']","['Mould DP', 'McGonagle AE', 'Wiseman DH', 'Williams EL', 'Jordan AM']","['Department of Drug Discovery, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141124,United States,Med Res Rev,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polyamines)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Demethylases/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lysine/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/chemistry', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/med.21334 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Res Rev. 2015 May;35(3):586-618. doi: 10.1002/med.21334.

Alternative splicing at two sites yields four major isoforms, 17AA(+)KTS(+), 17AA(+)KTS(-), 17AA(-)KTS(+), and 17AA(-)KTS(-), and all the isoforms are expressed in the malignancies. However, among the four isoforms, function of WT1[17AA(-)KTS(+)] isoform still remains undetermined. In the present study, we showed that forced expression of WT1[17AA(-)KTS(+)] isoform significantly inhibited apoptosis by DNA-damaging agents such as Doxorubicin, Mitomycin, Camptothesisn, and Bleomycin in immortalized fibroblast MRC5SV and cervical cancer HeLa cells. Knockdown of Rad51, an essential factor for homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair canceled the resistance to Doxorubicin induced by WT1[17AA(-)KTS(+)] isoform. GFP recombination assay showed that WT1[17AA(-)KTS(+)] isoform alone promoted HR, but that three other WT1 isoforms did not. WT1[17AA(-)KTS(+)] isoform significantly upregulated the expression of HR genes, XRCC2, Rad51D, and Rad54. Knockdown of XRCC2, Rad51D, and Rad54 inhibited the HR activity and canceled resistance to Doxorubicin in MRC5SV cells with forced expression of WT1[17AA(-)KTS(+)] isoform. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed the binding of WT1[17AA(-)KTS(+)] isoform protein to promoters of XRCC2 and Rad51D. Immunohistochemical study showed that Rad54 and XRCC2 proteins were highly expressed in the majority of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastric cancer, and that expression of these two proteins was significantly correlated with that of WT1 protein in NSCLCs. Our results presented here showed that WT1[17AA(-)KTS(+)] isoform had a function to promote HR-mediated DNA repair.","['Oji, Yusuke', 'Tatsumi, Naoya', 'Kobayashi, Junya', 'Fukuda, Mari', 'Ueda, Tazu', 'Nakano, Eri', 'Saito, Chisae', 'Shibata, Syohei', 'Sumikawa, Mihoko', 'Fukushima, Hisashi', 'Saito, Akari', 'Hojo, Nozomi', 'Suzuki, Miyu', 'Hoshikawa, Tomoko', 'Shimura, Tsutomu', 'Morii, Eiichi', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Komatsu, Kenshi', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Oji Y', 'Tatsumi N', 'Kobayashi J', 'Fukuda M', 'Ueda T', 'Nakano E', 'Saito C', 'Shibata S', 'Sumikawa M', 'Fukushima H', 'Saito A', 'Hojo N', 'Suzuki M', 'Hoshikawa T', 'Shimura T', 'Morii E', 'Oka Y', 'Hosen N', 'Komatsu K', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Environmental Health, National Institute of Public Health, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141121,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RAD51D protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '0 (XRCC2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (RAD54L protein, human)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA Helicases/genetics', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Homologous Recombination/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2014/11/25 06:00,2016/01/23 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.22248 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2015 Dec;54(12):1758-71. doi: 10.1002/mc.22248.

Here, we used lentivirally mediated expression of a dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS (IK6) to block normal IKAROS activity in primitive human cord blood cells and their progeny. This produced a marked (10-fold) increase in serially transplantable multipotent IK6(+) cells as well as increased outputs of normally differentiating B cells and granulocytes in transplanted immunodeficient mice, without producing leukemia. Accompanying T/natural killer (NK) cell outputs were unaltered, and erythroid and platelet production was reduced. Mechanistically, IK6 specifically increased human granulopoietic progenitor sensitivity to two growth factors and activated CREB and its targets (c-FOS and Cyclin B1). In more primitive human cells, IK6 prematurely initiated a B cell transcriptional program without affecting the hematopoietic stem cell-associated gene expression profile. Some of these effects were species specific, thus identifying novel roles of IKAROS in regulating normal human hematopoietic cells.","['Beer, Philip A', 'Knapp, David J H F', 'Kannan, Nagarajan', 'Miller, Paul H', 'Babovic, Sonja', 'Bulaeva, Elizabeth', 'Aghaeepour, Nima', 'Rabu, Gabrielle', 'Rostamirad, Shabnam', 'Shih, Kingsley', 'Wei, Lisa', 'Eaves, Connie J']","['Beer PA', 'Knapp DJ', 'Kannan N', 'Miller PH', 'Babovic S', 'Bulaeva E', 'Aghaeepour N', 'Rabu G', 'Rostamirad S', 'Shih K', 'Wei L', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.

Governance of mTORC2 activity is poorly understood. Here, we report a transmembrane molecule in hematopoietic progenitor cells that physically interacts with and inhibits RICTOR, an essential component of mTORC2. Upstream of mTORC2 (UT2) negatively regulates mTORC2 enzymatic activity, reducing AKT(S473), PKCalpha, and NDRG1 phosphorylation and increasing FOXO transcriptional activity in an mTORC2-dependent manner. Modulating UT2 levels altered animal survival in a T cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL) model that is known to be mTORC2 sensitive.

It is defined by the presence of 2 x 10(9)/L peripheral blood plasma cells or plasmacytosis accounting for more than 20 % of the differential white cell count. PCL presents more often extramedullary involvement, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, as well as impaired renal function. Cytogenetic abnormalities and mutations observed in PCL lead to escape from immune surveillance and independence from the bone marrow microenvironment with changes in expression of adhesion molecules or chemokines receptors. The outcome of PCL has improved with combination approaches with novel agents (including bortezomib and immunomodulatory drugs, such as lenalidomide) and with autologous stem cell transplantation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently available for young patients.

In particular, it is important to understand the mechanisms responsible for potential upregulation of proto-oncogenic growth factor expressions by inflammatory mediators. Here, we investigated the ability of the highly inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) to induce the production of stem cell factor (SCF), which is a major hematopoietic growth factor that controls the progression of acute myeloid leukaemia upon malignant transformation of haematopoietic myeloid cells. We found that human IL-1beta induced the expression/secretion of SCF in MCF-7 human epithelial breast cancer cells and that this process depended on the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription complex. We also demonstrated a crucial role of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in IL-1beta-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation in MCF-7 cells. Importantly, mTOR was also found to play a role in IL-1beta-induced SCF production. Furthermore, a tendency for a positive correlation of IL-1beta and SCF levels in the plasma of healthy human donors was observed. Altogether, our results demonstrate that IL-1beta, which normally bridges innate and adaptive immunity, induces the production of the major haematopoietic/proleukaemic growth factor SCF through the PI-3K/mTOR pathway and the HIF-1 transcription complex. These findings strongly support a cross-talk between inflammation and acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Wyszynski, Rafal W', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Varani, Luca', 'Iannotta, Daniela', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Wyszynski RW', 'Gibbs BF', 'Varani L', 'Iannotta D', 'Sumbayev VV']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Kent, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Kent, UK.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Kent, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141124,China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/*immunology/pharmacology', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics/*immunology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2014/11/25 06:00,2016/09/28 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['cmi2014113 [pii]', '10.1038/cmi.2014.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2016 Jan;13(1):47-56. doi: 10.1038/cmi.2014.113.

PROCEDURE: We retrospectively analyzed very early lymphocyte subset counts following transplantation from our 5-year pediatric allogeneic HSCT material to find clinically relevant associations with post transplant outcome, and the major complication of HSCT, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). We analyzed HSCTs performed due to acute leukemias and lymphomas from matched unrelated donors (MUD, n = 33), unrelated cord blood (UCB, n = 9) and matched sibling donors (MSD, n = 17). RESULTS: Patients with grafts from MUDs and grade II-IV aGVHD) had higher (median 2.1 compared to 0.3, P<0.0001) and earlier (at day +18 post transplant vs. day +25, P = 0.004) first measurable CD4(+) /CD8(+) T cell ratio, compared to patients with no or grade I aGVHD, respectively. At day +32 after HSCT patients with MUDs and significant aGVHD had higher levels of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. Low (below median 120/microL) versus high natural killer (NK) cell counts at day +32 were associated with 3-year event-free survival of 27.4 +/- 9.0% versus 82.4 +/- 6.4% (P < 0.0001), cumulative transplant-related mortality of 44.7 +/- 12.2% versus 3.0 +/- 3.0% (P < 0.001) and cumulative relapse incidence of 50.4 +/- 12.2% versus 15.0 +/- 6.2% (P = 0.019), respectively.

METHODS: Expression and promoter methylation of miR-720 were determined by quantitive PCR and pyrosequencing in 38 patients with AML and 20 normal controls. Lentivirous-mediated miR-702 overexpression was constructed in AML cell line kasumi-1. The cell proliferation, apoptosis, cycle, colony formation, migration and P53-mediated apoptosis pathway were determined. RESULTS: AML patients showed significantly lower miR-720 expression compared with normal controls (0.69+/-0.09 vs 3.00+/-0.46, P<0.01); The methylation level of miR-720 promoter region in AML patients were significantly higher than normal controls [(75.56+/-2.35)% vs (47.65+/-2.78)%, P<0.01]. miR-720 overexpression in kasumi-1 cells induced significantly increased cell apoptosis (P=0.017), elevated apoptosis sensitivity to etoposide (P=0.004), and reduced cell proliferation (P<0.01). miR-720 overexpression also induced reduced colony formation (P=0.005), cell cycle arrest in G(1)/G(0) phase and decreased migration ability in kasumi-1 cells. In addition, overexpression of miR-720 significantly induced increased cell apoptosis-related proteins including P53 and Bax, and activation of NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway. After kasumi-1 cells were treated with 1uM decitabine for 48 hours, miR-720 promoter methylation reduced significantly, and miR-720 expression significantly increased. CONCLUSION: The expression of miR-720 in AML patients reduced significantly, and DNA methylation-mediated epigenetic silencing of miR-720 contributed to maintain the malignant characteristics of AML.","['Tang, Shanhao', 'Pei, Renzhi', 'Li, Kongfei', 'Ma, Junxia', 'Zhang, Peisheng', 'Lu, Ying', 'Liu, Xuhui', 'DU, Xiaohong', 'Chen, Dong', 'Sha, Keya', 'Cao, Junjie', 'Li, Shuangyue']","['Tang S', 'Pei R', 'Li K', 'Ma J', 'Zhang P', 'Lu Y', 'Liu X', 'DU X', 'Chen D', 'Sha K', 'Cao J', 'Li S']","['Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo315040, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.11.013 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Nov;35(11):1009-12. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.11.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The results of 167 patients with newly diagnosed AEL, from January 2003 and June 2013 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, were reviewed by MICM. RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis indicated that CD13(96.1%), CD33(95.1%), CD117(87.4%) and CD34 (79.4%) were highly expressed in AEL. 56 of 148 (37.8%) AEL patients had a variety of cytogenetic abnormalities, 27 of 148(18.2%) patients were complex karyotype (abnormalities involving 3 or more chromosomes), the abnormalities of chromosomes 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more frequently involved and the most common one was 8, accounting for 35.7% of all abnormal karyotype, followed by 5q- (17.9%). Mutation analysis showed CEBPA mutation ratio of AEL patients was 44.0% (11/25), that of NPM1 as 15.4% (4/26). Initial induced remission rate of AEL was 56.6% (30/53), compared by 33.3% (4/12) of MDSM6. Survival analysis showed that the overall survival in female was better than that in male (P=0.047). The overall survival time of transplantation group is significantly longer than chemotherapy group (P=0.000). The OS of 13-39 years old group was the best, 40-49 years old group took second place, >50 years old group appeared to be the worst. CONCLUSION: AEL had its own unique biological features, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could significantly improve its poor prognosis.","['Cheng, Wenxiu', 'Sun, Aining', 'Chen, Suning', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Yin, Jia', ""Ping, Na'na"", 'Wang, Qian', 'Wu, Depei']","['Cheng W', 'Sun A', 'Chen S', 'Qiu H', 'Yin J', 'Ping N', 'Wang Q', 'Wu D']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University215006, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University215006, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University215006, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University215006, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University215006, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University215006, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University215006, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University215006, Suzhou, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,['Acute erythroleukemia'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.11.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Nov;35(11):970-3. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.11.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Totally 79 patients with MDS/AML were divided into three groups: (1)Treated with decitabine alone (20 mg/m(2) for 5 days). (2) Combination of decitabine with half dose CAG chemotherapy (Acla 20 mg qodx3 d, Ara-C 10 mg/m(2) q12 hx7 d, G-CSF 300 mug/d, the dose of G-CSF adjust to the amount of blood routine). (3)Combination of decitabine with CAG chemotherapy (Acla 20 mg qodx4 d, Ara-C 10 mg/m(2) q12 hx14 d, G-CSF 300 mug/d, the dose of G-CSF adjust to the amount of blood routine). We observed complete remission (CR) rate, overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) of the three groups; meanwhile, we analyzed the factors relevant to decitabine efficacy and the prognosis. RESULTS: ORR in the three groups were 53.3%, 56.5% and 69.2% respectively, with no statistically significant differences (P>0.05). Due to the last follow-up at 2014.04.01, 20 patients still survived, 45 died, 14 were lost to follow-up. The 5-year cumulative survival rate of 79 patients was 25.3%, the 2-year survival were of the three groups were 34.8%, 24.8 and 29.2% respectively with no statistically significant differences (P>0.05). Adverse events of infection and bleeding were mainly caused by decitabine. Grade 3 to 4 hematological toxicities were observed in 72 cases with the average time for the lack of granulocytes as 14.8 days. 59 patients experienced infectious events, including grade 3 or 4 infections in 14 cases, grade 1 or 2 infections in 45 cases. There were no statistically significant differences (P>0.05) among the three groups in terms of infection rates, bleeding rates, duration of neutrophenia, mean MAP transfusion and mean platelet transfusion. 79 patients were safely through bone marrow suppression by anti-infective and supportive treatment without treatment-related deaths.

One hundred sixty-four out of 171 patients (96 %) received preemptive therapy. The median duration of CMV reactivation was 29 days. In multivariate analysis, weight >22 kg, use of total body irradiation, use of pre-transplant antithymocyte globulin, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with mycophenolate mofetil, and presence of grade II-IV acute GVHD were independent predictors of CMV reactivation. CMV reactivation did not impact transplantation-related mortality (TRM), leukemia relapse, or survival. CMV disease was diagnosed in 62 patients (17.8 %) at a median 55 days after UCBT.

However, to the best of our knowledge, these findings have seldom been examined in large population-based cohort studies, and the specific contributions of gestational age and fetal growth remain unknown. METHODS: The authors conducted a national cohort study of 3,569,333 individuals without Down syndrome who were born in Sweden between 1973 and 2008 and followed for the incidence of ALL through 2010 (maximum age, 38 years) to examine perinatal and familial risk factors. RESULTS: There were 1960 ALL cases with 69.7 million person-years of follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, risk factors for ALL included high fetal growth (incidence rate ratio [IRR] per additional 1 standard deviation, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02-1.11 [P =.002]; and IRR for large vs appropriate for gestational age, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.40 [P =.005]), first-degree family history of ALL (IRR, 7.41; 95% CI, 4.60-11.95 [P<.001]), male sex (IRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10-1.31 [P<.001]), and parental country of birth (IRR for both parents born in Sweden vs other countries, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.27 [P =.045]). These risk factors did not appear to vary by patient age at the time of diagnosis of ALL. Gestational age at birth, season of birth, birth order, multiple birth, parental age, and parental education level were not found to be associated with ALL. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study, high fetal growth was found to be associated with an increased risk of ALL in childhood through young adulthood, independent of gestational age at birth, suggesting that growth factor pathways may play an important long-term role in the etiology of ALL.","['Crump, Casey', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Sieh, Weiva', 'Winkleby, Marilyn A', 'Sundquist, Kristina']","['Crump C', 'Sundquist J', 'Sieh W', 'Winkleby MA', 'Sundquist K']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141121,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Birth Order', 'Birth Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Fetal Development', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Maternal Age', 'Perinatal Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29172 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Apr 1;121(7):1040-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29172.

Scant data exist on the factors that increase the risk of ATE/VTE in patients with prostate cancer. The authors investigated the association of bevacizumab treatment and clinical factors with ATE/VTE risk in patients who were treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 90401. METHODS: Patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were randomized to receive docetaxel and prednisone with or without bevacizumab once every 21 days. Cycle-to-event Cox regression models were used to investigate the association of bevacizumab with the incidence of grade 3 or greater (>/= 3) ATE and VTE. Age, prior ATE/VTE, baseline antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, and VTE risk score (based on leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, body mass index, and tumor location) were evaluated in univariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Of 1008 randomized patients, the odds of experiencing grade >/= 3 ATE were significantly greater in those who received bevacizumab compared with those who received placebo (odds ratio, 2.79; P = .02), whereas an opposite trend was noted for grade >/= 3 VTE (odds ratio, 0.60; P = .08). In the multivariable analysis, bevacizumab treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 3.00; P = .01) and age (HR, 1.06; P = .02) were significantly associated with the risk of ATE; whereas age (HR, 1.05; P = .01) and VTE risk score (HR, 1.83; P = .03) were significantly associated with the risk of VTE. CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab was significantly associated with a greater risk of ATE in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, but it was not significantly associated with the risk of VTE. Understanding clinical factors that increase the risk for experiencing ATE/VTE is essential to mitigate the risks and reduce the burden of these prevalent complications in cancer care.","['Patel, Jai N', 'Jiang, Chen', 'Hertz, Daniel L', 'Mulkey, Flora A', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Friedman, Paula N', 'Small, Eric J', 'Carducci, Michael A', 'Mahoney, John F', 'Kelley, Michael J', 'Morris, Michael J', 'Kelly, William K', 'McLeod, Howard L']","['Patel JN', 'Jiang C', 'Hertz DL', 'Mulkey FA', 'Owzar K', 'Halabi S', 'Ratain MJ', 'Friedman PN', 'Small EJ', 'Carducci MA', 'Mahoney JF', 'Kelley MJ', 'Morris MJ', 'Kelly WK', 'McLeod HL']","['Levine Cancer Institute, Carolinas HealthCare System, Charlotte, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141121,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Arteries/*pathology', 'Bevacizumab', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Docetaxel', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Survival Rate', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage', 'Thromboembolism/classification/*etiology', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*etiology']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29169 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Apr 1;121(7):1025-31. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29169.

However, the signaling pathways and mechanisms that regulate STAT3 activation remain to be elucidated. METHODS: In this study we took advantage of existing cellular models for chronic myeloid leukemia resistance, western blot, in vitro signaling, real time PCR, flow cytometry approaches for cell cycle and apoptosis evaluation and siRNA assay in order to investigate the possible relationship between STATIP1, STAT3 and CML resistance. RESULTS: Here, we report the characterization of STAT3 protein regulation by STAT3-interacting protein (STATIP1) in the leukemia cell line K562, which demonstrates constitutive BCR-ABL TK activity. K562 cells exhibit high levels of phosphorylated STAT3 accumulated in the nucleus and enhanced BCR-ABL-dependent STAT3 transcriptional activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that STATIP1 is not involved in either BCR-ABL or STAT3 signaling but that STATIP1 is involved in the down-regulation of STAT3 transcription levels; STATIP1-depleted K562 cells display increased proliferation and increased levels of the anti-apoptosis STAT3 target genes CCND1 and BCL-XL, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Lucena, an Imatinib (IM)-resistant cell line, exhibits lower STATIP1 mRNA levels and undergoes apoptosis/cell cycle arrest in response to STAT3 inhibition together with IM treatment. We provide evidence that STATIP1 siRNA could confer therapy resistance in the K562 cells. Moreover, analysis of CML patients showed an inverse expression of STAIP1 and STAT3 mRNA levels, ratifying that IM-resistant patients present low STATIP1/high STAT3 mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that STATIP1 may be a negative regulator of STAT3 and demonstrate its involvement in IM therapy resistance in CML.","['Mencalha, Andre L', 'Correa, Stephany', 'Salles, Daniela', 'Du Rocher, Barbara', 'Santiago, Marcelo F', 'Abdelhay, Eliana']","['Mencalha AL', 'Correa S', 'Salles D', 'Du Rocher B', 'Santiago MF', 'Abdelhay E']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. andre.mencalha@uerj.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141123,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (ELP2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/08/21 06:00,['2014/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-866 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-866 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Nov 23;14:866. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-866.,,,,PMC4258947,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors (CKIs) regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, regeneration after cytotoxic stress and tumor cell proliferation. We thus studied the role of Cks1 in HSC and in a prototypic stem cell disorder, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cks1 transcript was highly expressed in Lin-Sca-1+Kit+ (LSK) HSC, and the loss resulted in accumulation of the SCF(Skp2)/Cks1 substrates p21, p27, p57 and p130 particularly in CD150+ LSK cells. This accumulation correlated with decreased proliferation and accumulation of Cks1(-/-) HSC, slower regeneration after stress and prolonged HSC quiescence. At the hematopoietic progenitor (HPC) level, loss of Cks1 sensitized towards apoptosis. In CML, Cks1 expression was increased, and treatment with the Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, reduced Cks1 expression. Also, we found that Cks1 is critical for Bcr-Abl-induced cytokine-independent clonogenic activity. In conclusion, our study presents a novel function of Cks1 in maintaining HSC/HPC homeostasis and shows that Cks1 is a possible target in therapies aimed at the SCF(Skp2)/Cks1 complex that controls CKI abundance and cancer cell proliferation.","['Tomiatti, V', 'Istvanffy, R', 'Pietschmann, E', 'Kratzat, S', 'Hoellein, A', 'Quintanilla-Fend, L', 'von Bubnoff, N', 'Peschel, C', 'Oostendorp, R A J', 'Keller, U']","['Tomiatti V', 'Istvanffy R', 'Pietschmann E', 'Kratzat S', 'Hoellein A', 'Quintanilla-Fend L', 'von Bubnoff N', 'Peschel C', 'Oostendorp RA', 'Keller U']","['III.

Monitoring AYA cancer survival is of interest because of the lack of improvement in outcome previously documented for these patients as compared with younger and older patient outcomes. AYA patients 15-39 years old, diagnosed during 2000-2008 with malignant cancers were selected from the SEER 17 registries data. Selected cancers were analyzed for incidence and five-year relative survival by histology, stage, and receptor subtypes. Hazard ratios were estimated for cancer death risk among younger and older ages relative to the AYA group. AYA survival was worse for female breast cancer (regardless of estrogen receptor status), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AYA survival for AML was lowest for a subtype associated with a mutation of the nucleophosmin 1 gene (NPM1). AYA survival for breast cancer and leukemia remain poor as compared with younger and older survivors.

Pbx1 is required to maintain stem cell self-renewal, including that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have immunosuppressive functions that require stem cell maintenance. We tested the hypothesis that the expression of Pbx1-d favors MSC differentiation and impairs their immunosuppressive functions. We demonstrate that Sle1a1 MSCs express high levels of Pbx1-d as compared with congenic C57BL/6J (B6) MSCs. Sle1a1 MSCs grew faster and differentiated significantly more rapidly into osteoblasts than did B6 MSCs. This corresponded to a significant decrease in the expression of genes associated with stemness and an increase in the expression of genes associated with differentiation. Additionally, Sle1a1 MSCs express a gene expression profile associated with an enhanced innate immunity and inflammation. Suppression of Ig production from TLR-activated B6 B cells and IL-2 secretion from activated B6 CD4+ T cells was significantly impaired in Sle1a1 MSCs as compared with B6 MSCs. B6.Sle1a1 MSCs showed intermediate activity in suppressing lupus immunophenotypes in three different mouse models. Taken together, these data suggest that the expression of the lupus susceptibility allele Pbx1-d isoform impairs MSC functions, which may contribute to lupus pathogenesis both through a defective immunosuppression and the promotion of a proinflammatory environment.","['Lu, Shun', 'Zeumer, Leilani', 'Sorensen, Heather', 'Yang, Hong', 'Ng, Yunfai', 'Yu, Fahong', 'Riva, Alberto', 'Croker, Byron', 'Wallet, Shannon', 'Morel, Laurence']","['Lu S', 'Zeumer L', 'Sorensen H', 'Yang H', 'Ng Y', 'Yu F', 'Riva A', 'Croker B', 'Wallet S', 'Morel L']","['Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Department of Periodontology, Department of Oral Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Bioinformatic Core, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Bioinformatic Core, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Department of Periodontology, Department of Oral Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmunity/genetics/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptors/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2014/11/25 06:00,2016/02/27 06:00,['2014/11/23 06:00'],"['2014/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1401851 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1401851 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Jan 1;194(1):43-55. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401851.,,,['R01 AI045050/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By blocking cAMP degradation, type 4 cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE4) inhibitors activate cAMP-mediated signaling and induce apoptosis in CLL cells. In this study, we show that autologous irradiated leukemic cells induce proliferation in CLL cells and that such proliferation is blocked by a TLR7/8/9 inhibitor, by DNase, and by the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram. Rolipram also inhibited CLL cell proliferation induced by synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 agonists, as well as TLR agonist-induced costimulatory molecule expression and TNF-a (but not IL-6 or IL-10) production. Whereas treatment with a TLR9 agonist protected IgH V region unmutated, but not mutated, CLL cells from apoptosis, PDE4 inhibitors augmented apoptosis in both subtypes, suggesting that cAMP-mediated signaling may abrogate a TLR9-mediated survival signal in prognostically unfavorable IGHV unmutated CLL cells. Rolipram inhibited both TLR7/8- and TLR9-induced IFN regulatory factor 5 and NF-kB p65 nuclear translocation. PDE4 inhibitors also blocked TLR signaling in normal human immune cells. In PBMC and CD14-positive monocytes, PDE4 inhibitors blocked IFN-a or TNF-a (but not IL-6) production, respectively, following stimulation with synthetic TLR agonists or RNA-containing immune complexes. These results suggest that PDE4 inhibitors may be of clinical utility in CLL or autoimmune diseases that are driven by TLR-mediated signaling.","['Tan, Ying', 'Watkins, Amanda A', 'Freeman, Benjamin B', 'Meyers, John A', 'Rifkin, Ian R', 'Lerner, Adam']","['Tan Y', 'Watkins AA', 'Freeman BB', 'Meyers JA', 'Rifkin IR', 'Lerner A']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118', 'Section of Nephrology, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118', 'Section of Nephrology, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118 and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TLR8 protein, human)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 8)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Rolipram/*pharmacology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Toll-Like Receptor 8/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",2014/11/25 06:00,2016/02/27 06:00,['2014/11/23 06:00'],"['2014/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1401854 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1401854 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Jan 1;194(1):101-12. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401854.,,,"['P01 AR050256/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007501/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4333002,['NIHMS638612'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated uptake of benzene in hookah smokers and non-smokers attending hookah social events in naturalistic settings where hookah tobacco was smoked exclusively. METHODS: We quantified S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), a metabolite of benzene, in the urine of 105 hookah smokers and 103 non-smokers. Participants provided spot urine samples the morning of and the morning after attending an indoor hookah-only smoking social event at a hookah lounge or in a private home. RESULTS: Urinary SPMA levels in hookah smokers increased significantly following a hookah social event (P < 0.001). This increase was 4.2 times higher after hookah lounge events (P < 0.001) and 1.9 times higher after home events (P = 0.003). In non-smokers, urinary SPMA levels increased 2.6 times after hookah lounge events (P = 0.055); however, similar urinary SPMA levels were detected before and after home events, possibly indicating chronic exposure to benzene (P = 0.933). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first evidence for uptake of benzene in hookah smokers and non-smokers exposed to hookah tobacco secondhand smoke at social events in private homes compared with their counterparts in hookah lounges. Hookah tobacco smoke is a source of benzene exposure, a risk factor for leukemia. IMPACT: Because there is no safe level of exposure to benzene, our results call for interventions to reduce or prevent hookah tobacco use, regulatory actions to limit hookah-related exposure to toxicants including benzene, initiate labeling of hookah-related products, and include hookah smoking in clean indoor air legislation.","['Kassem, Nada O F', 'Kassem, Noura O', 'Jackson, Sheila R', 'Liles, Sandy', 'Daffa, Reem M', 'Zarth, Adam T', 'Younis, Maram A', 'Carmella, Steven G', 'Hofstetter, C Richard', 'Chatfield, Dale A', 'Matt, Georg E', 'Hecht, Stephen S', 'Hovell, Melbourne F']","['Kassem NO', 'Kassem NO', 'Jackson SR', 'Liles S', 'Daffa RM', 'Zarth AT', 'Younis MA', 'Carmella SG', 'Hofstetter CR', 'Chatfield DA', 'Matt GE', 'Hecht SS', 'Hovell MF']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Tobacco Use Disorder']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/08/12 06:00,['2014/11/23 06:00'],"['2014/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-14-0576 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0576 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2014 Dec;23(12):2793-809. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0576.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chilblains can be classified into primary and secondary forms. The primary or idiopathic form is not associated with an underlying disease and is clinically indistinguishable from the secondary form. The secondary form is associated with an underlying condition such as connective tissue disease, monoclonal gammopathy, cryoglobulinemia, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Histopathology cannot accurately help distinguish the primary from secondary forms of chilblains. This article will raise the awareness of chilblains by presenting two unusual case reports of chilblains in men from Southern California with discussion of the appropriate evaluation and treatment of this condition. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Case 1: A 56-year-old Caucasian man presented in January to a Southern California primary care clinic with a report of tingling and burning in both feet, followed by bluish discoloration and swelling as well as blistering. He had no unusual cold exposure prior to the onset of his symptoms. He had a history of ""white attacks"" in his hands consistent with Raynaud's phenomenon. His symptoms gradually resolved over a 3-week period. Case 2: A 53-year-old Caucasian man also presented to a Southern California clinic in January with a 3-week history of painful tingling in his toes, and subsequent purplish-black discoloration of the toes in both feet. His symptoms occurred 1 week after a skiing trip. He had partial improvement with warming measures. His symptoms resolved 2 weeks after his initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Chilblains is a relatively uncommon entity in warmer climates but can present during the winter months. Primary care providers in warmer climates such as Southern California in the USA may be unfamiliar with its presentation. It can be diagnosed clinically by the appearance of typical lesions during the cold damp season. Through a thorough history, physical examination and selected laboratory evaluation, underlying connective tissue disease or a mimic such as vasculitis or cutaneous leukemia can be excluded.","['Gordon, Rebecca', 'Arikian, Anne M', 'Pakula, Anita S']","['Gordon R', 'Arikian AM', 'Pakula AS']","['UCLA Department of Family Medicine Family Health Center, 1920 Colorado Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90404, USA. aarikian@mednet.ucla.edu.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20141122,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,"['California', 'Chilblains/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/*pathology']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/11/23 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-1947-8-381 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-8-381 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2014 Nov 22;8:381. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-8-381.,,,,PMC4275761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past studies in mice revealed Dnmt3a-knockout (KO)hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) had increased self-renewal, but no leukemia was observed. Here, all lethally irradiated mice transplanted with Dnmt3a-deleted HSCs died within 1 year. Animals were diagnosed with a spectrum of malignancies similar to those seen in patients with DNMT3A mutations, including myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, primary myelofibrosis, and T- and B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. In some cases, acquired malignancies exhibited secondary mutations similar to those identified in patients. Loss of Dnmt3a led to disturbed methylation patterns that were distinct in lymphoid and myeloid disease, suggesting lineage-specific methylation aberrations promoted by Dnmt3a loss. Global hypomethylation was observed in all of the malignancies, but lymphoid malignancies also exhibited hypermethylation, particularly at promoter regions. This mouse model underscores the important role of Dnmt3a in normal hematopoietic development and demonstrates that Dnmt3a loss of function confers a preleukemic phenotype on murine HSCs. This model may serve as a tool to study DNMT3A mutation associated malignancies and for developing targeted strategies for eliminating preleukemic cells for prevention and treatment of hematologic malignancies in the future.","['Mayle, Allison', 'Yang, Liubin', 'Rodriguez, Benjamin', 'Zhou, Ting', 'Chang, Edmund', 'Curry, Choladda V', 'Challen, Grant A', 'Li, Wei', 'Wheeler, David', 'Rebel, Vivienne I', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Mayle A', 'Yang L', 'Rodriguez B', 'Zhou T', 'Chang E', 'Curry CV', 'Challen GA', 'Li W', 'Wheeler D', 'Rebel VI', 'Goodell MA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/23 06:00'],"['2014/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39503-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-08-594648 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 22;125(4):629-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-08-594648.,,,"['K99 DK084259/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK092883/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK092883/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA183252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL092332/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HG007538/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK084259/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HG007538/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK060445/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG007538/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 DK084259/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK092883/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4304108,,,['Blood. 2015 Jan 22;125(4):585-6.

Ectopic introduction of c-Kit variants into a Dnmt3a-deficient background produced acute leukemia with a short latency (median survival, 67 days).

In this study, we used bioinformatics, cellular, and molecular methods to predict and prove that miR-363 directly targeted Mcl-1 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated regions) and caused downregulation of Mcl-1 in breast cancer. Resistance to chemotherapy is a major barrier for the effective treatment for advanced breast cancer, but our study indicated that miR-363 reversed the resistance of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (CDDP). In addition, transfection of breast cancer cells with Mcl-1 expression plasmid abolished the sensitization effect of miR-363 to cisplatin-inducing cytotoxicity. In summary, our study showed that miR-363 was a negative regulator of Mcl-1 expression, and the combination of miR-363 and cisplatin may be a novel approach in the treatment for breast cancer.","['Zhang, Ruiguang', 'Li, Yan', 'Dong, Xiaochuan', 'Peng, Li', 'Nie, Xiu']","['Zhang R', 'Li Y', 'Dong X', 'Peng L', 'Nie X']","['Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141122,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN363 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2014/11/25 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/11/23 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0347-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Dec;31(12):347. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0347-3.

Application of HLA-A2-restricted survivin-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) isolated from allogeneic HLA-mismatched TCR repertoires has, however, been impeded by the inability of these TCRs to distinguish healthy cells expressing low levels of survivin from cancer cells with high survivin expression levels. Here, we identified an HLA-A2-restricted survivin-specific TCR isolated from autologous TCR repertoires that targets tumor cells in vitro and in vivo but does not cause fratricidal toxicity. Molecular modeling of the TCR-peptide-HLA ternary complexes and alanine scanning revealed that the autologously derived TCRs had tighter interactions with the survivin peptide than did fratricidal TCRs. Similar recognition patterns were observed among 7 additional TAA-specific TCRs isolated from allogeneic versus autologous repertoires. Together, the results from this study indicate that maximal peptide recognition is key for TCR selectivity and likely critical for reducing unwanted off-target toxicities. Moreover, isolating TCRs from autologous repertoires to maximize TCR selectivity has potential as a useful strategy to identify and select other shared tumor- and self-antigen-specific TCRs and ensure selective antitumor activity.","['Arber, Caroline', 'Feng, Xiang', 'Abhyankar, Harshal', 'Romero, Errika', 'Wu, Meng-Fen', 'Heslop, Helen E', 'Barth, Patrick', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Savoldo, Barbara']","['Arber C', 'Feng X', 'Abhyankar H', 'Romero E', 'Wu MF', 'Heslop HE', 'Barth P', 'Dotti G', 'Savoldo B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141121,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cross Reactions', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*immunology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/transplantation']",2014/11/22 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2014/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['75876 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI75876 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2015 Jan;125(1):157-68. doi: 10.1172/JCI75876.

However, few studies have compared the incidence of NI according to the HM lineage. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of NI according to the type of HM lineage, and identify the risk factors for NI. METHODS: This prospective observational study monitored adult patients with HM admitted for >48 hours to the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army during 2010-2013. Attack rates and incidences of NI were compared, and multivariable logistic regression was used to control for confounding effects. RESULTS: This study included 6,613 admissions from 1,922 patients. During these admissions, 1,023 acquired 1,136 NI episodes, with an attack rate of 15.47% and incidence of 9.6 per thousand (95% CI: 9.1-10.2). Higher rates and densities of NIs were observed among myeloid neoplasm (MN) admissions, compared to lymphoid neoplasm (LN) admissions (28.42% vs. 11.00%, P<0.001 and 11.4% vs. 8.4 per thousand, P<0.001). NI attack rates in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) were higher than those in MDS (30.69% vs. 20.19%, P<0.001; 38.89% vs. 20.19%, P = 0.003). Attack rates in T/NK-cell neoplasm and B-cell neoplasm were higher than those in Hodgkin lymphoma (15.04% vs. 3.65%; 10.94% vs. 3.65%, P<0.001). Multivariable regression analysis indicated prolonged hospitalization, presence of central venous catheterization, neutropenia, current stem cell transplant, infection on admission, and old age were independently associated with higher NI incidence. After adjusting for these factors, MN admissions still had a higher risk of infection (odds ratio 1.34, 95% CI: 1.13-1.59, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Different NI attack rates were observed for HM from different lineages, with MN lineages having a higher attack rate and incidence than LN lineages. Special attention should be paid to MN admissions, especially AML and MDS/MPN admissions, to control NI incidence.","['Liu, Hui', 'Zhao, Jin', 'Xing, Yubin', 'Li, Meng', 'Du, Mingmei', 'Suo, Jijiang', 'Liu, Yunxi']","['Liu H', 'Zhao J', 'Xing Y', 'Li M', 'Du M', 'Suo J', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Digestive Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China; Department of Infection Management and Disease Control, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Digestive Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Digestive Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Infection Management and Disease Control, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Infection Management and Disease Control, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141121,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/*microbiology', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*complications/microbiology', 'Prospective Studies']",2014/11/22 06:00,2015/12/31 06:00,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0113506 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-30786 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 21;9(11):e113506. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0113506. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4240653,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed an imaging-based RNAi platform to identify protective cues from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) that promote survival of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Using a candidate gene approach, we detected distinct responses of individual ALL cases to RNA interference with stromal targets. The strongest effects were observed when interfering with solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) expression, which forms the cystine transporter xc- when associated with SLC7A11. Import of cystine and metabolism to cysteine by stromal cells provides the limiting substrate to generate and maintain glutathione in ALL. This metabolic interaction reduces oxidative stress in ALL cells that depend on stromal xc-. Indeed, cysteine depletion using cysteine dioxygenase resulted in leukemia cell death. Thus, functional evaluation of intercellular interactions between leukemia cells and their microenvironment identifies a selective dependency of ALL cells on stromal metabolism for a relevant subgroup of cases, providing new opportunities to develop more personalized approaches to leukemia treatment.","['Boutter, Jeannette', 'Huang, Yun', 'Marovca, Blerim', 'Vonderheit, Andreas', 'Grotzer, Michael A', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Wollscheid, Bernd', 'Horvath, Peter', 'Bornhauser, Beat C', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre']","['Boutter J', 'Huang Y', 'Marovca B', 'Vonderheit A', 'Grotzer MA', 'Eckert C', 'Cario G', 'Wollscheid B', 'Horvath P', 'Bornhauser BC', 'Bourquin JP']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

The current study aimed to assess the efficacy of TKIs and prognostic factors in the treatment of adults with Ph+-ALL. METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, the relationship between Ph+-ALL and treatment outcomes among Chinese patients receiving TKI-containing induction/consolidation chemotherapy was examined. A total of 86 Ph+-ALL patients were included and followed for 3.85 (0.43-9.30) years. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 86 Ph+-ALL patients (40 females and 46 males; median age: 34.0 years) were enrolled, including those with BCR/ABL transcripts 190 (n = 52), 210 (n = 25), and 230 (n = 2); BCR/ABL isoform determination was not available for 7 patients. Mortality was influenced by variable BCR/ABL transcripts and TKI administration, and BCR/ABL transcripts, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and TKI administration were associated with the occurrence of events. The OS rate in the TKI administration group during steady state was significantly higher compared with those patients who did not receive TKI administration (P = 0.008), the EFS rate in the TKI administration group during steady state was significantly higher compared with those patients who did not receive TKIs (P = 0.012), and also higher than those with TKI salvage administration (P = 0.004). BCR/ABL transcripts 210 showed preferable OS and EFS compared with BCR/ABL transcripts 190 and 230 (P<0.05 for each). CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility of Ph+-ALL to TKI associated with the patterns of BCR-ABL rearrangement is demonstrated for the first time, thus adding another risk-stratifying molecular prognostic tool for the management of patients with Ph+-ALL.","['Jing, Yu', 'Chen, Huiren', 'Liu, Mingjuan', 'Zhou, Minhang', 'Guo, Yuelu', 'Gao, Chunji', 'Wang, Quanshun', 'Li, Honghua', 'Zhao, Yu', 'Bo, Jian', 'Huang, Wenrong', 'Zhu, Haiyan', 'Zhang, Yongqing', 'Yu, Li']","['Jing Y', 'Chen H', 'Liu M', 'Zhou M', 'Guo Y', 'Gao C', 'Wang Q', 'Li H', 'Zhao Y', 'Bo J', 'Huang W', 'Zhu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Region, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China; Department of Hematology, the 309th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, the 309th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141121,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/22 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0110431 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-02082 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 21;9(11):e110431. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0110431. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4240579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding this threatening situation in adults with leukemia undergoing HSCT will assist health care professionals in providing holistic care to the patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was exploring the perceived threat in adults with leukemia undergoing HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This article is part of a longitudinal qualitative study which used the grounded theory approach and was conducted in 2009-2011. Ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for HSCT were recruited from the Hematology-Oncology Research Center and Stem Cell Transplantation, Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran. A series of pre-transplant and post-transplant in-depth interviews were held in the hospital's HSCT wards. Totally, 18 interviews were conducted. Three written narratives were also obtained from the participants. The Corbin and Strauss approach was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Perceived threat was one of the main categories that emerged from the data. This category included four subcategories, ""inattention to the signs and symptoms"", ""doubt and anxiety"", ""perception of danger and time limitation"" and ""change of life conditions"", which occurred in linear progression over time. CONCLUSION: Suffering from leukemia and experiencing HSCT are events that are uniquely perceived by patients. This threatening situation can significantly effect perception of patients and cause temporary or permanent alterations in patients' lives. Health care professionals can help these patients by deeper understanding of their experiences and effective interventions.","['Farsi, Zahra', 'Dehghan Nayeri, Nahid', 'Negarandeh, Reza']","['Farsi Z', 'Dehghan Nayeri N', 'Negarandeh R']","['Department of Medical Surgical, Faculty of Nursing, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran.', 'Department of Management, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran.', 'Department of Management, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130627,Netherlands,Nurs Midwifery Stud,Nursing and midwifery studies,101606711,,,,2013/06/01 00:00,2013/06/01 00:01,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5812/nms.11243 [doi]'],ppublish,Nurs Midwifery Stud. 2013 Jun;2(2):226-33. doi: 10.5812/nms.11243.

However, refractory disease and the emergence of antigen-loss tumor escape variants after treatment demonstrate the need to target additional antigens. Here we aimed to target the B-cell receptor-associated protein CD79b by a T-cell receptor (TCR)-based approach. Because thymic selection depletes high-avidity T cells recognizing CD79b-derived peptides presented in self-HLA molecules, we aimed to isolate T cells recognizing these peptides presented in allogeneic HLA. Peptide-HLA tetramers composed of CD79b peptides bound to either HLA-A2 or HLA-B7 were used to isolate T-cell clones from HLA-A*0201 and B*0702-negative individuals. For 3 distinct T-cell clones, CD79b specificity was confirmed through CD79b gene transduction and CD79b-specific shRNA knockdown. The CD79b-specific T-cell clones were highly reactive against CD79b-expressing primary B-cell malignancies, whereas no recognition of nonhematopoietic cells was observed. Although lacking CD79b-cell surface expression, intermediate reactivity toward monocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and T-cells was observed. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed low CD79b gene expression in these cell types. Therefore, aberrant gene expression must be taken into consideration when selecting common, apparently lineage-specific self-antigens as targets for TCR-based immunotherapies.","['Jahn, Lorenz', 'Hombrink, Pleun', 'Hassan, Chopie', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'van der Steen, Dirk M', 'Hagedoorn, Renate S', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M']","['Jahn L', 'Hombrink P', 'Hassan C', 'Kester MG', 'van der Steen DM', 'Hagedoorn RS', 'Falkenburg JH', 'van Veelen PA', 'Heemskerk MH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B7 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD79 Antigens/chemistry/*genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'HLA-B7 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/11/22 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39478-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-07-587840 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 5;125(6):949-58. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-07-587840.

METHODS: Cell growth inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis were determined in SHI-1 cells treated with DAC and/or ATRA, and the combination index of the two compounds was calculated. Methylation of the p16 and RAR-beta genes in SHI-1 cells was detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect mRNA expression of the p16 and RAR-beta genes, and Western blot analysis was performed for protein expression. RESULTS: The drug combination had a synergistic effect on growth inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis of SHI-1 cells, and the effects of DAC and ATRA were dependent on time. DAC, either alone or in combination with ATRA, induced demethylation of the genes p16 and RAR-beta, whereas ATRA alone had no effect on methylation. The RAR-beta gene was reexpressed following DAC-ATRA combination treatment, and both agents had no effect on p16 expression. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that DAC used in combination with ATRA has significant clinical potential in the treatment of acute monocytic leukemia.","['Xiang, Lili', 'Wang, Rong', 'Wei, Jiang', 'Qiu, Guoqiang', 'Cen, Jiannong', 'Hu, Shaoyan', 'Xie, Xiaobao', 'Chen, Zixing', 'Gu, Weiying']","['Xiang L', 'Wang R', 'Wei J', 'Qiu G', 'Cen J', 'Hu S', 'Xie X', 'Chen Z', 'Gu W']","[""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Changzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141120,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/agonists/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/agonists/pharmacology']",2014/11/22 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['000367586 [pii]', '10.1159/000367586 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2015;133(3):279-86. doi: 10.1159/000367586.

However, only a few Pt(IV) compounds entered (pre)clinical trials, e.g. satraplatin, while most of the others were only tested in vitro. Aim of the study was investigation of the in vivo pharmacological behavior as well as the anticancer activity of two novel platinum(IV) complexes vs. satraplatin. The drugs were selected due to significantly different in vitro cytotoxicity while sharing some physicochemical properties (e.g. lipophilicity). Initial experiments indicated that the highly in vitro cytotoxic compound 1 ((OC-6-33)-dichloridobis((4-ethoxy)-4-oxobutanoato)-bis(ethylamine)platinum(IV)) was also characterized by high drug absorption and tissue platinum levels after oral application. Interestingly, analysis of serum samples using SEC-ICP-MS revealed that the administered drugs have completely been metabolized and/or bound to proteins in serum within 2 h after treatment. With regard to the activity in vivo, the outcomes were rather unexpected: although potent anticancer effect of 1 was observed in cell culture, the effects in vivo were rather minor. Nevertheless, 1 was superior to 2 ((OC-6-33)-diammine(cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylato)-bis((4-cyclopentylamino)-4-oxo butanoato)platinum(IV)) after i.p. administration, which was, at least to some extent, in accordance to the cell culture experiments.

Sepsis remains a common cause of mortality in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with intensive induction chemotherapy. The expression of TLRs and their association with the development of sepsis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 and occurrence of sepsis in patients treated with intensive induction chemotherapy for AML. A total of 103 patients with newly diagnosed AML were evaluated. Bone marrow samples were taken before induction therapy. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, the mRNA expression of genes TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 was measured. Neutropenic fever occurred in 98 patients. We identified 20 episodes of severe sepsis (20%). In patients with neutropenic fever, the mRNA expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was significant higher in septic patients than in patients without sepsis symptoms (DeltaCt TLR2 0.93 +/- 0.82 vs 0.78 +/- 0.85 and DeltaCt TLR4 0.38 +/- 0.29 vs 0.34 +/- 0.25). Moreover, we observed that expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was significantly higher in patients with AML and bacterial infection in comparison with group with separate fungal infection (DeltaCt TLR2 1.15 +/- 1.06 vs 0.66 +/- 0.51 and DeltaCt TLR4 0.45 +/- 0.38 vs 0.21 +/- 0.19). Our results suggest that TLRs could be an independent factor for the development of sepsis in patients with acute myeloid leukemias after intensive induction chemotherapy.

Of these cases, 79% showed at least one nonsynonymous mutation, and cases of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities showed a lower frequency of mutations versus AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (P<0.001). Mutational analysis further demonstrated that TP53 mutations are associated with complex karyotype AML, whereas ASXL1 and U2AF1 mutations are associated with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Furthermore, U2AF1 mutations were specifically associated with trilineage morphologic dysplasia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that U2AF1 and TP53 mutations are associated with absence of clinical remission, poor overall survival (OS), and poor disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.0001), whereas TET2 and ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor OS (P<0.03).

Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are more frequent in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome than in de novo disease, but the role of p53 immunohistochemistry in the therapy-related setting has not been specifically investigated. We studied p53 protein immunoreactivity in bone marrow biopsies of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and correlated protein expression with TP53 mutation status, clinicopathologic features and outcome. We first studied 32 patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and 63 patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from one institution and then validated our results in a separate group of 32 patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and 56 patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome from a different institution. Strong p53 immunostaining in >/=1% of bone marrow cells was highly predictive of a TP53 gene mutation (P<0.0001) and was strongly associated with a high-risk karyotype (P<0.0001). The presence of >/=1% p53 strongly positive cells was associated with poorer overall and disease-specific survival, particularly in the subset of patients treated with stem-cell transplantation. In a multivariable Cox regression model, the presence of >/=1% p53 strongly expressing cells was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival in both cohorts, with hazard ratios of 3.434 (CI: 1.751-6.735, P<0.0001) and 3.156 (CI: 1.502-6.628, P=0.002). Our data indicate that p53 protein expression, evaluated in bone marrow biopsies by a widely available immunohistochemical method, prognostically stratifies patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms independent of other risk factors. p53 immunostaining thus represents an easily applicable method to assess risk in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients.","['Cleven, Arjen H G', 'Nardi, Valentina', 'Ok, Chi Young', 'Goswami, Maitrayee', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Zheng, Zongli', 'Iafrate, A John', 'Abdul Hamid, Myrurgia A', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Hasserjian, Robert P']","['Cleven AH', 'Nardi V', 'Ok CY', 'Goswami M', 'Dal Cin P', 'Zheng Z', 'Iafrate AJ', 'Abdul Hamid MA', 'Wang SA', 'Hasserjian RP']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Center of Advanced Molecular Diagnostics, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141121,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/22 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2014153 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2014.153 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2015 Apr;28(4):552-63. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2014.153.

Like angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis occurs in pathophysiological conditions but not in healthy adults. AML is closely associated with the vasculature system, and the interplay between lymphangiogenic cytokines maintains leukemic blast survival in the bone marrow (BM). Once AML is induced, proangiogenic cytokines function as angiogenic or lymphangiogenic factors and affect hematopoietic cells, including BM-derived immune cells. Simultaneously, the representative cytokines, VEGFs and their receptors are expressed on AML blasts in vascular and osteoblast niches in both the BM and the peripheral circulation. After exposure to (lymph)angiogenic cytokines in leukemogenesis and infiltration, immune cell phenotypes and functions are affected. These dynamic behaviors in the BM reflect the clinical features of AML. In this review, we note the importance of lymphangiogenic factors and their receptors in hematopoietic cells in AML. Understanding the functional characterization of (lymph)angiogenic factors in the BM niche in AML will also be helpful in interrupting the engraftment of leukemic stem cells and for enhancing immune cell function by modulating the tumor microenvironment.","['Lee, Ji Yoon', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Lee JY', 'Kim HJ']","['Cancer Research Institute, Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141121,United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*physiopathology', '*Lymphangiogenesis', 'Lymphatic Vessels/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/immunology']",2014/11/22 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['emm201472 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2014.72 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Mol Med. 2014 Nov 21;46:e122. doi: 10.1038/emm.2014.72.,,,,PMC4262793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The four molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma that have been identified - WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4 - have molecular and topographical characteristics suggestive of different cells of origin. Definitive identification of the cell(s) of origin of the medulloblastoma subgroups, particularly the poorer prognosis Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma, is critical to understand the pathogenesis of the disease, and ultimately for the development of more effective treatment options. To address this issue, the gene expression profiles of normal human neural tissues and cell types representing a broad neuro-developmental continuum, were compared to those of two independent cohorts of primary human medulloblastoma specimens. Clustering, co-expression network, and gene expression analyses revealed that WNT and SHH medulloblastoma may be derived from distinct neural stem cell populations during early embryonic development, while the transcriptional profiles of Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma resemble cerebellar granule neuron precursors at weeks 10-15 and 20-30 of embryogenesis, respectively. Our data indicate that Group 3 medulloblastoma may arise through abnormal neuronal differentiation, whereas deregulation of synaptic pruning-associated apoptosis may be driving Group 4 tumorigenesis. Overall, these data provide significant new insight into the spatio-temporal relationships and molecular pathogenesis of the human medulloblastoma subgroups, and provide an important framework for the development of more refined model systems, and ultimately improved therapeutic strategies.","['Hooper, Cornelia M', 'Hawes, Susan M', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Gottardo, Nicholas G', 'Dallas, Peter B']","['Hooper CM', 'Hawes SM', 'Kees UR', 'Gottardo NG', 'Dallas PB']","['Brain Tumour Research Program, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia; Centre of Excellence in Computational Systems Biology, ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Monash Institute of Medical Research, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia."", 'Brain Tumour Research Program, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia; Department of Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Brain Tumour Research Program, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141120,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', '*Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/12/25 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0112909 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-25074 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 20;9(11):e112909. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0112909. eCollection 2014.,,,['Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC4239019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has also been further developed to treat solid tumors in clinical trials. However, the therapeutic effects on malignant tumors appeared to be unsatisfactory, as these cells exhibited resistance towards arsenic. In this study, we explored new therapeutic strategies for treatment of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells based on arsenic metabolites. The MCF-7 cells were exposed to three arsenic species, namely, inorganic arsenite (iAs(III)) and its intermediate metabolites monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)) and dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)) either alone or in combination with cryptotanshinone (CPT) to establish their anticancer effects against MCF-7 cells. Surprisingly, MCF-7 cells were shown to be resistant to both iAs(III) and CPT when used alone; however, they were shown to be relatively sensitive to treatment when exposed to MMA(III) and DMA(III) alone. Conversely, the combination of MMA(III) with CPT showed significantly enhanced anticancer effects on MCF-7 cells at low doses, but no appreciable effect was observed upon exposure to the other two arsenic species with CPT. In addition, remarkable redistribution of pro-apoptosis related proteins Bax and Bak was observed in the mitochondria, together with activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-9 after exposure to the combination of MMA(III) with CPT. Furthermore, we clearly found that induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was predominantly triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after exposure to the combination of MMA(III) with CPT.","['Zhang, Yan Fang', 'Zhang, Min', 'Huang, Xu Lei', 'Fu, Yu Jie', 'Jiang, Yu Han', 'Bao, Ling Ling', 'Maimaitiyiming, Yasen', 'Zhang, Guang Ji', 'Wang, Qian Qian', 'Naranmandura, Hua']","['Zhang YF', 'Zhang M', 'Huang XL', 'Fu YJ', 'Jiang YH', 'Bao LL', 'Maimaitiyiming Y', 'Zhang GJ', 'Wang QQ', 'Naranmandura H']","['Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141120,England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5E9SXT166N (cryptotanshinone)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Arsenic/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Phenanthrenes/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2014/11/21 06:00,2016/02/11 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4mt00263f [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2015 Jan;7(1):165-73. doi: 10.1039/c4mt00263f.

Its antitumour activities have been extensively studied in a variety of model systems and clinical trials; however, to date the only malignancy responsive to ATRA treatment is acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) where it induces complete remission in the majority of cases when administered in combination with light chemotherapy and/or arsenic trioxide. After decades of studies, the efficacy of ATRA to treat other acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subtypes and solid tumours remains poor. Recent studies directed to improve ATRA responsiveness in non-APL AML seem to indicate that the lack of effective ATRA response in these tumours may be primarily due to aberrant epigenetics, which negatively affect ATRA-regulated gene expression and its antileukaemic activity. Epigenetic reprogramming could potentially restore therapeutic effects of ATRA in all AML subtypes. This review discusses the current progresses in the understanding how ATRA can be utilised in the therapy of non-APL AML and other cancers.","['Schenk, T', 'Stengel, S', 'Zelent, A']","['Schenk T', 'Stengel S', 'Zelent A']","['Haemato-Oncology Research Unit, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, 123 Old Brompton Road, SW7 3RP London, UK.', 'Haemato-Oncology Research Unit, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, 123 Old Brompton Road, SW7 3RP London, UK.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1550 NW 10th Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141120,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/01/27 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2014412 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2014.412 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2014 Nov 25;111(11):2039-45. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.412.

As proof of concept, we demonstrate that variations in viscoelasticity affect the flow trajectory of one type of leukemia cell line (K562) in relation to another leukemia cell line (HL60) as well as healthy leukocytes. These differences in cell trajectory can be utilized to enrich and sort K562 cells from HL60 cells and leukocytes. The microfluidic device utilizes periodic, diagonal ridges to compress and translate the cells laterally perpendicular to channel axis. The ridge spacing is tuned to allow relaxation of the K562 cells but not the HL60 cells or leukocytes. Therefore, the periodic compression laterally translates weakly viscous cells, while highly viscous cells respond to hydrodynamic circulation forces generated by the slanted ridges. As a result, cell sorting has strong dependency on cell viscosity. We use atomic force microscopy and high-speed optical microscopy to measure cell stiffness, cell relaxation rate constant, and cell size for all cell types.

Prostaglandin E2 is synthesized from arachidonic acid by the enzymes cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin E synthase. In some pathological conditions, the isozymes cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 are transiently induced, leading to prostaglandin E2 overproduction. The present study showed that Dioscorea japonica extract suppresses mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 in human non-small-cell lung carcinoma A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The suppressive effects of Dioscorea japonica extract on the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 were confirmed by Western blotting, cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin E2 production. Dioscorea japonica extract induced the translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB from the nucleus to the cytosol and inhibited the activity of the cyclooxygenase-2 promoter. Furthermore Dioscorea japonica extract suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic factor B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 and enhanced apoptotic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive intensity in A549 cells. These results suggest that Dioscorea japonica extract suppresses the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1, with the regulation of the transcriptional activity of cyclooxygenase-2, and induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Thus, Dioscorea japonica may contribute to the prevention of prostaglandin E2-mediated pathophysiological responses such as carcinogenesis and inflammation.","['Suzuki-Yamamoto, Toshiko', 'Tanaka, Sayuri', 'Tsukayama, Izumi', 'Takafuji, Miki', 'Hanada, Takae', 'Arakawa, Toshiya', 'Kawakami, Yuki', 'Kimoto, Masumi', 'Takahashi, Yoshitaka']","['Suzuki-Yamamoto T', 'Tanaka S', 'Tsukayama I', 'Takafuji M', 'Hanada T', 'Arakawa T', 'Kawakami Y', 'Kimoto M', 'Takahashi Y']","['Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, 1757 Kanazawa, Tobetsu-cho, Ishikari-gun, Hokkaido 061-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 719-1197, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140909,Japan,J Clin Biochem Nutr,Journal of clinical biochemistry and nutrition,8700907,,,,2014/11/21 06:00,2014/11/21 06:01,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3164/jcbn.14-25 [doi]', 'jcbn14-25 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Biochem Nutr. 2014 Nov;55(3):162-7. doi: 10.3164/jcbn.14-25.

In vitro, CD-160130 induced leukemia cell apoptosis, and could overcome bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-induced chemoresistance. This effect was caused by interference with the survival signaling pathways triggered by MSCs. In vivo, CD-160130 produced an antileukemic activity, stronger than that caused by cytarabine. Consistent with its atypical target specificity, CD-160130 did not bind to the main binding site of the arrhythmogenic KV11.1 blockers (the Phe656 pore residue). Importantly, in guinea pigs CD-160130 produced neither alteration of the cardiac action potential shape in dissociated cardiomyocytes nor any lengthening of the QT interval in vivo. Moreover, CD-160130 had no myelotoxicity on human bone marrow-derived cells. Therefore, CD-160130 is a promising first-in-class compound to attempt oncologic therapy without cardiotoxicity, based on targeting KV11.1. Because leukemia and cardiac cells tend to express different ratios of the A and B KV11.1 isoforms, the pharmacological properties of CD-160130 may depend, at least in part, on isoform specificity.","['Gasparoli, Luca', ""D'Amico, Massimo"", 'Masselli, Marika', 'Pillozzi, Serena', 'Caves, Rachel', 'Khuwaileh, Rawan', 'Tiedke, Wolfgang', 'Mugridge, Kenneth', 'Pratesi, Alessandro', 'Mitcheson, John S', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Becchetti, Andrea', 'Arcangeli, Annarosa']","['Gasparoli L', ""D'Amico M"", 'Masselli M', 'Pillozzi S', 'Caves R', 'Khuwaileh R', 'Tiedke W', 'Mugridge K', 'Pratesi A', 'Mitcheson JS', 'Basso G', 'Becchetti A', 'Arcangeli A']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy (L.G., S.P., A.A.); Department of Chemistry ""Ugo Schiff,"" University of Florence, Florence, Italy (M.M., A.P.); DI.V.A.L.

Test genes are scored based on their average similarity to the training set, and the rankings of genes under various similarity criteria are aggregated via statistical methods. The contributions of our work are threefold: (i) first, based on the realization that there is no unique way to define an optimal aggregate for rankings, we investigate the predictive quality of a number of new aggregation methods and known fusion techniques from machine learning and social choice theory. Within this context, we quantify the influence of the number of training genes and similarity criteria on the diagnostic quality of the aggregate and perform in-depth cross-validation studies; (ii) second, we propose a new approach to genomic data aggregation, termed HyDRA (Hybrid Distance-score Rank Aggregation), which combines the advantages of score-based and combinatorial aggregation techniques. We also propose incorporating a new top-versus-bottom (TvB) weighting feature into the hybrid schemes. The TvB feature ensures that aggregates are more reliable at the top of the list, rather than at the bottom, since only top candidates are tested experimentally; (iii) third, we propose an iterative procedure for gene discovery that operates via successful augmentation of the set of training genes by genes discovered in previous rounds, checked for consistency. MOTIVATION: Fundamental results from social choice theory, political and computer sciences, and statistics have shown that there exists no consistent, fair and unique way to aggregate rankings. Instead, one has to decide on an aggregation approach using predefined set of desirable properties for the aggregate. The aggregation methods fall into two categories, score- and distance-based approaches, each of which has its own drawbacks and advantages. This work is motivated by the observation that merging these two techniques in a computationally efficient manner, and by incorporating additional constraints, one can ensure that the predictive quality of the resulting aggregation algorithm is very high. RESULTS: We tested HyDRA on a number of gene sets, including autism, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, ischaemic stroke, leukemia, lymphoma and osteoarthritis. Furthermore, we performed iterative gene discovery for glioblastoma, meningioma and breast cancer, using a sequentially augmented list of training genes related to the Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni condition and other diseases. The methods outperform state-of-the-art software tools such as ToppGene and Endeavour. Despite this finding, we recommend as best practice to take the union of top-ranked items produced by different methods for the final aggregated list.

In this tribute to Prof. Martin Lackmann and Prof. Tony Pawson, we utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas resources to shed new light on the understanding of this family. We found that mutation and expression analysis define two clusters of co-expressed Eph family genes that relate to aggressive phenotypes across multiple cancer types. Analysis of signal transduction pathways using reverse-phase protein arrays revealed a network of interactions, which associates cluster-specific Eph genes with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metabolism, DNA-damage repair and apoptosis. Our findings support the role of the Eph family in modulating cancer progression and reveal distinct patterns of Eph expression, which correlate with disease outcome. These observations provide further rationale for seeking cancer therapies, which target the Eph/ephrin system.","['Al-Ejeh, Fares', 'Offenhauser, Carolin', 'Lim, Yi Chieh', 'Stringer, Brett W', 'Day, Bryan W', 'Boyd, Andrew W']","['Al-Ejeh F', 'Offenhauser C', 'Lim YC', 'Stringer BW', 'Day BW', 'Boyd AW']","['Brain Cancer Research Unit & Leukaemia Foundation Research Unit, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute , Brisbane, Queensland , Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141120,England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Eph Family)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Eph Family/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/08/22 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08977194.2014.984807 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 2014 Dec;32(6):254-64. doi: 10.3109/08977194.2014.984807.

To the authors' knowledge, the prognosis of patients with low-risk and intermediate-1-risk MDS by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) after HMA failure has not been explored comprehensively. METHODS: The clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of 438 patients with low-risk and intermediate-1-risk MDS who were treated with HMAs were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Using the International Working Group response criteria, the overall objective response to HMA was 35% with a median of 6 cycles of HMA administered, and the median response duration was 7 months. Only 7% of patients had disease that transformed into acute myeloid leukemia while receiving therapy. Of the 290 patients who were evaluable at the time of HMA failure, 77% remained in the lower-risk disease categories. On multivariate analysis, baseline neutropenia, intermediate-risk and poor-risk baseline karyotype, and lack of response to HMA were found to be independently associated with a higher risk of disease progression. With a median follow-up of 16 months, the median transformation-free survival and overall survival (OS) after HMA failure were 15 months and 17 months, respectively. On multivariate analysis, only The University of Texas MD Anderson Global Scoring System was found to be independently predictive of outcome, with patients with higher-risk categories having poor transformation-free survival (hazards ratio [HR], 1.5; P = .003) and OS (HR, 1.8; P = .002). The administration of salvage therapy was independently associated with better OS only (HR, 0.8; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of patients with lower-risk MDS after HMA failure are poor and the treatment of these patients remains an unmet medical need. OS is a reasonable primary endpoint for clinical studies targeting this population.","['Jabbour, Elias J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Strati, Paolo', 'Mishra, Asmita', 'Al Ali, Najla H', 'Padron, Eric', 'Lancet, Jeffrey', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Daver, Naval', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Steensma, David P', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Dezern, Amy', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'List, Alan F', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Komrokji, Rami S']","['Jabbour EJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Strati P', 'Mishra A', 'Al Ali NH', 'Padron E', 'Lancet J', 'Kadia T', 'Daver N', ""O'Brien S"", 'Steensma DP', 'Sekeres MA', 'Gore SD', 'Dezern A', 'Roboz GJ', 'List AF', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Komrokji RS']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141119,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29145 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Mar 15;121(6):876-82. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29145.

Microsatellite-based typing methods using sets of genetic markers have been developed and reported for population structure analysis of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis, but no studies have been published for genetic analysis of C. tropicalis. The objective of this study was to develop new microsatellite loci that have the ability to distinguish among C. tropicalis isolates. RESULTS: DNA sequences containing over 10 bi- or tri-nucleotide repeats were selected from the C. tropicalis genome database. Thirty PCR primers sets specific for the microsatellite loci were designed and tested using eight clinically independent isolates. According to the amplification efficiency, specificity, and observed polymorphisms, eight markers were selected for further population structure analysis and molecular typing. Sixty-five independent C. tropicalis isolates were genotyped using these 8 markers. Based on these analyses, six microsatellite loci were confirmed, although two loci were found to be with unstable flanking areas. The six polymorphic loci displayed 4-22 alleles and 7-27 genotypes. The discriminatory power of the six loci ranged from 0.70 to 0.95. Genotyping results obtained by microsatellite analysis were compared to PCR-fingerprinting and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). The comparisons showed that microsatellite analysis and MLST had the similar discriminatory power for C. tropicalis, which were more powerful than PCR-fingerprinting. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first attempt to develop new microsatellite loci for C. tropicalis. These newly developed markers will be a valuable resource for the differentiation of C. tropicalis isolates. More C. tropicalis isolates will need to be sequenced and analyzed in order to fully show the potential of these newly developed microsatellite markers.","['Wu, Yuan', 'Zhou, Hai-jian', 'Che, Jie', 'Li, Wen-ge', 'Bian, Fu-ning', 'Yu, Shuan-bao', 'Zhang, Li-juan', 'Lu, Jinxing']","['Wu Y', 'Zhou HJ', 'Che J', 'Li WG', 'Bian FN', 'Yu SB', 'Zhang LJ', 'Lu J']","['State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chang bai Road 155, Chang ping District, Beijing, China. wuyuan@icdc.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chang bai Road 155, Chang ping District, Beijing, China. zhouhaijian@icdc.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chang bai Road 155, Chang ping District, Beijing, China. chejie@icdc.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chang bai Road 155, Chang ping District, Beijing, China. liwenge@icdc.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chang bai Road 155, Chang ping District, Beijing, China. bianfuning@hotmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chang bai Road 155, Chang ping District, Beijing, China. yushuanbao@126.com.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. emily97@126.com.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chang bai Road 155, Chang ping District, Beijing, China. lujinxing@icdc.cn.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141120,England,BMC Microbiol,BMC microbiology,100966981,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Fungal)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Candida tropicalis/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/microbiology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Typing/*methods', 'Mycological Typing Techniques/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12866-014-0245-z [doi]', 's12866-014-0245-z [pii]']",epublish,BMC Microbiol. 2014 Nov 20;14:245. doi: 10.1186/s12866-014-0245-z.,,,,PMC4247128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their activation is generally short lived, the cellular outcome is a stimulus- and cell context-dependent differential activation of NR4A target genes that regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammation, atherogenesis, metabolism, DNA repair and tumorigenesis. NR4A1 and NR4A3 were identified to function as tumor suppressors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Deletion of both nuclear receptors led to rapid development of AML in mice. Loss of NR4A1 and NR4A3 was a common feature in human AML patients. Additionally, NR4A1 and NR4A3 hypoallelic mice - mice with a reduced NR4A1 and NR4A3 expression - develop a chronic myeloid malignancy that recapitulates the pathological features of myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative neoplasms with progression to AML in rare cases. Recently, a reduced NR4A1 and NR4A3 expression was described in aggressive lymphomas and low NR4A1 expression was associated with poor overall survival. Overexpression of NR4A1 in aggressive lymphoma cells led to induction of apoptosis and abrogated tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Recently, it was shown that NR4A inducing agents or NR4A agonist possess/induce apoptotic effects in AML and lymphoma cells. Due to this fact and the growing number of NR4A1 and NR4A3 inducing agents and NR4A agonists, both receptors represent new targets for anti tumor therapy.","['Wenzl, Kerstin', 'Troppan, Katharina', 'Neumeister, Peter', 'Deutsch, Alexander J A']","['Wenzl K', 'Troppan K', 'Neumeister P', 'Deutsch AJ']","['Auenbruggerplatz 38, A-8036 Graz, Austria. alexander.deutsch@medunigraz.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (NR4A3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/07/16 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CDT-EPUB-63482 [pii]', '10.2174/1389450115666141120112818 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2015;16(1):38-46. doi: 10.2174/1389450115666141120112818.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that As2O3 selectively eliminates pathogenic B220-expressing T cells in autoimmune MRL/lpr mice. We investigated herein the relationship between As2O3 sensitivity of leukemic T-cell lines and the expression levels of the B220 isoform of transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45. METHODS: GSH content, O2(-) production, and B220, HSP70, Fas and FasL membrane expression was measured by flow cytometry. Subcellular localization of B220 was determined by imaging flow cytometry. Cell death was analyzed by morphological changes, annexin V and propidium iodide staining, and caspase 8 and 9 activation. B220 mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. Activated NF-kappaB p50 was quantified by a DNA binding ELISA. RESULTS: We selected human (Jurkat, Jurkat variant J45.01, HPB-ALL) and mouse (EL-4, BW5147, L1210) T-cell lines for their marked differences in As2O3 sensitivity over a large range of doses (1 to 20 muM). Differences in redox status cannot explain the dramatic differences in As2O3 sensitivity observed among the T-cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found that B220 is differentially induced on As2O3-treated T-cell lines. As2O3 treatment for 24 h induced low (HPB-ALL), intermediate (Jurkat) and high (EL-4, BW5147) levels of B220 membrane expression, membrane-bound HSP70 and cell death, but inhibited NF-kappaB p50 nuclear translocation. When high levels of B220 expression were achieved with low doses of As2O3, the T-cell lines died by apoptosis only. When high doses of As2O3 were required to induce B220 expression, leukemic T cells died by both apoptosis and necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular redox status is not essential for As2O3 sensitivity of leukemic T cells, suggesting the existence of additional factors determining their sensitivity to As2O3 cytotoxicity. Phosphatase B220 could be such a factor of sensitivity. As2O3 treatment inhibits NF-kappaB p50 nuclear translocation, and induces B220 expression and cell death in a dose and time dependent manner. The levels of B220 induction on leukemic T cells strictly correlate with both the extent and form of cell death, B220 might therefore play a checkpoint role in death pathways.","['Benbijja, Mohcine', 'Mellouk, Amine', 'Bobe, Pierre']","['Benbijja M', 'Mellouk A', 'Bobe P']","['Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France. pierre.bobe@u-psud.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141119,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred MRL lpr', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-251 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-251 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 Nov 19;13:251. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-251.,,,,PMC4252024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a novel doxorubicin-transferrin (DOX-TRF) conjugate aimed to direct anticancer drugs against therapeutic targets that display altered levels of expression in malignant versus normal cells. Our previous work has shown that the cellular bio-distribution of the conjugate is dependent on a dynamic balance between influx and efflux processes. Here, we set out to investigate whether P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression may affect DOX-TRF conjugate-induced cellular drug accumulation and cytotoxicity. RESULTS: All experiments were carried out on human erythromyeloblastoid cells exhibiting P-gp over-expression (K562/DOX) and its drug sensitive parental line (K562). MTT cytotoxicity, flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy and RT-PCR assessments revealed that the investigated conjugate (DOX-TRF) possesses a greater cytotoxic potential than free DOX. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the newly developed DOX-TRF conjugate is a less P-gp dependent substrate than free DOX and, consequently, may be used in a clinical setting to increase treatment efficacy in resistant human tumors.","['Szwed, Marzena', 'Kania, Katarzyna D', 'Jozwiak, Zofia']","['Szwed M', 'Kania KD', 'Jozwiak Z']","['Department of Thermobiology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236, Lodz, Poland, szwedma@biol.uni.lodz.pl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141120,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Transferrin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/*pharmacology']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/09/16 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13402-014-0205-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2014 Dec;37(6):421-8. doi: 10.1007/s13402-014-0205-5.

Recent changes in transplantation practices, including the use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and/or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen may have favorably impacted the epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFI) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Yet, the impact of removing fluconazole prophylaxis after RIC PBSC allotransplant is ill known. Here, a retrospective analysis was performed comparing patients who received fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis (n = 53) or not (n = 56) after allo-SCT for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome. Sixteen IFI were documented (14 %) at a median time of 103 days after transplantation, including eight before day +100, at a similar rate, whether the patients received fluconazole prophylaxis (13 %) or not (16 %). IFI were due mainly to Aspergillus species (87 %), and only two Candida-related IFI (13 %) were documented in the non-fluconazole group before day +100. The incidences of IFI (overall, before or after day +100) as well as 3-year overall and disease-free survival, non-relapse mortality, or acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were similar between both groups. In conclusion, this study suggests that fluconazole may not be required at the initial phase of RIC allo-SCT using PBSC. This result has to be confirmed prospectively while Aspergillus prophylaxis should be discussed in this particular setting.","['Brissot, Eolia', 'Cahu, Xavier', 'Guillaume, Thierry', 'Delaunay, Jacques', 'Ayari, Sameh', 'Peterlin, Pierre', 'Le Bourgeois, Amandine', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Chevallier, Patrice']","['Brissot E', 'Cahu X', 'Guillaume T', 'Delaunay J', 'Ayari S', 'Peterlin P', 'Le Bourgeois A', 'Harousseau JL', 'Milpied N', 'Bene MC', 'Moreau P', 'Mohty M', 'Chevallier P']","[""Hematology Department and Centre d'Investigation Clinique en Cancerologie (CI2C), CHU Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141121,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chemoprevention/*methods', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/05/02 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2259-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94(4):663-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2259-x.

OBJECTIVE: We used autologous immature DCs as feeder cells for the in-vitro expansion of NK cells and studied the function of the NK cell cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NK cells were cultured for 15 days in the presence of autologous, immature DCs. Fold expansion, killing activity and expression of IFN-gamma, perforin and granzyme B were evaluated. RESULTS: The highest NK cell expansion efficiency was observed when the ratio of NK cells:DCs was 2:1 and when cells were cultured in a contact-dependent manner. The killing activity of NK cells was highest when the NK:DC ratio was 10:1. NK cell cultures exhibited a significant upregulation in the mRNA expression of IFN-gamma, perforin and granzyme B when the ratio of NK cells to DCs was 10:1. DISCUSSION: We successfully amplified NK cells using autologous immature DCs derived from human peripheral monocytes after induction as feeder cells. The use of autologous immature DCs for ex-vivo expansion of NK cells can be clinically applied to overcome limitations, such as the small number of NK cells in peripheral blood, and the high cost of NK cell sorting. Transfusion of allogeneic reactive NK cells has been suggested as a potential adjunctive therapeutic strategy after transplantation. CONCLUSION: Autologous immature DCs can be used as feeder cells for ex-vivo expansion of functional NK cells.","['Li, Xiao-Hong', 'Wu, Xiao-Xiong', 'Wu, Ya-Mei', 'Da, Wan-Ming', 'Li, Meng', 'Cai, Bo', 'Zhao, Xiao-Li', 'Dou, Li-Ping', 'Gao, Chun-Ji']","['Li XH', 'Wu XX', 'Wu YM', 'Da WM', 'Li M', 'Cai B', 'Zhao XL', 'Dou LP', 'Gao CJ']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Chinese PLA General Hospital , Beijing , China and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141120,England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2014/11/21 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08923973.2014.980042 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2015 Feb;37(1):72-80. doi: 10.3109/08923973.2014.980042.

Achieving this goal in a statistically meaningful way requires (a) a measure of distinctness of a branch and (b) a test to determine the significance of the observed measure, applicable to all branches and across multiple scales of dissimilarity. RESULTS: We formulate a method termed Tree Branches Evaluated Statistically for Tightness (TBEST) for identifying significantly distinct tree branches in hierarchical clusters. For each branch of the tree a measure of distinctness, or tightness, is defined as a rational function of heights, both of the branch and of its parent. A statistical procedure is then developed to determine the significance of the observed values of tightness. We test TBEST as a tool for tree-based data partitioning by applying it to five benchmark datasets, one of them synthetic and the other four each from a different area of biology.

It is therefore not surprising that in some patients, the management of AML will be complicated by a coexistent pregnancy. However, the association of leukemia and pregnancy is uncommon. Its incidence is estimated to be 1 in 75,000-100,000 pregnancies. During pregnancy, most leukemias are acute: two-thirds are myeloid and one-third are lymphoblastic. There is no standard approach for this clinical dilemma, in part because of variables such as the type of AML, the seriousness of the symptoms, and the patient's personal beliefs. In many cases, the diagnostic workup has to be altered because of the pregnancy, and often available treatments have varying risks to the fetus. While chemotherapy is reported to have some risks during the first trimester, it is admitted that it can be administered safely during the second and the third trimesters.","['Thomas, Xavier']",['Thomas X'],"['Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre Benite, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150418,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*diagnosis/drug therapy']",2014/11/21 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12479 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Aug;95(2):124-36. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12479.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which is effective in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, can induce differentiation of other types of myeloid leukemia cells, and combined treatment with retinoid and 1,25(OH)2D3 effectively enhances the differentiation of leukemia cells into macrophage-like cells. Recent work has classified macrophages into M1 and M2 types. In this study, we investigated the effect of combined treatment with retinoid and 1,25(OH)2D3 on differentiation of myeloid leukemia THP-1 and HL60 cells. 9-cis Retinoic acid (9cRA) plus 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited proliferation of THP-1 and HL60 cells and increased myeloid differentiation markers including nitroblue tetrazolium reducing activity and expression of CD14 and CD11b. ATRA and the synthetic retinoic acid receptor agonist Am80 exhibited similar effects in combination with 1,25(OH)2D3 but less effectively than 9cRA, while the retinoid X receptor agonist HX630 was not effective. 9cRA plus 1,25(OH)2D3 effectively increased expression of M2 macrophage marker genes, such as CD163, ARG1 and IL10, increased surface CD163 expression, and induced interleukin-10 secretion in myeloid leukemia cells, while 9cRA alone had weaker effects on these phenotypes and 1,25(OH)2D3 was not effective. Taken together, our results demonstrate selective induction of M2 macrophage markers in human myeloid leukemia cells by combined treatment with 9cRA and 1,25(OH)2D3.","['Takahashi, Hiromichi', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Iriyama, Noriyoshi', 'Hasegawa, Yuichiro', 'Uchida, Hikaru', 'Nakagawa, Masaru', 'Makishima, Makoto', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Takei, Masami']","['Takahashi H', 'Hatta Y', 'Iriyama N', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Uchida H', 'Nakagawa M', 'Makishima M', 'Takeuchi J', 'Takei M']","['Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141119,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (dihydroxy-vitamin D3)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Arginase/genetics/metabolism', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*toxicity', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/12/23 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0113722 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-37744 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 19;9(11):e113722. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0113722. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4237509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported the overexpression of Mcl-1 protein in human oral cancers. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of the expression of three known Mcl-1 isoforms in oral tumors and the effect of targeting Mcl-1L isoform on chemosensitivity of oral cancer cells. METHODS: The expression of Mcl-1 isoforms- Mcl-1L, Mcl-1S & Mcl-1ES was analyzed in 130 paired oral tumors and 9 oral cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR & protein by western blotting. The Mcl-1 mRNA levels were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and outcome of oral cancer patients. The effect of Mcl-1L shRNA or Obatoclax (a small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitor), in combination with Cisplatin on chemosensitivity of oral cancer cells was also assessed. RESULTS: Anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L was predominantly expressed, over low or undetectable pro-apoptotic Mcl-1S and Mcl-1ES isoforms. The Mcl-1L transcripts were significantly overexpressed in all cancer cell lines and in 64% oral tumors versus adjacent normals (P<0.02). In oral cancer patients, high Mcl-1L expression was significantly associated with node positivity (P = 0.021), advanced tumor size (P = 0.013) and poor overall survival (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis indicated Mcl-1L to be an independent prognostic factor for oral cancers (P = 0.037). Mcl-1L shRNA knockdown or its inhibition by Obatoclax in combination with Cisplatin synergistically reduced viability and growth of oral cancer cells than either treatment alone. CONCLUSION: Our studies suggest that overexpression of Mcl-1L is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in oral cancers. Mcl-1L is an independent prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target in oral cancers.","['Palve, Vinayak', 'Mallick, Sanchita', 'Ghaisas, Gauri', 'Kannan, Sadhana', 'Teni, Tanuja']","['Palve V', 'Mallick S', 'Ghaisas G', 'Kannan S', 'Teni T']","['Teni Lab, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai-410210, India.', 'Teni Lab, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai-410210, India.', 'Teni Lab, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai-410210, India.', 'Epidemiology and Clinical Trial Unit (ECTU), Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai-410210, India.', 'Teni Lab, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai-410210, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141119,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111927 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-24629 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 19;9(11):e111927. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111927. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4237324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are some patients that develop a local failure. We have previously shown that Bcl-2 overexpression was associated with an increased risk of local recurrence in patients with early stage breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore an approach to overcome radiation resistance by targeting pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins in breast cancer cells. The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB231 were used in this study. siRNAs were employed to silence myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). A small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, ABT-737, was used to target anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Apoptosis was identified by FITC Annexin V, PI staining and Western blot analysis. The sensitivity to ionizing radiation and ABT-737 were measured by clonogenic assays. The effect of radiation and ABT-737 was also tested in a MCF-7 xenograft mouse model. Our data demonstrate that the combination of ABT-737 and radiation-induced apoptosis had an inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell proliferation. However, treatment with ABT-737 resulted in elevated Mcl-1 in breast cancer cell lines. Targeting Mcl-1 by siRNA sensitized MCF-7 cells to ABT-737. We revealed that radiation blunted Mcl-1 elevation induced by ABT-737, and that radiation downregulated Mcl-1 by promoting its degradation. Our results indicate that radiation and ABT-737 exert a synergistic effect on breast cancer cell lines through downregulating Mcl-1 and activating the bak-apoptotic pathway. These results support the combination of radiation and pro-survival Bcl-2 family inhibitor as a potential novel therapeutic strategy in the local-regional management of breast cancer.","['Wu, Hao', 'Schiff, Devora S', 'Lin, Yong', 'Neboori, Hanmanth J R', 'Goyal, Sharad', 'Feng, Zhaohui', 'Haffty, Bruce G']","['Wu H', 'Schiff DS', 'Lin Y', 'Neboori HJ', 'Goyal S', 'Feng Z', 'Haffty BG']","['a Department of Radiation Oncology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proteolysis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR13856.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2014 Dec;182(6):618-25. doi: 10.1667/RR13856.1.,,,['P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5523983,['NIHMS865115'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnostic assessment of this condition relies on the use of neuroradiology, conventional cytology (CC) and flow cytometry (FCM). Among these approaches, which is the gold standard it is still a matter of debate. Neuroradiology and CC have a limited sensitivity with a higher rate of false negative results. FCM demonstrated a superior sensitivity over CC, particularly when low levels of CNS infiltrating cells are present. Although prospective studies of a large series of patients are still awaited, a positive finding by FCM appears to anticipate an adverse outcome even if CC shows no infiltration. Current strategies for adult ALL CNS-directed prophylaxis or therapy involve systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy and radiation therapy. An early and frequent intrathecal injection of cytostatic combined with systemic chemotherapy is the most effective strategy to reduce the frequency of CNS involvement. In patients with CNS overt ALL, at diagnosis or upon relapse, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might be considered.

The non-relapse mortality of alloHSCT remains significantly higher compared with that of conventional chemotherapy. Therefore, one of the main challenges in the care of ALL is to establish a more precise prognostic definition to select patients who could take advantage from an alloHSCT. Currently, the use of minimal residual disease following induction and early consolidation therapy has improved the prognostic accuracy in defining ALL risk class. In Philadelphia-positive ALL, the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors pre and post alloHSCT appears to improve outcomes significantly and, in the absence of specially designed clinical trials, alloHSCT remains the most effective post-remission therapy. Nowadays, alloHSCT can be performed according to various modalities encompassing the use of different conditioning regimens, as well as distinct donors and stem cell source, with a significant accessibility to transplant.","['Lussana, Federico', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro']","['Lussana F', 'Rambaldi A']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141101,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,2014/11/20 06:00,2014/11/20 06:01,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2014.065 [doi]', 'mjhid-6-1-e2014065 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2014 Nov 1;6(1):e2014065. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2014.065. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4235484,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a rapid evaluation of the outcome in myelodysplastic patients non-cytogenetic prognostic scores can be used. AIM: This study proposed to demonstrate that age and gender are important factors in the outcome of the patients diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in the Department of Hematology of the Emergency University Hospital Bucharest during October 2008 and October 2012. RESULTS: Male sex and age higher than 60 years are associated with high risk in the studied cases by using the Spanish prognostic score. According to Goasguen score: male sex and age, patients older than 60 years, present characteristics associated with an intermediate risk. Based on the Dusseldorf score, age over 60 years and female gender were associated with pronounced risk in the examined group. By examining the Bournemouth score in our group, we found that age > 60 years correlated with a higher frequency of risk, but no significant differences regarding the sex of patients were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that age > 60 years and male gender are important predisposing factors in the survival.","['Cazaceanu, O', 'Vladareanu, Am', 'Bumbea, H', 'Begu, M', 'Onisai, M', 'Enache, C']","['Cazaceanu O', 'Vladareanu A', 'Bumbea H', 'Begu M', 'Onisai M', 'Enache C']","['University Emergency Hospital, Department of Hematology, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital, Department of Hematology, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital, Department of Hematology, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital, Department of Hematology, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital, Department of Hematology, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital, Department of Hematology, Bucharest, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20140925,Romania,J Med Life,Journal of medicine and life,101477617,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis', '*Research Design', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Romania/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Life. 2014 Sep 15;7(3):335-8.

In this study, we investigated whether inhibition of Bcl-xL influences cell growth and apoptosis against simultaneous treatment of resveratrol and clofarabine in the human malignant mesothelioma H-2452 cells. Resveratrol and clofarabine decreased Mcl-1 protein levels but had little effect on Bcl-xL levels. In the presence of two compounds, any detectable change in the Mcl-1 mRNA levels was not observed in RT-PCR analysis, whereas pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 led to its accumulation to levels far above basal levels. The knockdown of Bcl-xL inhibited cell proliferation with cell accumulation at G2/M phase and the appearance of sub-G0/G1 peak in DNA flow cytometric assay. The suppression of cell growth was accompanied by an increase in the caspase-3/7 activity with the resultant cleavages of procaspase-3 and its substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and increased percentage of apoptotic propensities in annexin V binding assay. Collectively, our data represent that the efficacy of resveratrol and clofarabine for apoptosis induction was substantially enhanced by Bcl-xL-lowering strategy in which the simultaneous targeting of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL could be a more effective strategy for treating malignant mesothelioma.","['Lee, Yoon-Jin', 'Hwang, In-Sung', 'Lee, Yong-Jin', 'Lee, Chang-Ho', 'Kim, Sung-Ho', 'Nam, Hae-Saeon', 'Choi, Young-Jin', 'Lee, Sang-Han']","['Lee YJ', 'Hwang IS', 'Lee YJ', 'Lee CH', 'Kim SH', 'Nam HS', 'Choi YJ', 'Lee SH']","['Soonchunhyung Environmental Health Center for Asbestos, Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital, Cheonan, Korea. ; Division of Molecular Cancer Research, Soonchunhyang Medical Research Institute, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Soonchunhyung Environmental Health Center for Asbestos, Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Department of Urology, Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, Soonchunhyang University, Asan, Korea.', 'Division of Molecular Cancer Research, Soonchunhyang Medical Research Institute, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Division of Molecular Cancer Research, Soonchunhyang Medical Research Institute, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Soonchunhyung Environmental Health Center for Asbestos, Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital, Cheonan, Korea. ; Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141104,Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clofarabine', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Mesothelioma/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesothelioma, Malignant', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/07/07 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3346/jkms.2014.29.11.1464 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2014 Nov;29(11):1464-72. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2014.29.11.1464.

Bone marrow (BM) stromal cells play a vital role in the development of chemoresistance in AML cells attached to the stroma. To investigate the effect of BM stroma adhesion induced AML resistance to A3D8, we developed a co-culture system composed of an AML-derived cell line (NB4) cultured with either a human BM stroma cell line (HS-5) or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We found that NB4 cells adhered to HS-5 cells or MSCs developed resistance against the anti-proliferative effects of A3D8, and this action is caused by the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling following p27(Kip1) down-regulation and cytoplasmic re-localization. The stromal co-culture-induced resistance can be partially abolished by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Such findings were confirmed in two additional AML-derived cell lines as well as in primary AML cells. Our results suggest that BM stroma can induce A3D8 resistance in part via the PI3K/Akt-p27(Kip1) axis, and blocking PI3K/Akt pathway maybe necessary for anti-CD44 treatment on AML in BM microenvironment.","['Chen, Ping', 'Huang, Huifang', 'Wu, Juanying', 'Lu, Rong', 'Wu, Yong', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Yuan, Qin', 'Chen, Yuanzhong']","['Chen P', 'Huang H', 'Wu J', 'Lu R', 'Wu Y', 'Jiang X', 'Yuan Q', 'Chen Y']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, P.R.

Identifying factors associated with different outcomes on inotuzumab therapy may help select patients for this treatment and advice of prognosis. A total of 89 patients treated with inotuzumab on previous studies were analyzed. Inotuzumab was given at 1.3-1.8 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) x 1 every 3-4 weeks or weekly (0.8 mg/m(2) day 1, 0.5 mg/m(2) days 8 and 15) every 3-4 weeks. Pretreatment factors associated with achieving marrow complete response (CR) and with survival were analyzed using standard statistical methods. The median survival of patients with at least marrow CR was 9.2 months versus 3.4 months for those without marrow CR (P < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, a high peripheral blood absolute blast count and low platelet count were independently associated with a lower likelihood of achieving at least marrow CR. Baseline characteristics independently associated with worse survival included adverse cytogenetics [complex karyotype, translocation (4;11), translocation (9;22), abnormal chromosome 17], disease beyond first salvage, and high peripheral blood absolute count. Patients with 0, 1-2, or 3 adverse factors had a median survival of 39+, 7.5, and 2.4 months, respectively.

Elucidating the mechanisms controlling HSCs self-renewal and differentiation is important for application of HSCs for research and clinical uses. However, it is not possible to obtain large quantity of HSCs due to their inability to proliferate in vitro. To overcome this hurdle, we used a mouse bone marrow derived cell line, the EML (Erythroid, Myeloid, and Lymphocytic) cell line, as a model system for this study. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) has been increasingly used to replace microarray for gene expression studies. We report here a detailed method of using RNA-Seq technology to investigate the potential key factors in regulation of EML cell self-renewal and differentiation. The protocol provided in this paper is divided into three parts. The first part explains how to culture EML cells and separate Lin-CD34+ and Lin-CD34- cells. The second part of the protocol offers detailed procedures for total RNA preparation and the subsequent library construction for high-throughput sequencing. The last part describes the method for RNA-Seq data analysis and explains how to use the data to identify differentially expressed transcription factors between Lin-CD34+ and Lin-CD34- cells. The most significantly differentially expressed transcription factors were identified to be the potential key regulators controlling EML cell self-renewal and differentiation. In the discussion section of this paper, we highlight the key steps for successful performance of this experiment. In summary, this paper offers a method of using RNA-Seq technology to identify potential regulators of self-renewal and differentiation in EML cells. The key factors identified are subjected to downstream functional analysis in vitro and in vivo.","['Zong, Shan', 'Deng, Shuyun', 'Chen, Kenian', 'Wu, Jia Qian']","['Zong S', 'Deng S', 'Chen K', 'Wu JQ']","['The Vivian L.

This study aims to evaluate if weight gain, early in therapy, is predictive of obesity at the end of treatment. PROCEDURE: In this secondary analysis, data from 1,017 high-risk ALL patients previously treated on a Children's Oncology Group protocol (CCG study 1961) were reviewed. Logistic regression was used to examine whether change in BMI z-score at Induction or Delayed Intensification (DI) 1 were predictive of obesity at the end of therapy. RESULTS: The BMI z-score at the beginning of Induction and the change in BMI z-score during Induction were both significant predictors of obesity at the end of therapy. The change in BMI z-score during cycle 1 of DI was not found to be associated with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: It is well know that obesity at the beginning of therapy is predictive of obesity at the end of ALL therapy. The new, and more important, finding from this study is that even after adjusting for baseline weight, the increase in BMI z-scores during induction was an independent predictor of obesity at the end of therapy. Most researchers agree that prevention is the best form of treatment for obesity as it is difficult to reverse once it is present. This study suggests that monitoring weight trends during Induction may be useful in guiding healthcare practitioners in identifying which patients are at highest risk for obesity development so that early intervention may occur.","['Withycombe, Janice S', 'Smith, Lynette M', 'Meza, Jane L', 'Merkle, Carrie', 'Faulkner, Melissa Spezia', 'Ritter, Leslie', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Moore, Ki']","['Withycombe JS', 'Smith LM', 'Meza JL', 'Merkle C', 'Faulkner MS', 'Ritter L', 'Seibel NL', 'Moore K']","[""Children's Cancer Center, Palmetto Health, Columbia, South Carolina.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141118,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', '*Obesity/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Weight Gain/*drug effects']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25316 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Mar;62(3):434-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25316.

Intensification of therapy has resulted in fewer relapses but increased early deaths, resulting in failure to improve survival. PROCEDURE: AALL0631 is a Phase 3 study for infants (<366 days of age) with newly diagnosed ALL. Induction initially (Cohort 1) consisted of 3 weeks of therapy based on COG P9407. Due to excessive early mortality, induction was amended to a less intensive 5 weeks of therapy based on Interfant-99. Additionally, enhanced supportive care guidelines were incorporated with hospitalization during induction until evidence of marrow recovery and recommendations for prevention/treatment of infections (Cohort 2). RESULTS: Induction mortality was significantly lower for patients in Cohort 2 (2/123, 1.6%) versus Cohort 1 (4/26, 15.4%; P = 0.009). All induction deaths were infection related except one due to progressive disease (Cohort 2). Sterile site infections were lower for patients in Cohort 2 (24/123, 19.5%) versus Cohort 1 (15/26, 57.7%; P = 0.0002), with a significantly lower rate of Gram positive infections during induction for patients in Cohort 2, P = 0.0002. No clinically significant differences in grades 3-5 non-infectious toxicities were observed between the two cohorts. Higher complete response rates were observed at end induction intensification for Cohort 2 (week 9, 94/100, 94%) versus Cohort 1 (week 7, 17/25, 68%; P = 0.0.0012). CONCLUSION: De-intensification of induction therapy and enhanced supportive care guidelines significantly decreased induction mortality and sterile site infections, without decreasing complete remission rates.","['Salzer, Wanda L', 'Jones, Tamekia L', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Gore, Lia', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Wang, Cindy Y', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Salzer WL', 'Jones TL', 'Devidas M', 'Dreyer ZE', 'Gore L', 'Winick NJ', 'Sung L', 'Raetz E', 'Loh ML', 'Wang CY', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Pieters R', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP', 'Hilden JM', 'Brown P']","['U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Detrick, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141118,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/etiology/*mortality', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25311 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Mar;62(3):414-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25311.

The aims of this study was to ascertain if saliva RNA could be stored at room temperature and to study if saliva could be a convenient source for fusion transcripts in leukemic patients. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional diagnostic study. We first developed a Saliva RNA tube for stable storage of whole saliva RNA at room temperature. Then we detected the leukemic fusions in the whole saliva from seven leukemic patients and twenty healthy volunteers, and compared with the results obtained from the bone marrow of the patients. RESULTS: Human gene transcripts could be reproducibly detected in the whole saliva for at least four weeks when stored in the developed composition at room temperature. Concordant results of the fusion transcripts were obtained between the saliva and the bone marrow in the seven leukemic patients and no fusions were detected in the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: The results support our hypothesis that human whole saliva could be a reliable and convenient sampling source for the detection of leukemic fusions.","['Chen, Dongmei', 'Song, Najie', 'Ni, Runfang', 'Zhao, Jiangning', 'Hu, Jiasheng', 'Lu, Quanyi', 'Li, Qingge']","['Chen D', 'Song N', 'Ni R', 'Zhao J', 'Hu J', 'Lu Q', 'Li Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, Engineering Research Centre of Molecular Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China. dmchen@stu.xmu.edu.cn.', 'Shenzhen Research Institute of Xiamen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518057, China. dmchen@stu.xmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, Engineering Research Centre of Molecular Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China. songnajie@xmu.edu.cn.', 'Shenzhen Research Institute of Xiamen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518057, China. songnajie@xmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, Engineering Research Centre of Molecular Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China. runfangni@gmail.com.', 'Shenzhen Research Institute of Xiamen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518057, China. runfangni@gmail.com.', 'Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361004, China. zjn@xmzsh.com.', 'Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361004, China. hujiasheng@xmzsh.com.', 'Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361004, China. quanyilu@hotmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, Engineering Research Centre of Molecular Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China. qgli@xmu.edu.cn.', 'Shenzhen Research Institute of Xiamen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518057, China. qgli@xmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141119,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Saliva/*metabolism']",2014/11/20 06:00,2016/02/27 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-014-0321-z [doi]', 's12967-014-0321-z [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 Nov 19;12:321. doi: 10.1186/s12967-014-0321-z.,,,,PMC4243783,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the diagnostic value of anti-cmDNA antibodies with that of antinucleosome antibodies (AnuA), anti-Sm antibodies, and anti-dsDNA antibodies and human B lymphocyte Raji cells with that of human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells as substrates in an indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-cmDNA antibodies in JSLE patients. METHODS: We recruited 92 JSLE patients and 71 patients with other juvenile-onset rheumatic diseases. Anti-cmDNA antibodies and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected in patient sera using indirect immunofluorescence assays. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected by combining ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence. Anti-Sm antibodies were detected by double immunodiffusion assay and immunoblotting, while AnuA were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: The JSLE group had a significantly higher percentage of patients positive for anti-cmDNA compared to patients with other rheumatoid diseases. Using one antibody for diagnosis, anti-cm DNA antibodies had the highest accuracy at 84.0%; using two antibodies, the combination of anti-cm DNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies had 90.8% accuracy. Raji cells used as substrate demonstrated a stronger intensity of fluorescent patterns compared to HL60 cells.

We studied a large number of different types of primary CTCL for expression of Tfh markers, including 36 biopsies from 21 patients with MF (with sequential biopsies from patch stage and tumor stage of 15 patients), 13 patients with CD4SMTCL, 9 with lymphomatoid papulosis, 11 with cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (cALCL), 2 with cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma, 8 with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, 3 with cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8 cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, 6 with cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, and 1 with Sezary syndrome.

Our study shows that a Tfh phenotype is very common in MF and CD4SMTCL but can be observed rarely also in other types of CTCL. Expression of Tfh markers should not be used for classification of any entity of CTCL and may only integrate other immunohistochemical stainings for a more accurate characterization of these disorders. Precise distinction of Tfh-positive CTCLs from secondary skin manifestations of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma cannot rest on demonstration of a Tfh phenotype alone and should be achieved by a synthesis of clinical, histological, and phenotypic features.","['Bosisio, Francesca M', 'Cerroni, Lorenzo']","['Bosisio FM', 'Cerroni L']","['*Research Unit of Dermatopathology, Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Austria; and daggerDepartment of Surgical Sciences, Milano-Bicocca State University, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*immunology/pathology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Panniculitis/immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sezary Syndrome/immunology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/DAD.0000000000000258 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2015 Feb;37(2):115-21. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0000000000000258.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The targeted tumor cell populations are first preprogrammed to immobilization into an array format, and labeled with green fluorescent cytosolic dyes. Following the cell array formation, antibody drugs are added in combination with human whole blood. Propidium iodide (PI) is then added to assess cell death. The cell array is analyzed with an automatic imaging system. While cytosolic dye labels the targeted tumor cell populations, PI labels the dead tumor cell populations. Thus, the percentage of target cancer cell killing can be quantified by calculating the number of surviving targeted cells to the number of dead targeted cells. With this method, researchers are able to access time-dependent and dose-dependent cell cytotoxicity information. Remarkably, no hazardous radiochemicals are used. The WCA presented here has been tested with lymphoma, leukemia, and solid tumor cell lines. Therefore, WCA allows researchers to assess drug efficacy in a highly relevant ex vivo condition.","['Hsiao, Ching-Wen', 'Lo, Yen-Ting', 'Liu, Hong', 'Hsiao, Sonny C']","['Hsiao CW', 'Lo YT', 'Liu H', 'Hsiao SC']","['Research and Development, Adheren, Inc.', 'Research and Development, Adheren, Inc.', 'Research and Development, Eureka Therapeutics.', 'Research and Development, Adheren, Inc; sonny@adheren.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Video-Audio Media']",20141107,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blood', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Immobilized', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Propidium/chemistry']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/07/01 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/51941 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2014 Nov 7;(93):e51941. doi: 10.3791/51941.,,,"['R33 CA174616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA174616-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4353432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence of the high affinity binding between IgE and FcepsilonRI, along with the continuous production of IgE by B cells, allergies usually persist throughout life, with currently no permanent cure available. Horses, especially race horses, which are commonly inbred, are a species of mammals that are very prone to the development of hypersensitivity responses, which can seriously affect their performance. Physiological responses to allergic sensitization in horses mirror that observed in humans and dogs. In this paper we describe the development of an in situ assay system for the quantitative assessment of the release of mediators of the allergic response pertaining to the equine system. To this end, the gene encoding equine FcepsilonRIalpha was transfected into and expressed onto the surface of parental Rat Basophil Leukemia (RBL-2H3.1) cells. The gene product of the transfected equine alpha-chain formed a functional receptor complex with the endogenous rat beta- and gamma-chains. The resultant assay system facilitated an assessment of the quantity of mediator secreted from equine FcepsilonRIalpha transfected RBL-2H3.1 cells following sensitization with equine IgE and antigenic challenge using beta-hexosaminidase release as a readout. Mediator release peaked at 36.68% +/- 4.88% at 100 ng ml(-1) of antigen. This assay was modified from previous assays used to study human and canine allergic responses. We have also shown that this type of assay system has multiple applications for the development of diagnostic tools and the safety assessment of potential therapeutic intervention strategies in allergic disease.","['Sabban, Sari', 'Ye, Hongtu', 'Helm, Birgit']","['Sabban S', 'Ye H', 'Helm B']","['Biological Department, King Abdulaziz University; sari.sabban@gmail.com.', 'The Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, The University of Sheffield.', 'The Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, The University of Sheffield.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20141101,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dogs', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/genetics/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/immunology/metabolism']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/52222 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2014 Nov 1;(93):e52222. doi: 10.3791/52222.,,,,PMC4541457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant stable molecule of the allergen is thus needed to improve the diagnosis of allergy and the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The current study reports the immunological characterization of two recombinant molecules of the HDM allergen Der p 3 as useful tools for diagnosis and immunotherapy. METHODS: Recombinant mature (rDer p 3) and immature (proDer p 3) Der p 3 and their corresponding S196A mutants were produced in Pichia pastoris and purified. The stability, IgE-binding capacity and allergenicity of the different proteins were analysed and compared with those of the major mite allergen Der p 1 used as a reference. Additionally, the immunogenicity of the different allergens was evaluated in a murine model of Der p 3 sensitization. RESULTS: Compared to the IgE reactivity to recombinant and natural Der p 3 (nDer p 3), the mean IgE binding of patient's sera to rDer p 3-S196A (50%) was higher. The poorly binding to nDer p 3 or rDer p 3 was due to autolysis of the allergen. Contrary to Der p 3, proDer p 3 displayed very weak IgE reactivity, as measured by sandwich ELISA and competitive inhibition, rat basophil leukaemia degranulation and human basophil activation assays. Moreover, proDer p 3 induced a TH 1-biased immune response that prevented allergic response in mice but retained Der p 3-specific T-cell reactivity. CONCLUSION: rDer p 3-S196A should be used for the diagnosis of HDM allergy elicited by Der p 3, and proDer p 3 may represent a hypoallergen of Der p 3.","['Bouaziz, A', 'Walgraffe, D', 'Bouillot, C', 'Herman, J', 'Foguenne, J', 'Gothot, A', 'Louis, R', 'Hentges, F', 'Jacquet, A', 'Mailleux, A-C', 'Chevigne, A', 'Galleni, M', 'Adam, E', 'Dumez, M-E']","['Bouaziz A', 'Walgraffe D', 'Bouillot C', 'Herman J', 'Foguenne J', 'Gothot A', 'Louis R', 'Hentges F', 'Jacquet A', 'Mailleux AC', 'Chevigne A', 'Galleni M', 'Adam E', 'Dumez ME']","[""Macromolecules Biologiques, Centre d'ingenierie des Proteines, Universite de Liege, Liege, Belgium.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Dermatophagoides)', '0 (Arthropod Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus antigen p 3)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Allergens/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Dermatophagoides/*immunology/metabolism', 'Arthropod Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Basophils/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', '*Immunotherapy', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*immunology/metabolism']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cea.12452 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2015 Apr;45(4):823-34. doi: 10.1111/cea.12452.,['NOTNLM'],"['Der p 3', 'diagnosis', 'hypoallergen', 'inactive enzyme', 'recombinant mite allergen', 'specific immunotherapy']",,,,,,['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This implies that only a few miRNAs can function as effective tumor suppressors. It is also the basis of our strategy to define functionally relevant miRNA target genes that are not under redundant control by other miRNAs. We identified a functionally interconnected group of miRNAs that exhibited a reduced abundance in leukemia cells from patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To pinpoint relevant target genes, we applied a machine learning approach to eliminate genes that were subject to redundant miRNA-mediated control and to identify those genes that were exclusively targeted by tumor-suppressive miRNAs. This strategy revealed the convergence of a small group of tumor suppressor miRNAs on the Myb oncogene, as well as their effects on HBP1, which encodes a transcription factor. The expression of both genes was increased in T-ALL patient samples, and each gene promoted the progression of T-ALL in mice. Hence, our systematic analysis of tumor suppressor miRNA action identified a widespread mechanism of oncogene activation in T-ALL.","['Sanghvi, Viraj R', 'Mavrakis, Konstantinos J', 'Van der Meulen, Joni', 'Boice, Michael', 'Wolfe, Andrew L', 'Carty, Mark', 'Mohan, Prathibha', 'Rondou, Pieter', 'Socci, Nicholas D', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Leslie, Christina S', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Wendel, Hans-Guido']","['Sanghvi VR', 'Mavrakis KJ', 'Van der Meulen J', 'Boice M', 'Wolfe AL', 'Carty M', 'Mohan P', 'Rondou P', 'Socci ND', 'Benoit Y', 'Taghon T', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Leslie CS', 'Speleman F', 'Wendel HG']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

Most patients respond to immunosuppressive therapies, but a minority transform to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), frequently associated with monosomy 7 (-7). Thirteen SAA patients were analyzed for acquired mutations in myeloid cells at the time of evolution to -7, and all had a dominant HSPC clone bearing specific acquired mutations. However, mutations in genes associated with MDS/AML were present in only 4 cases. Patients who evolved to MDS and AML showed marked progressive telomere attrition before the emergence of -7. Single telomere length analysis confirmed accumulation of short telomere fragments of individual chromosomes. Our results indicate that accelerated telomere attrition in the setting of a decreased HSPC pool is characteristic of early myeloid oncogenesis, specifically chromosome 7 loss, in MDS/AML after SAA, and provides a possible mechanism for development of aneuploidy.","['Dumitriu, Bogdan', 'Feng, Xingmin', 'Townsley, Danielle M', 'Ueda, Yasutaka', 'Yoshizato, Tetsuichi', 'Calado, Rodrigo T', 'Yang, Yanqin', 'Wakabayashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Kajigaya, Sachiko', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Young, Neal S']","['Dumitriu B', 'Feng X', 'Townsley DM', 'Ueda Y', 'Yoshizato T', 'Calado RT', 'Yang Y', 'Wakabayashi Y', 'Kajigaya S', 'Ogawa S', 'Zhu J', 'Young NS']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; and.', 'DNA Sequencing and Computational Biology Core, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'DNA Sequencing and Computational Biology Core, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'DNA Sequencing and Computational Biology Core, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20141118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['Chromosome 7, monosomy']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Telomere Homeostasis']",2014/11/20 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39511-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-607572 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 22;125(4):706-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-607572.

However, despite similarities in morphology, immunophenotype, and differentiation behavior in vitro, MSCs sourced from distinct tissues do not necessarily have equivalent biological properties. We performed a genome-wide methylation, transcription, and in vivo evaluation of MSCs from human bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue, umbilical cord, and skin cultured in humanized media. Surprisingly, only BM-derived MSCs spontaneously formed a BM cavity through a vascularized cartilage intermediate in vivo that was progressively replaced by hematopoietic tissue and bone. Only BM-derived MSCs exhibited a chondrogenic transcriptional program with hypomethylation and increased expression of RUNX3, RUNX2, BGLAP, MMP13, and ITGA10 consistent with a latent and primed skeletal developmental potential. The humanized MSC-derived microenvironment permitted homing and maintenance of long-term murine SLAM(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as well as human CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD90(+)/CD45RA(+) HSCs after cord blood transplantation. These studies underscore the profound differences in developmental potential between MSC sources independent of donor age, with implications for their clinical use. We also demonstrate a tractable human niche model for studying homing and engraftment of human hematopoietic cells in normal and neoplastic states.","['Reinisch, Andreas', 'Etchart, Nathalie', 'Thomas, Daniel', 'Hofmann, Nicole A', 'Fruehwirth, Margareta', 'Sinha, Subarna', 'Chan, Charles K', 'Senarath-Yapa, Kshemendra', 'Seo, Eun-Young', 'Wearda, Taylor', 'Hartwig, Udo F', 'Beham-Schmid, Christine', 'Trajanoski, Slave', 'Lin, Qiong', 'Wagner, Wolfgang', 'Dullin, Christian', 'Alves, Frauke', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Weissman, Irving L', 'Longaker, Michael T', 'Schallmoser, Katharina', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Strunk, Dirk']","['Reinisch A', 'Etchart N', 'Thomas D', 'Hofmann NA', 'Fruehwirth M', 'Sinha S', 'Chan CK', 'Senarath-Yapa K', 'Seo EY', 'Wearda T', 'Hartwig UF', 'Beham-Schmid C', 'Trajanoski S', 'Lin Q', 'Wagner W', 'Dullin C', 'Alves F', 'Andreeff M', 'Weissman IL', 'Longaker MT', 'Schallmoser K', 'Majeti R', 'Strunk D']","['Stem Cell Research Unit and Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria;

The main conclusion of the present study was that PNAs designed to target adult murine beta-globin mRNA inhibit hemoglobin accumulation and erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells with high efficiency and fair selectivity. No major effects were observed on cell proliferation.

The mRNA expression levels of the full-length of MDM4 (MDM4FL) and short isoform MDM4 (MDM4S) were elevated in CK-AML relative to normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) patients. We also explored the impact of MDM4 overexpression on the cell cycle, cell proliferation and the spindle checkpoint of HepG2 cells, which is a human cancer cell line with normal MDM4 and TP53 expression. The mitotic index and the expression of p21, BubR1 and Securin were all reduced following Nocodazole treatment. Moreover, karyotype analysis showed that MDM4 overexpression might lead to aneuploidy or polyploidy. These results suggest that MDM4 overexpression is related to CK-AML with wild-type TP53 and might play a pathogenic role by inhibiting p53-signal pathway.","['Li, Li', 'Tan, Yanhong', 'Chen, Xiuhua', 'Xu, Zhifang', 'Yang, Siyao', 'Ren, Fanggang', 'Guo, Haixiu', 'Wang, Xiaojuan', 'Chen, Yi', 'Li, Guoxia', 'Wang, Hongwei']","['Li L', 'Tan Y', 'Chen X', 'Xu Z', 'Yang S', 'Ren F', 'Guo H', 'Wang X', 'Chen Y', 'Li G', 'Wang H']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, P.R.

It has also shown potential for treatment of multiple myeloma and various solid tumors including breast cancer. The requirement of high, toxic concentrations for the induction of apoptosis in non-APL and solid tumor cells is a major limitation for its use in other hematological malignancies and solid tumors. We have examined whether inducers of differentiation of leukemia cells can control the growth of solid tumor cells. In the present study, we found that cotylenin A, a plant growth regulator and a potent inducer of differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells, significantly potentiated both ATO-induced inhibition of cell growth in a liquid culture, and ATO-induced inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in a semi-solid culture in human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. ISIR-005 (a synthetic cotylenin A-derivative) was also able to enhance ATO-induced growth inhibition. The combined treatment with cotylenin A and ATO induced cleaved caspase-7 in MCF-7 cells at the concentrations which ATO alone scarcely induced and cotylenin A alone only weakly induced. Expression of survivin in MCF-7 cells was markedly decreased with the presence of both cotylenin A and ATO, although the expression of survivin was only slightly decreased by cotylenin A or ATO alone. The pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine significantly reduced the combination treatment-induced cell growth inhibition. These data suggest that induction of cleaved caspase-7, inhibition of survivin and oxidative responses are important events in the corporative inhibition in the growth of MCF-7 cells induced by both cotylenin A and ATO. Furthermore, we found that the combined treatment with cotylenin A and ATO also could be effective in suppressing the invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells determined with the impedance-based xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis technology. These results suggest that cotylenin A is an attractive enhancer for the ATO-induced anticancer activities in human breast cancer.","['Kasukabe, Takashi', 'Okabe-Kado, Junko', 'Kato, Nobuo', 'Honma, Yoshio', 'Kumakura, Shunichi']","['Kasukabe T', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Kato N', 'Honma Y', 'Kumakura S']","['Department of Medical Education and Research, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo 693-8501, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama 362-0806, Japan.', 'Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka 567-0047, Japan.', 'Cancer Center, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo 693-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo 693-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141118,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (cotylenin A)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/pathology', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage']",2014/11/19 06:00,2015/08/22 06:00,['2014/11/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2760 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 Feb;46(2):841-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2760.

Recently exome sequencing of individuals with ID identified novel genes implicated in the disease. Therefore the purpose of the present study was to identify the genetic cause of ID in one syndromic and two non-syndromic Pakistani families. Whole exome of three ID probands was sequenced. Missense variations in two plausible novel genes implicated in autosomal recessive ID were identified: lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B), zinc finger protein 589 (ZNF589), as well as hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) with a de novo mutation with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The KMT2B recessive variant is the first report of recessive Kleefstra syndrome-like phenotype. Identification of plausible causative mutations for two recessive and a dominant type of ID, in genes not previously implicated in disease, underscores the large genetic heterogeneity of ID. These results also support the viewpoint that large number of ID genes converge on limited number of common networks i.e. ZNF589 belongs to KRAB-domain zinc-finger proteins previously implicated in ID, HHAT is predicted to affect sonic hedgehog, which is involved in several disorders with ID, KMT2B associated with syndromic ID fits the epigenetic module underlying the Kleefstra syndromic spectrum. The association of these novel genes in three different Pakistani ID families highlights the importance of screening these genes in more families with similar phenotypes from different populations to confirm the involvement of these genes in pathogenesis of ID.","['Agha, Zehra', 'Iqbal, Zafar', 'Azam, Maleeha', 'Ayub, Humaira', 'Vissers, Lisenka E L M', 'Gilissen, Christian', 'Ali, Syeda Hafiza Benish', 'Riaz, Moeen', 'Veltman, Joris A', 'Pfundt, Rolph', 'van Bokhoven, Hans', 'Qamar, Raheel']","['Agha Z', 'Iqbal Z', 'Azam M', 'Ayub H', 'Vissers LE', 'Gilissen C', 'Ali SH', 'Riaz M', 'Veltman JA', 'Pfundt R', 'van Bokhoven H', 'Qamar R']","['Department of Biosciences, Faculty of Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biosciences, Faculty of Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biosciences, Faculty of Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biosciences, Faculty of Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biosciences, Faculty of Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Cognitive Neurosciences, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biosciences, Faculty of Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; Department of Biochemistry, Al-Nafees Medical College & Hospital, Isra University, Islamabad, Pakistan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZNF589 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (HHAT protein, human)', 'Kleefstra Syndrome']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities/*genetics', '*Exome', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics']",2014/11/19 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2014/11/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0112687 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-32520 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 18;9(11):e112687. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0112687. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4236113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FA, dyskeratosis congenita (DC), and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) are inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) associated with high risks of bone marrow failure, leukemia, and solid tumors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess AMH levels in females with DC or DBA. DESIGN AND SETTING: This observational study used the National Cancer Institute's inherited bone marrow failure syndrome cohort at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. PARTICIPANTS: The study included females with DC, unaffected female relatives of patients with DC, females with DBA, unaffected female relatives of patients with DBA, and unrelated healthy female volunteers younger than 41 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum AMH levels were measured. RESULTS: Females with DC had significantly lower levels of AMH (median 0.55 ng/mL) compared with unaffected relatives (median 2.28 ng/mL, P = .004) or unrelated healthy volunteers (median 2.69 ng/mL, P = .005). Females with DBA showed a nonsignificant trend for lower levels of AMH (median 0.89 ng/mL) compared with unaffected relatives (median 1.71 ng/mL, P = .21) or unrelated healthy volunteers (P = .11). Patients with DC and DBA had significantly higher levels of AMH (P = .013, P = .003) compared with FA (median 0.05 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that women with IBMFS have lower levels of AMH than unaffected women. This AMH deficiency could be a primary ovarian defect or a consequence of the pathophysiology of the syndromes. Additional studies of AMH and ovarian function in women with IBMFS are warranted to better understand the underlying biology.","['Sklavos, Martha M', 'Stratton, Pamela', 'Giri, Neelam', 'Alter, Blanche P', 'Savage, Sharon A', 'Pinto, Ligia A']","['Sklavos MM', 'Stratton P', 'Giri N', 'Alter BP', 'Savage SA', 'Pinto LA']","['Human Papillomavirus Immunology Laboratory (M.M.S., L.A.P.), Leidos Biomedical Research, Incorporated, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, Maryland 21702; Program in Reproductive and Adult Endocrinology (P.S.), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892; and Clinical Genetics Branch (N.G., B.P.A., S.A.S.), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20852.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141118,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '80497-65-0 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan/*blood', 'Anti-Mullerian Hormone/*blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/19 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/11/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1210/jc.2014-2838 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2015 Feb;100(2):E197-203. doi: 10.1210/jc.2014-2838.

The gold standard for treatment of ALL in children is with a class of drugs known as the antracyclines. Long term outcomes following treatment of leukemia with antracylines can result in cardiac abnormalities including arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, hypertension and left ventricular failure. Thymoquinone is a natural product that has demonstrated anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and chemo-protective effects in control trials as well as a reduction in cardiotoxicity in antracyline treated rats. The aims of the study were to determine if thymoqunione could be used to reduce leukemia cell viability without injuring primary cardiomyocyte, and to determine its effects if used in conjunction with a known chemotherapeutic agent. Cellular viability and morphological changes were observed in the, RAW leukemia cells and cardiac myocytes following treatment with thymoquinone, antracyline (doxorubicin), alone and in combination for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The results suggest that thymoquinone treatment in RAW leukemia cells reduced the cell number without altering the morphology, while doxorubicin reduced cell number and induced spindle cell formation and increased cellular damage. Findings also suggest RAW cell apoptosis increased in combination therapy with thymoquinone and doxorubicin. Thymoquinone administered to cardiomyocytes showed similar morphological changes as control over time in culture; whereas doxorubicin treated cells showed evidence of loss of connectivity and disruption of cell membranes. Combination treatment with doxorubicin and thymoquinone demonstrated significant cardiac myocyte survival at concentrations when used alone were able to reduce the leukemia cells. Overall, the data is promising and may provide a treatment regime to protect the heart tissue. Additional work is warrant to understand the mechanisms involved to reduce cardio toxicity by combining thymoquinone with doxorubicin.","['Brown, R Keith', 'Wilson, Gerri', 'Tucci, Michelle A', 'Benghuzzi, Hamed A']","['Brown RK', 'Wilson G', 'Tucci MA', 'Benghuzzi HA']","['University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biomed Sci Instrum,Biomedical sciences instrumentation,0140524,,,,2014/11/19 06:00,2014/11/19 06:01,['2014/11/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Biomed Sci Instrum. 2014;50:391-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis of oncogenic protein Mcl1-expressing cells is mainly regulated by Noxa-mediated degradation of Mcl1. We wanted to elucidate the status of Noxa in H. pylori-infected GECs. For this, various GECs such as AGS, MKN45, and KATO III were either infected with H. pylori or left uninfected. The effect of infection was examined by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, in vitro binding assay, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. Infected GECs, surgical samples collected from patients with gastric adenocarcinoma as well as biopsy samples from patients infected with H. pylori showed significant up-regulation of both Mcl1 and Noxa compared with noninfected samples. Coexistence of Mcl1 and Noxa was indicative of an impaired Mcl-Noxa interaction. We proved that Noxa was phosphorylated at Ser(13) residue by JNK in infected GECs, which caused cytoplasmic retention of Noxa. JNK inhibition enhanced Mcl1-Noxa interaction in the mitochondrial fraction of infected cells, whereas overexpression of nonphosphorylatable Noxa resulted in enhanced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the infected epithelium. Because phosphorylation-dephosphorylation can regulate the apoptotic function of Noxa, this could be a potential target molecule for future treatment approaches for H. pylori-induced gastric cancer.","['Rath, Suvasmita', 'Das, Lopamudra', 'Kokate, Shrikant Babanrao', 'Pratheek, B M', 'Chattopadhyay, Subhasis', 'Goswami, Chandan', 'Chattopadhyay, Ranajoy', 'Crowe, Sheila Eileen', 'Bhattacharyya, Asima']","['Rath S', 'Das L', 'Kokate SB', 'Pratheek BM', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Goswami C', 'Chattopadhyay R', 'Crowe SE', 'Bhattacharyya A']","['*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '*National Institute of Science Education and Research, School of Biological Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; and Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA asima@niser.ac.in.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141117,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology/virology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism', 'Helicobacter Infections/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Helicobacter pylori/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mitochondria', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach/*pathology/virology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology/virology']",2014/11/19 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2014/11/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.14-257501 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.14-257501 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2015 Mar;29(3):796-806. doi: 10.1096/fj.14-257501.

As a result, mTOR controls cell growth and survival, and also shapes different effector functions of the cells including immune cells such as T cells. We demonstrate in this article that invariant NKT (iNKT) cell development is controlled by mTORC2 in a cell-intrinsic manner. In mice deficient in mTORC2 signaling because of the conditional deletion of the Rictor gene, iNKT cell numbers were reduced in the thymus and periphery. This is caused by decreased proliferation of stage 1 iNKT cells and poor development through subsequent stages. Functionally, iNKT cells devoid of mTORC2 signaling showed reduced number of IL-4-expressing cells, which correlated with a decrease in the transcription factor GATA-3-expressing cells. However, promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF), a critical transcription factor for iNKT cell development, is expressed at a similar level in mTORC2-deficient iNKT cells compared with that in the wild type iNKT cells. Furthermore, cellular localization of PLZF was not altered in the absence of mTOR2 signaling. Thus, our study reveals the PLZF-independent mechanisms of the development and function of iNKT cells regulated by mTORC2.","['Prevot, Nicolas', 'Pyaram, Kalyani', 'Bischoff, Evan', 'Sen, Jyoti Misra', 'Powell, Jonathan D', 'Chang, Cheong-Hee']","['Prevot N', 'Pyaram K', 'Bischoff E', 'Sen JM', 'Powell JD', 'Chang CH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109;', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109;', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109;', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224; and.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; heechang@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20141117,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '0 (rictor protein, mouse)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-17/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*immunology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*immunology']",2014/11/19 06:00,2016/02/27 06:00,['2014/11/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1401985 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1401985 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Jan 1;194(1):223-30. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401985.

We evaluated the roles of T-bet and IFN-gamma in T cell responses in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and found that T-bet(-/-) T cells induced significantly less GVHD compared with wild-type or IFN-gamma(-/-) counterparts in both MHC-mismatched and MHC-matched but minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched models driven by CD4 T cells. T-bet(-/-), but not IFN-gamma(-/-), CD4 T cells had a markedly reduced ability to cause tissue damage in liver and gut. This distinct outcome is reflected by the differential gene expression on donor CD4 T cells deficient for T-bet or IFN-gamma. At mRNA and protein levels, we defined several T-bet-dependent molecules that may account for the impaired ability of T-bet(-/-) T cells to migrate into target organs and to produce Th1-related cytokines. Moreover, these molecules were independent of either endogenous IFN-gamma, such as CXCR3 and programmed death-1, or systematic IFN-gamma, such as NKG2D, I-A(b), and granzyme B. Although both T-bet(-/-) and IFN-gamma(-/-) CD4 T cells are prone to differentiate into Th17 cells, polarized Th17 cells deficient for T-bet but not for IFN-gamma had a significantly reduced ability to cause GVHD. Finally, T-bet(-/-) T cells had a compromised graft-versus-leukemia effect, which could be essentially reversed by neutralization of IL-17 in the recipients. We conclude that T-bet is required for Th1 differentiation and migration, as well as for optimal function of Th17 cells. Thus, targeting T-bet or regulating its downstream effectors independent of IFN-gamma may be a promising strategy to control GVHD in the clinic.","['Fu, Jianing', 'Wang, Dapeng', 'Yu, Yu', 'Heinrichs, Jessica', 'Wu, Yongxia', 'Schutt, Steven', 'Kaosaard, Kane', 'Liu, Chen', 'Haarberg, Kelley', 'Bastian, David', 'McDonald, Daniel G', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong']","['Fu J', 'Wang D', 'Yu Y', 'Heinrichs J', 'Wu Y', 'Schutt S', 'Kaosaard K', 'Liu C', 'Haarberg K', 'Bastian D', 'McDonald DG', 'Anasetti C', 'Yu XZ']","['Cancer Biology Ph.D. Program, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612; Immunology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

Despite significant improvement in the treatment of T-ALL, approximately 20% of children and most adults succumb to resistant or relapsed disease. Transformation events occur during crucial steps of thymocyte development and have been related to the expression of certain oncogenes such as TAL2, TLX1, LYL1, LMO1, and NOTCH1. Mutations that lead to constitutive activation of NOTCH1 are most commonly found in human patients with T-ALL. Moreover, overexpression of the intracellular portion of NOTCH1 can lead to the initiation of T-ALL in mouse models. These findings suggest that NOTCH1 may promote tumorigenesis through the regulation of differentiation of leukemic cells, and, potentially, of leukemia-initiating cell identity and function. Multiple studies and clinical trials aimed at targeting NOTCH1 in T-ALL or using NOTCH1 mutations as a prognostic tool are currently underway.

Activation of this pathway induces tumor suppressors, including p53, and leads to inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, which often is overactivated in multiple cancers. Thus, the Lkb1/AMPK pathway suppresses cancer by negatively regulating cell proliferation. However, recent studies of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) revealed that Lkb1 is critical for maintaining HSCs, rather than limiting their proliferation. Furthermore, the role of AMPK in cancer cells has remained elusive. Outstanding questions concern the role of the Lkb1/AMPK pathway in regulating the metabolism and proliferation of cancer cells within a physiological setting. This review focuses on the function of the Lkb1/AMPK pathway in HSCs and leukemia and provides an overview of the therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting this pathway in cancer.","['Saito, Yusuke', 'Nakada, Daisuke']","['Saito Y', 'Nakada D']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Crit Rev Oncog,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (STK11 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.3 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",2014/11/19 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/11/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1f524cb22209e814,5d163e970936bee1 [pii]', '10.1615/critrevoncog.2014011765 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncog. 2014;19(5):383-97. doi: 10.1615/critrevoncog.2014011765.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety-four patients received an initial 6-MP dose in the range of 30-50 mg m(-2) in this analysis. Patients with homozygous variant allele in any of MRP4 G2269A, C912A and G559T required high frequency of 6-MP dose reduction compared with non-homozygous individuals.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 96 children (63 boys and 33 girls), aged 3-12 years, with hematological malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Mental disorders were presented with a wide range of violations, including the endogenous pathology (8 children), a mild degree of mental retardation (n=2), adjustment disorders (n=86). Adjustment (adaptation) disorders included an diety, phobic and depressive reactions. The appearance, form and severity of disorders were influenced by a range of factors, which had a different contribution to the process. Family history, premorbid personality traits, interpersonal relationships within the family and the type of education seem to be less important compared to the age of the patients that determined the preferred range of disorders, forming the leading psichogenic symptoms.","['Khodakova, Iu A']",['Khodakova IuA'],,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

The aim of the study was the immunophenotypic characterization of bone marrow cells from patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome to assess the maturation pathway of blood progenitor cells and to identify the presence of recurrent abnormalities. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from nineteen patients and eleven controls were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found a low frequency of CD34+ cells (P = 0.0179) and myeloid progenitors (P = 0.025), in the bone marrow of patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome as compared to the controls. A significant reduction in the percentage of granulocytes (P = 0.002) and an increase of monocytes (P < 0.001) were also evident in the bone marrow of patients.

Physiologically, 5-LO expression is induced by calcitriol and/or transforming growth factor-beta. Regulation of 5-LO mRNA involves promoter activation and elongation control within the 3'-portion of the ALOX5 gene. Here we focused on the ALOX5 promoter region. Transcriptional initiation was associated with an increase in histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation in a TSA-inducible manner. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) protein and its derivatives, MLL-AF4 and AF4-MLL, respectively. MLL-AF4 was able to enhance ALOX5 promoter activity by 47-fold, which was further stimulated when either vitamin D receptor and retinoid X receptor or SMAD3/SMAD4 were co-transfected. In addition, we investigated several histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) in combination with gene knockdown experiments (HDAC1-3, MLL). We were able to demonstrate that a combined inhibition of HDAC1-3 induces ALOX5 promoter activity in an MLL-dependent manner. Surprisingly, a constitutive activation of ALOX5 by MLL-AF4 was inhibited by class I HDAC inhibitors, by relieving inhibitory functions deriving from MLL.Conversely, a knockdown of MLL increased the effects mediated by MLL-AF4. Thus, HDACi treatment seems to switch 'inactive MLL' into 'active MLL' and overwrites the dominant functions deriving from MLL-AF4.","['Ahmad, K', 'Katryniok, C', 'Scholz, B', 'Merkens, J', 'Loscher, D', 'Marschalek, R', 'Steinhilber, D']","['Ahmad K', 'Katryniok C', 'Scholz B', 'Merkens J', 'Loscher D', 'Marschalek R', 'Steinhilber D']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry/ZAFES, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry/ZAFES, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/ZAFES, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/ZAFES, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/ZAFES, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/ZAFES, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry/ZAFES, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141117,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,2014/11/18 06:00,2014/11/18 06:01,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/18 06:01 [medline]']","['oncsis201439 [pii]', '10.1038/oncsis.2014.39 [doi]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2014 Nov 17;3:e127. doi: 10.1038/oncsis.2014.39.,,,,PMC4259963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During 1949-1961 the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission conducted surveys that included a query about exposure to the rain that fell a short time after the bombings. This article presents the first report of those data in relation to possible adverse health outcomes. This study looked at Life Span Study subjects who were in either city at the time of bombing and had an estimated direct radiation dose from the bombs (n = 86,609). The mortality data from 1950-2005 and cancer incidence data from 1958-2005 were used. Excess relative risks (ERRs) of subjects who were exposed to rain compared to those who reported no rain exposure were calculated using a Poisson regression model. In Hiroshima 11,661 subjects (20%) reported that they were exposed to rain, while in Nagasaki only 733 subjects (2.6%) reported rain exposure. To avoid outcome dependent biases (i.e., recall of exposure after a health outcome has already occurred), the primary analyses were based on events that occurred during 1962-2005. No significant risks due to rain exposure were observed for death due to all causes, all solid cancer or leukemia in Hiroshima. In Nagasaki there was no significantly elevated rain exposure-associated risks for 1962-2005, however, for 1950-2005 there was a weak association for all-cause mortality (ERR = 0.08; 95% confidence interval 0.00006, 0.17; P = 0.05). For incidence of solid cancer and leukemia, no significantly elevated rain exposure risks were observed in either city. These results failed to show deleterious health effects from rain exposure. While these data represent the most extensive set of systematically collected data on rain exposure of the atomic bomb survivors, they are limited by substantial uncertainties regarding exposures and missing individual data, so cautious interpretation is advised.","['Sakata, Ritsu', 'Grant, Eric J', 'Furukawa, Kyoji', 'Misumi, Munechika', 'Cullings, Harry', 'Ozasa, Kotaro', 'Shore, Roy E']","['Sakata R', 'Grant EJ', 'Furukawa K', 'Misumi M', 'Cullings H', 'Ozasa K', 'Shore RE']","['a Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Radioactive Fallout/*adverse effects', 'Rain/*chemistry', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR13822.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2014 Dec;182(6):599-606. doi: 10.1667/RR13822.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a desperate need for new therapeutics for these patients. Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is the rate limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis. Didox (3,4-Dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid) is a novel RR inhibitor noted to be more potent than hydroxyurea. In this report we detail the activity and toxicity of Didox in preclinical models of AML. RR was present in all AML cell lines and primary patient samples tested. Didox was active against all human and murine AML lines tested with IC50 values in the low micromolar range (mean IC50 37 microM [range 25.89-52.70 microM]). It was active against primary patient samples at concentrations that did not affect normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Didox exposure resulted in DNA damage and p53 induction culminating in apoptosis. In syngeneic, therapy-resistant AML models, single agent Didox treatment resulted in a significant reduction in leukemia burden and a survival benefit. Didox was well tolerated, as marrow from treated animals was morphologically indistinguishable from controls. Didox exposure at levels that impaired leukemia growth did not inhibit normal HSC engraftment. In summary, Didox was well tolerated and effective against preclinical models of AML.","['Cook, Guerry J', 'Caudell, David L', 'Elford, Howard L', 'Pardee, Timothy S']","['Cook GJ', 'Caudell DL', 'Elford HL', 'Pardee TS']","['Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology, Section of Comparative Medicine, Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Molecules for Health, Richmond, Virginia, United States of America.', 'Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America; Wake Forest University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141117,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'L106XFV0RQ (3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0112619 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-24796 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 17;9(11):e112619. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0112619. eCollection 2014.,,,"['K08 CA169809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K08CA169809-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4234372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adjusted 3-year non-relapse mortality of MMUD (44%) was higher as compared with MUD (35%; P=0.004), but similar to UCB recipients (37%; P=0.19), although UCB had lower rates of neutrophil and platelet recovery compared with unrelated donor groups.

The present study evaluated the antioxidant and cytotoxic potential of hydroethanolic extract from the leaves of Jacaranda decurrens subsp. symmetrifoliolata. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Phenolic compounds, flavonoids and saponins were evaluated in an ethanol:water (80:20, v/v) extract from the leaves of Jacaranda decurrens subsp. symmetrifoliolata (E-Jds). The antioxidant activity of E-Jds was investigated by assessing the following: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity; protection against 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced hemolysis of erythrocytes; in vitro and in vivo malondialdehyde dosage; and the ability to activate antioxidant enzymes. K562 leukemia cells were used for the cytotoxic evaluation of E-Jds and for the assessment of the cell death profile through flow cytometry. KEY RESULTS: Phenolic and flavonoid compounds were quantified as 14.38% and 2.15%, respectively, of E-Jds. These phenolic and flavonoid compounds proved to be able to scavenge DPPH free radicals with an IC50 of 9.3 +/- 3.3 microg/mL, to protect up to 50% of erythrocytes against AAPH-induced hemolysis and to reduce in vitro and in vivo malondialdehyde levels up to 84% and 22%, respectively. E-Jds also increased glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity, with a concomitant decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxic activity on K562 erythroleukemia cells with cell death occurring via both late apoptosis and necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: E-Jds exhibits in vitro and in vivo antioxidant potential, which may be the mechanism mediating the metabolic activities reported in folk medicine. Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity identified in this study contributes with the knowledge of antiproliferative activities that have been described in the literature for the genus Jacaranda.","['Casagrande, Junior Cesar', 'Macorini, Luis Fernando Benitez', 'Antunes, Katia Avila', 'Santos, Uilson Pereira Dos', 'Campos, Jaqueline Ferreira', 'Dias-Junior, Nelson Miguel', 'Sangalli, Andreia', 'Lima Cardoso, Claudia Andrea', 'do Carmo Vieira, Maria', 'Rabelo, Luiza Antas', 'Paredes-Gamero, Edgar Julian', 'Dos Santos, Edson Lucas', 'de Picoli Souza, Kely']","['Casagrande JC', 'Macorini LF', 'Antunes KA', 'Santos UP', 'Campos JF', 'Dias-Junior NM', 'Sangalli A', 'Lima Cardoso CA', 'do Carmo Vieira M', 'Rabelo LA', 'Paredes-Gamero EJ', 'Dos Santos EL', 'de Picoli Souza K']","['Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'State University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141117,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Picrates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'DFD3H4VGDH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Biphenyl Compounds/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Phenols/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Picrates/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Plant Leaves/*chemistry', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0112748 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-32404 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 17;9(11):e112748. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0112748. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4234508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, transplantation teams must have a pre-established policy regarding preventive measures in high-risk patients, strict daily control of weight and fluid balance during HCT, homogeneous diagnostic criteria, appropriate complementary studies for a correct differential diagnosis and measures to prevent and manage hepatorenal syndrome; in addition they must also be ready to start early treatment with defibrotide in patients with a possible severe SOS.

RESULTS: Paternal smoke in the conception period was associated with AnLL (OR for >/= 11 cigarettes/day = 1.79, 95% CI 1.01-3.15; P trend 0.05). An apparent effect modification by maternal age was identified: only children of mothers aged below 30 presented increased risks. We found weak statistical evidence of an association of AnLL with maternal exposure to ETS (OR for exposure>3 hours/day = 1.85, 95%CI 0.97-3.52; P trend 0.07). No association was observed between AnLL and either maternal smoking during pregnancy or child exposure to ETS. CONCLUSIONS: This study is consistent with the hypothesis that paternal smoke is associated with AnLL. We observed statistical evidence of an association between maternal exposure to ETS and AnLL, but believe bias might have inflated our estimates.","['Mattioli, Stefano', 'Farioli, Andrea', 'Legittimo, Patrizia', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Benvenuti, Alessandra', 'Ranucci, Alessandra', 'Salvan, Alberto', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Magnani, Corrado']","['Mattioli S', 'Farioli A', 'Legittimo P', 'Miligi L', 'Benvenuti A', 'Ranucci A', 'Salvan A', 'Rondelli R', 'Magnani C']","['Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Unit of Occupational Medicine, S.Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital, Bologna, Italy; Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, ISPO Cancer Prevention and Research Institute, Florence, Italy.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, ISPO Cancer Prevention and Research Institute, Florence, Italy.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, ISPO Cancer Prevention and Research Institute, Florence, Italy.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit - Department of Translational Medicine, CPO Piemonte and University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Currently retired, IASI-CNR, Rome, Italy.', 'Paediatric Oncology-Haematology ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit - Department of Translational Medicine, CPO Piemonte and University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141117,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111028 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-05848 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 17;9(11):e111028. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111028. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4234298,,,,,,,,,['SETIL Study Group'],,"['Maurizio A', 'Giorgio A', 'Gabriella B', 'Pierfranco B', 'Luigi B', 'Francesco B', 'Vittorio B', 'Santina C', 'Veronica C', 'Egidio C', 'Manuela C', 'Marina C', 'Francesco F', 'Lorenzo G', 'Claudia G', 'Alessandra G', 'Erni G', 'Riccardo H', 'Susanna L', 'Franco L', 'Lidia LL', 'Ursula K', 'Giuseppe M', 'Pia M', 'Franco MD', 'Daniele M', 'Paola M', 'Paola M', 'Cristina N', 'Franco P', 'Pubblica S', 'Alessandro P', 'Vincenzo P', 'Alessandro P', 'Giuseppe S', 'Gino S', 'Serena R', 'Carmelo R', 'Roberto T', 'Valeria TM', 'Maria VR']","['Maurizio, Arico', 'Giorgio, Assennato', 'Gabriella, Bernini', 'Pierfranco, Biddau', 'Luigi, Bisanti', 'Francesco, Bochicchio', 'Vittorio, Bocchini', 'Santina, Cannizzaro', 'Veronica, Casotto', 'Egidio, Celentano', 'Manuela, Chiavarini', 'Marina, Cuttini', 'Francesco, Forastiere', 'Lorenzo, Gafa', 'Claudia, Galassi', 'Alessandra, Greco', 'Erni, Guarino', 'Riccardo, Haupt', 'Susanna, Lagorio', 'Franco, Locatelli', 'Lidia, Luzzatto Lia', 'Ursula, Kirchmayer', 'Giuseppe, Masera', 'Pia, Massaglia', 'Franco, Merlo Domenico', 'Daniele, Monetti', 'Paola, Mosciatti', 'Paola, Michelozzi', 'Cristina, Nuccetelli', 'Franco, Pannelli', 'Pubblica, Sanita', 'Alessandro, Polichetti', 'Vincenzo, Poggi', 'Alessandro, Pulsoni', 'Giuseppe, Sampietro', 'Gino, Schiliro', 'Serena, Risica', 'Carmelo, Rizzari', 'Roberto, Targhetta', 'Valeria, Torregrossa Maria', 'Maria, Valenti Rosaria']",,,,,

It is not well understood how the cell of origin, accompanying mutations, extracellular signals or structural differences in a mutated gene determine the phenotypic identity of leukemias. We dissected the functional aspects of different protein regions of the MN1 oncogene and their effect on the leukemic phenotype, building on the ability of MN1 to induce leukemia without accompanying mutations. We found that the most C-terminal region of MN1 was required to block myeloid differentiation at an early stage, and deletion of an extended C-terminal region resulted in loss of myeloid identity and cell differentiation along the T-cell lineage in vivo. Megakaryocytic/erythroid lineage differentiation was blocked by the N-terminal region. In addition, the N-terminus was required for proliferation and leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo through upregulation of HoxA9, HoxA10 and Meis2. Our results provide evidence that a single oncogene can modulate cellular identity of leukemic cells based on its active gene regions. It is therefore likely that different mutations in the same oncogene may impact cell fate decisions and phenotypic appearance of malignant diseases.","['Lai, Courteney K', 'Moon, Yeonsook', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Starzcynowski, Daniel T', 'Argiropoulos, Bob', 'Yung, Eric', 'Beer, Philip', 'Schwarzer, Adrian', 'Sharma, Amit', 'Park, Gyeongsin', 'Leung, Malina', 'Lin, Grace', 'Vollett, Sarah', 'Fung, Stephen', 'Eaves, Connie J', 'Karsan, Aly', 'Weng, Andrew P', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Lai CK', 'Moon Y', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Starzcynowski DT', 'Argiropoulos B', 'Yung E', 'Beer P', 'Schwarzer A', 'Sharma A', 'Park G', 'Leung M', 'Lin G', 'Vollett S', 'Fung S', 'Eaves CJ', 'Karsan A', 'Weng AP', 'Humphries RK', 'Heuser M']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical School of Inha University, Incheon, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany; Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hospital Pathology, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141117,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MN1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Megakaryocyte-Erythroid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Phenotype', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0112671 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-26381 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 17;9(11):e112671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0112671. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4234417,,,,,['GEO/GSE46990'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell adaptation in long-term culture of HL60 leukemic cells in the presence of chemotherapy leads to induction and maintenance of the ABC transporters expression, preventing further accumulation of drugs. However, we found that decreased accumulation of drugs and fluorescent dyes also contributed by a reduced uptake by the resistant cells. Confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry revealed that fluid-phase endocytosis was diminished in drug-resistant cells compared to drug-sensitive cells. Drug uptake was increased by insulin co-treatment when cells were grown in methylcellulose and monitored under the microscope, but not when cultured in suspension. We propose that multi-drug resistance is not only solely achieved by enhanced efflux capacity but also by supressed intake of the drug, offering an alternative target to overcome drug resistance or potentiate chemotherapy.","['Pisco, Angela Oliveira', 'Jackson, Dean Andrew', 'Huang, Sui']","['Pisco AO', 'Jackson DA', 'Huang S']","['Institute for Systems Biology , Seattle, WA , USA ; Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester , Manchester , UK.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester , Manchester , UK.', 'Institute for Systems Biology , Seattle, WA , USA ; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary , Calgary, AB , Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141031,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2014/11/18 06:00,2014/11/18 06:01,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00306 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 Oct 31;4:306. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00306. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['ABC transporters dependent drug resistance', 'acute myeloid leukemia model', 'cellular responses to anticancer drugs', 'endocytosis-related multi-drug resistance', 'novel mechanism of multi-drug resistance']",['R21 CA123284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4215691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Statins, cholesterol lowering drugs, can induce apoptosis, but also negatively interfere with CD-20 and rituximab-mediated activity. Our goal is to identify the alternative targets that could reduce cholesterol levels but do not interfere with CD-20 in chemo immunotherapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: MEC-2 cells, a CLL cell line, and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CLL patients were treated with cholesterol lowering agents, and analyzed the effect of these agents on cholesterol levels, CD-20 expression and distribution, and cell viability in the presence or absence of fludarabine, rituximab or their combinations. RESULTS: We found that MEC-2 cells treated with cholesterol lowering agents (BIBB-515, YM-53601 or TAK-475) reduced 20% of total cellular cholesterol levels, but also significantly promoted CD-20 surface expression. Furthermore, treatment of cells with fludarabine, rituximab or their combinations in the presence of BIBB-515, YM-53601 or TAK-475 enhanced MEC-2 cell chemoimmuno-sensitivity measured by cell viability. More importantly, these cholesterol lowering agents also significantly enhanced chemoimmuno-sensitivity of the PBMCs from CLL patients. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that BIBB-515, YM53601 and TAK-475 render chemoimmuno-therapy resistant MEC-2 cells sensitive to chemoimmuno-therapy and enhance CLL cell chemoimmuno-sensitivity without CD-20 epitope presentation or its downstream signaling.

The hallmark of FL is t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation, which juxtaposes anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 to immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) promoter. Reflecting this background, FL cells are immunohistochemically positive for BCL2 as well as GC B cell markers CD10 and BCL6. It is known that low grade B-cell lymphomas, including FL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma, are sometimes associated with marginal zone differentiation or plasmacytic differentiation. The marginal zone differentiation obscures the morphological differences among these, providing diagnostic challenges for histopathologists. In this paper, we present a case of FL, originally mimicking marginal zone lymphoma in the axillary lymph node. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy showed paratrabecular infiltration of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of the bone marrow biopsy together with histopathology and flow cytometry of the axillary lymph node led to a final diagnosis of FL with marginal zone differentiation in the axillary lymph node and its bone marrow infiltration. Our case illustrates and reconfirms the importance of clinicopathological correlation which leads to a correct diagnosis.","['Matsuda, Ikuo', 'Shimizu, Yoshifumi', 'Okamoto, Takahiro', 'Hirota, Seiichi']","['Matsuda I', 'Shimizu Y', 'Okamoto T', 'Hirota S']","['Department of Surgical Pathology, Hyogo College of Medicine Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Takarazuka Municipal Hospital Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Takarazuka Municipal Hospital Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Surgical Pathology, Hyogo College of Medicine Hyogo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140915,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/chemistry/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/chemistry/*pathology', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/07/07 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Sep 15;7(10):7076-81. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['Follicular lymphoma', 'flow cytometry', 'marginal zone differentiation']",,PMC4230096,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the related research is rare of Tim-3 in non-solid tumor, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we investigated the expression characteristics of Tim-3 on the peripheral blood T cells of newly diagnosed AML patients and its clinical significance. Peripheral blood was obtained from 36 patients with newly diagnosed AML before intervention, with peripheral blood from 20 cases of healthy volunteers collected as normal control. Expression levels of Tim-3 on the peripheral blood T cells were assayed with flow cytometry. We found that Tim-3 expression on the peripheral blood CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in newly diagnosed AML patients were significantly increased compared with that of normal control. CD4+ T cells/CD8+ T cell ratio (CD4/CD8) of peripheral blood in AML patients was significantly correlated with NCCN high risk group. The higher expression level of Tim-3 on CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of AML patients had significant correlation with FLT3-ITD mutation, the higher expression level of Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells in AML patients was significantly correlated with NCCN high risk group. To conclude, our results support the concept that Tim-3 is highly expressed on the peripheral blood T cells of AML patients, and Tim-3 expression significantly correlates with clinicopathological prognostic stratification in AMLTim-3, T cell, acute myeloid leukemia, tumor immune escape, clinicopathological prognostic stratification.","['Li, Caixia', 'Chen, Xiaochen', 'Yu, Xiao', 'Zhu, Yibei', 'Ma, Chao', 'Xia, Rui', 'Ma, Jinfeng', 'Gu, Caihong', 'Ye, Lu', 'Wu, Depei']","['Li C', 'Chen X', 'Yu X', 'Zhu Y', 'Ma C', 'Xia R', 'Ma J', 'Gu C', 'Ye L', 'Wu D']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University Suzhou, P.R.

The entire coding region of CEBPA gene was amplified by PCR and then sequenced in samples from 233 non-M3 AML patients. Fifty mutations were identified in 37 (15.8%) patients with eleven (4.7%) double mutated CEBPA (dmCEBPA) and twenty-six (11.1%) single mutated CEBPA (smCEBPA). dmCEBPA was exclusively observed in M1 and M2 subtypes of FAB classification (P = 0.008), whereas smCEBPA occurred in almost all subtypes (P = 0.401). Patients with dmCEBPA had significantly younger age and higher WBC counts than those with wtCEBPA (P = 0.016 and 0.043, respectively). Both dmCEBPA and smCEBPA were mainly present in cytogenetically normal patients. Patients with dmCEBPA achieved higher rate of complete (CR) than wtCEBPA patients (88% vs. 51%, P = 0.037), whereas smCEBPA and wtCEBPA groups are similar (47% vs. 51%, P = 0.810). Patients with dmCEBPA had a superior overall survival (OS) compared with patients with wtCEBPA (P = 0.033), whereas patients with smCEBPA had a similar OS as patients with wtCEBPA (P = 0.976). dmCEBPA but not smCEBPA was also associated with favorable outcome in patients with wild-type NPM1 and FLT3-ITD (NPM1(wt)FLT3-ITD(wt) ). Our data confirm that dmCEBPA but not smCEBPA is prognostically favorable in NPM1(wt)FLT3-ITD(wt) AML, and suggest that the entity AML with mutated CEBPA should be definitely designated as AML with dmCEBPA in WHO classification and smCEBPA should be excluded from the favorable risk of molecular abnormalities.","['Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Yang, Jing', 'Yao, Dong-Ming', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Tang, Chun-Yan', 'Xiao, Gao-Fei', 'Yang, Lei', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Hu, Jia-Bo', 'Qian, Wei', 'Qian, Jun']","['Wen XM', 'Lin J', 'Yang J', 'Yao DM', 'Deng ZQ', 'Tang CY', 'Xiao GF', 'Yang L', 'Ma JC', 'Hu JB', 'Qian W', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine, Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212013, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Jiangsu 212002, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140915,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians/genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'China/epidemiology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/ethnology/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Sep 15;7(10):6832-40. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['CEBPA', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'mutation', 'prognosis']",,PMC4230151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A favorable overall prognosis over other subtypes of AML has been reported for APL patients but still about 15% patients relapse. METHODS: This study evaluated the presence of Famus like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) and nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) gene mutations in a cohort of 40 APL patients. Bone marrow/peripheral blood samples from patients at the time of diagnosis and follow-up were processed for immunophenotyping, cytogenetic markers and isolation of DNA and RNA. Samples were screened for the presence of mutations in FLT3 and NPM1 genes using polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing. RESULTS: Frequency of FLT3/internal tandem duplication and FLT3/tyrosine kinase domain was found to be 25% and 7% respectively. We observed a high frequency of NPM1 mutation (45%) in the present population of APL patients.","['Swaminathan, Suchitra', 'Garg, Swati', 'Madkaikar, Manisha', 'Gupta, Maya', 'Jijina, Farah', 'Ghosh, Kanjaksha']","['Swaminathan S', 'Garg S', 'Madkaikar M', 'Gupta M', 'Jijina F', 'Ghosh K']","['Department of Pediatric Immunology and Leukocyte Biology, National Institute of Immunohaematology, Indian Council of Medical Research, K.E.M.

Early relapse within 6-9 months of diagnosis is common. Approximately 75% of infants have MLL-rearranged (MLL-R) ALL with event free survival (EFS) ranging from 20% to 30%. Children's Oncology Group (COG) P9407 used shortened (46 weeks), intensified therapy to address early relapse and poor EFS. PROCEDURE: P9407 therapy was modified three times for induction toxicity resulting in three cohorts of therapy. One hundred forty-seven infants were enrolled in the third cohort. RESULTS: We report an overall 5-year EFS and OS of 42.3 +/- 6% and 52.9 +/- 6.5% respectively. Poor prognostic factors included age </=90 days at diagnosis, MLL-R ALL and white cell count >/=50,000/mul. For infants </=90 days of age, the 5-year EFS was 15.5 +/- 10.1% and 48.5 +/- 6.7% for those >90 days (P < 0.0001). Among infants >90 days of age, 5-year EFS rates were 43.8 +/- 8% for MLL-R versus 69.1 +/- 13.6% for MLL-germline ALL (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Age </=90 days at diagnosis was the most important prognostic factor. Despite shortened therapy with early intensification, EFS remained less than 50% overall in MLL-R ALL.","['Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Jones, Tamekia L', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Chen, I-Ming', 'Behm, Fred G', 'Pullen, Jeanette', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Felix, Carolyn A', 'Robinson, Blaine', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Salzer, Wanda L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L', 'Camitta, Bruce M']","['Dreyer ZE', 'Hilden JM', 'Jones TL', 'Devidas M', 'Winick NJ', 'Willman CL', 'Harvey RC', 'Chen IM', 'Behm FG', 'Pullen J', 'Wood BL', 'Carroll AJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Felix CA', 'Robinson B', 'Reaman GH', 'Salzer WL', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL', 'Camitta BM']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141114,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25322 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Mar;62(3):419-26. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25322.

Unfortunately, the leukemia eventually becomes resistant imatinib as a result of emergence of cells expressing drug insensitive BCR-ABL mutant proteins. This has motivated the development of several next-generation ATP-competitive drugs. This chapter describes the discovery and development of a complementary strategy involving inhibiting BCR-ABL by targeting an allosteric binding site. Compounds that bind to the myristate-binding pocket of BCR-ABL are able to induce formation of an ""inactive"" state and are able to overcome resistance mutations located in the ATP-binding pocket including the recalcitrant T315I ""gatekeeper"" mutation. Myristate-pocket inhibitors are also able to function synergistically with ATP-competitive inhibitors in cellular and murine models of CML and this dual inhibitory strategy is currently being investigated in the clinic.","['Gray, Nathanael S', 'Fabbro, Doriano']","['Gray NS', 'Fabbro D']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston MA, USA.

PKC isoforms are ubiquitously expressed in tissues which makes it difficult to define roles for individual isoforms, with complexity compounded by the finding that PKC isoforms can co-operate with or antagonize other PKC family members. A number of studies suggest the involvement of PKC family members in regulating leukaemic cell survival and proliferation. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most common leukaemia in the Western world, exhibits dysregulated expression of PKC isoforms, with recent reports indicating that PKCbeta and delta play a critical role in B-cell development, due to their ability to link the B-cell receptor (BCR) with downstream signalling pathways. Given the prognostic significance of the BCR in CLL, inhibition of these BCR/PKC-mediated signalling pathways is of therapeutic relevance. The present review discusses the emerging role of PKC isoforms in the pathophysiology of CLL and assesses approaches that have been undertaken to modulate PKC activity.","['Tarafdar, Anuradha', 'Michie, Alison M']","['Tarafdar A', 'Michie AM']","[""*Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, 21 Shelley Road, Glasgow G12 02D, U.K."", ""*Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, 21 Shelley Road, Glasgow G12 02D, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism']",2014/11/18 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/18 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['BST20140255 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20140255 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2014 Dec;42(6):1556-62. doi: 10.1042/BST20140255.,,,['MR/K014854/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC4613511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV infects cattle worldwide, imposing a severe economic impact on the dairy cattle industry. However, there are no comprehensive studies on the distribution of BLV in the Philippines, and the genetic characteristics of Philippine BLV strains are unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect BLV infections in the Philippines and determined their genetic variability. Blood samples were obtained from 1116 cattle from different farms on five Philippine islands, and BLV provirus was detected by BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2 and nested PCR targeting BLV long terminal repeats. Out of 1116 samples, 108 (9.7 %) and 54 (4.8 %) were positive for BLV provirus, as determined by BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2 and nested PCR, respectively. Of the five islands, Luzon Island showed the highest prevalence of BLV infection (23.1 %). Partial env gp51 genes from 43 samples, which were positive for BLV provirus by both methods, were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on a 423-bp fragment of the env gene revealed that Philippine BLV strains clustered into either genotype 1 or genotype 6. Substitutions were mainly found in antigenic determinants, such as the CD4(+) T-cell epitope, the CD8(+) T-cell epitope, the second neutralizing domain, B and E epitopes, and these substitutions varied according to genotype. This study provides comprehensive information regarding BLV infection levels in the Philippines and documents the presence of two BLV genotypes, genotypes 1 and 6, in this population.","['Polat, Meripet', 'Ohno, Ayumu', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Kim, Jiyun', 'Kikuya, Mari', 'Matsumoto, Yuki', 'Mingala, Claro Niegos', 'Onuma, Misao', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Polat M', 'Ohno A', 'Takeshima SN', 'Kim J', 'Kikuya M', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Mingala CN', 'Onuma M', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, 351-0198, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141116,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Philippines/epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2014/11/17 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/11/17 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00705-014-2280-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 2015 Jan;160(1):285-96. doi: 10.1007/s00705-014-2280-3.

Changes in cell function may affect the basal electrical surface properties of cell membranes. These changes can be detected using electrokinetic measurements. Surface charge densities of Molt-4 cells were measured as a function of pH. A four-component equilibrium model was used to describe the interaction between the ions in solution and on cell membrane surfaces. Agreement was found between the experimental and theoretical charge variation curves of the leukemia cells at pH 2.5-9. Lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring levels of 8-iso-prostaglandine F2alpha [isoprostanes]. Acid and base functional group concentrations and average association constants with hydroxyl ions were smaller in cisplatin- or dinuclear platinum(II) complex-treated leukemia cell membranes compared to those in untreated cancer cells, and the average association constants with hydrogen ions were higher. Levels of lipid peroxidation products in cisplatin- or dinuclear platinum(II) complex-treated leukemia cell were higher than those found in untreated cancer cells.","['Dobrzynska, Izabela', 'Skrzydlewska, Elzbieta', 'Figaszewski, Zbigniew A']","['Dobrzynska I', 'Skrzydlewska E', 'Figaszewski ZA']","['Institute of Chemistry, University in Bialystok, Al.

Recent studies have shown that expression of the IDH mutant enzymes results in high levels of 2HG and a block in cellular differentiation that can be reversed with IDH mutant-specific small-molecule inhibitors. To further understand the role of IDH mutations in cancer, we conducted mechanistic studies in the TF-1 IDH2 R140Q erythroleukemia model system and found that IDH2 mutant expression caused both histone and genomic DNA methylation changes that can be reversed when IDH2 mutant activity is inhibited. Specifically, histone hypermethylation is rapidly reversed within days, whereas reversal of DNA hypermethylation proceeds in a progressive manner over the course of weeks. We identified several gene signatures implicated in tumorigenesis of leukemia and lymphoma, indicating a selective modulation of relevant cancer genes by IDH mutations. As methylation of DNA and histones is closely linked to mRNA expression and differentiation, these results indicate that IDH2 mutant inhibition may function as a cancer therapy via histone and DNA demethylation at genes involved in differentiation and tumorigenesis.","['Kernytsky, Andrew', 'Wang, Fang', 'Hansen, Erica', 'Schalm, Stefanie', 'Straley, Kimberly', 'Gliser, Camelia', 'Yang, Hua', 'Travins, Jeremy', 'Murray, Stuart', 'Dorsch, Marion', 'Agresta, Sam', 'Schenkein, David P', 'Biller, Scott A', 'Su, Shinsan M', 'Liu, Wei', 'Yen, Katharine E']","['Kernytsky A', 'Wang F', 'Hansen E', 'Schalm S', 'Straley K', 'Gliser C', 'Yang H', 'Travins J', 'Murray S', 'Dorsch M', 'Agresta S', 'Schenkein DP', 'Biller SA', 'Su SM', 'Liu W', 'Yen KE']","['Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AGI-6780)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Transcriptome/*drug effects']",2014/11/16 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/11/16 06:00'],"['2014/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35354-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-10-533604 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 8;125(2):296-303. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-10-533604.

We expressed the R195H mutant of Drosophila Idh (CG7176), which is equivalent to the human cancer-associated IDH1-R132H mutant, in fly tissues using the UAS-Gal4 binary expression system. Idh-R195H caused a >25-fold elevation of D-2HG when expressed ubiquitously in flies. Expression of mutant Idh in larval blood cells (hemocytes) resulted in higher numbers of circulating blood cells. Mutant Idh expression in fly neurons resulted in neurologic and wing-expansion defects, and these phenotypes were rescued by genetic modulation of superoxide dismutase 2, p53, and apoptotic caspase cascade mediators. Idh-R163Q, which is homologous to the common leukemia-associated IDH2-R140Q mutant, resulted in moderately elevated D-2HG and milder phenotypes. We identified the fly homolog of D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid dehydrogenase (CG3835), which metabolizes D-2HG, and showed that coexpression of this enzyme with mutant Idh abolishes mutant Idh-associated phenotypes. These results provide a flexible model system to interrogate a cancer-related genetic and metabolic pathway and offer insights into the impact of IDH mutation and D-2HG on metazoan tissues.","['Reitman, Zachary J', 'Sinenko, Sergey A', 'Spana, Eric P', 'Yan, Hai']","['Reitman ZJ', 'Sinenko SA', 'Spana EP', 'Yan H']","['The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center, Department of Pathology, and.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC; and.', 'Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center, Department of Pathology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glutarates)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics', 'Glutarates/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2014/11/16 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/11/16 06:00'],"['2014/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35358-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-577940 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 8;125(2):336-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-577940.

We found that mutations in WT1, IDH2, and CEBPA were strongly linked to DNA hypermethylation in AML using a novel integrative analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data based on Boolean implications, if-then rules that identify all individual CpG sites that are hypermethylated in the presence of a mutation. Introduction of mutant WT1 (WT1mut) into wild-type AML cells induced DNA hypermethylation, confirming mutant WT1 to be causally associated with DNA hypermethylation. Methylated genes in WT1mut primary patient samples were highly enriched for polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) targets, implicating PRC2 dysregulation in WT1mut leukemogenesis. We found that PRC2 target genes were aberrantly repressed in WT1mut AML, and that expression of mutant WT1 in CD34(+) cord blood cells induced myeloid differentiation block. Treatment of WT1mut AML cells with short hairpin RNA or pharmacologic PRC2/enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitors promoted myeloid differentiation, suggesting EZH2 inhibitors may be active in this AML subtype. Our results highlight a strong association between mutant WT1 and DNA hypermethylation in AML and demonstrate that Boolean implications can be used to decipher mutation-specific methylation patterns that may lead to therapeutic insights.","['Sinha, Subarna', 'Thomas, Daniel', 'Yu, Linda', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Jung, Namyoung', 'Corces-Zimmerman, M Ryan', 'Chan, Steven M', 'Reinisch, Andreas', 'Feinberg, Andrew P', 'Dill, David L', 'Majeti, Ravindra']","['Sinha S', 'Thomas D', 'Yu L', 'Gentles AJ', 'Jung N', 'Corces-Zimmerman MR', 'Chan SM', 'Reinisch A', 'Feinberg AP', 'Dill DL', 'Majeti R']","['Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA; and.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Institute for Basic Biomedical Science, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'Center for Epigenetics, Institute for Basic Biomedical Science, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2014/11/16 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/11/16 06:00'],"['2014/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35356-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-566018 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 8;125(2):316-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-566018.

The specific mechanism of action is still undefined, but includes modulation of the microenvironment. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, nurse-like cells differentiate from CD14(+) mononuclear cells and protect chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from apoptosis. Nurse-like cells resemble M2 macrophages with potent immunosuppressive functions. Here, we examined the effect of lenalidomide on the monocyte/macrophage population in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. We found that lenalidomide induces high actin polymerization on CD14(+) monocytes through activation of small GTPases, RhoA, Rac1 and Rap1 that correlated with increased adhesion and impaired monocyte migration in response to CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL12. We observed that lenalidomide increases the number of nurse-like cells that lost the ability to nurture chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, acquired properties of phagocytosis and promoted T-cell proliferation. Gene expression signature, induced by lenalidomide in nurse-like cells, indicated a reduction of pivotal pro-survival signals for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, such as CCL2, IGF1, CXCL12, HGF1, and supported a modulation towards M1 phenotype with high IL2 and low IL10, IL8 and CD163.

Although predominantly present in hepatocytes, CYP2E1 has also been found in hematopoietic stem cells and subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia with unknown clinical significance except for the metabolism of anti-fungal drugs. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel role of CYP2E1 inducing megakaryocyte development in human hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia bipotent K562 cells. CYP2E1 was induced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate in dose-dependent manner in K562 cells as well as in hematopoietic stem cells by thrombopoietin, and ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate (IDB), respectively. Overexpression of CYP2E1 was positively correlated with megakaryocytes and in megakaryocyte maturation. In addition, plasmid-driven expression of CYP2E1 in K562 cells led to morphological transformation of leukemic blasts to pro- and mature megakaryocytes. In contrast, knockout of CYP2E1 by specific interfering RNA diverted these cells to erythroid differentiation. Finally, treatment of K562 cells by a free radical scavenger, N-acetyl L-lysine significantly inhibited CYP2E1 and megakaryocyte differentiation. In summary, our data demonstrated that activation of CYP2E1 and reactive oxygen species signaling promotes megakaryocyte development.","['Tang, Yan', 'Zhang, Guojuan', 'Baird, Maureen', 'Racke, Frederick', 'Zhao, Weiqiang']","['Tang Y', 'Zhang G', 'Baird M', 'Racke F', 'Zhao W']","['Pathology Core Facility, Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, U.S.A.', 'Pathology Core Facility, Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, U.S.A.', 'Pathology Core Facility, Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, U.S.A.', 'Nichols Institute, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, U.S.A.', 'Pathology Core Facility, Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, U.S.A. weiqiang.zhao@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (U 0126)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)']",IM,"['Butadienes/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Thrombopoiesis/genetics']",2014/11/16 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/16 06:00'],"['2014/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['28/6/1077 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2014 Nov-Dec;28(6):1077-84.,['NOTNLM'],"['CYP2E1', 'ROS', 'development', 'megakaryocyte']",,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess the pharmacogenomic effects of Ara-C metabolic pathway in patients with AML. METHODS: The genotypes of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of DCK, CDA and SLC29A1from 100 AML patients treated with Ara-C were examined. All the SNPs were screened with ligase detection reaction assay. The transcription analysis of genes was examined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. The association between clinical outcome and gene variants was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Genotypes of rs9394992 and rs324148 for SLC29A1 in remission patients were significantly different from those in relapsed ones. Post-induction overall survival (OS) significantly decreased in patients with the CC genotype of rs324148 compared with CT and TT genotypes (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.997 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71-5.27]). As compared with CT and TT genotype, patients with the CC genotype of rs9394992 had longer survival time (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.075-0.81]; HR = 0.43 [95% CI: 0.24-0.78]) and longer disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 0.52 [95% CI: 0.29-0.93]; HR = 0.15 [95% CI: 0.05-0.47]) as well As compared with CT and TT genotype, patients with the CC genotype of rs324148 had shorter DFS (HR = 3.18 [95% CI: 1.76-5.76]). Additionally, patients with adverse karyotypes had shorter DFS (HR = 0.17 [95% CI: 0.05-0.54]) and OS (HR = 0.18 [95% CI: 0.05-0.68]). CONCLUSIONS: AML patients with low activity of SLC29A1 genotype have shorter DFS and OS in Ara-C based therapy. Genotypes of rs9394992 and rs324148 may be independent prognostic predictors for the survival of AML patients.","['Wan, Haixia', 'Zhu, Jianyi', 'Chen, Fangyuan', 'Xiao, Fei', 'Huang, Honghui', 'Han, Xiaofeng', 'Zhong, Lu', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Xu, Lan', 'Ni, Beiwen', 'Zhong, Jihua']","['Wan H', 'Zhu J', 'Chen F', 'Xiao F', 'Huang H', 'Han X', 'Zhong L', 'Zhong H', 'Xu L', 'Ni B', 'Zhong J']","['Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. aurorawan@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. linzhujianyi@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. chenfangyuan62@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. xiaofei_78@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. honghui_huang@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. hanxf_2007@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. lucyzg25@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. zhh_lj@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. x_lan2008@sohu.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. nibw1979@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. jhzhong28@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141115,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/16 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/16 06:00'],"['2014/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-014-0090-9 [doi]', 's13046-014-0090-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Nov 15;33:90. doi: 10.1186/s13046-014-0090-9.,,,,PMC4234887,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only a few cases have been reported, and data for these patients are scarce. To describe characteristics and outcome of CD3-CD4+ L-HES patients, we conducted a national multicentric retrospective study in the French Eosinophil Network. All patients who met the recent criteria of hypereosinophilia (HE) or HES and who had a persistent CD3-CD4+ T-cell subset on blood T-cell phenotyping were included. Clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively collected by chart review. CD3-CD4+ L-HES was diagnosed in 21 patients (13 females, median age 42 years [range, 5-75 yr]). Half (48%) had a history of atopic manifestations. Clinical manifestations were dermatologic (81%), superficial adenopathy (62%), rheumatologic (29%), gastrointestinal (24%), pulmonary (19%), neurologic (10%), and cardiovascular (5%). The median absolute CD3-CD4+ T-cell count was 0.35 G/L (range, 0.01-28.3), with a clonal TCRgammadelta rearrangement in 76% of patients. The mean follow-up duration after HES diagnosis was 6.9 +/- 5.1 years. All patients treated with oral corticosteroids (CS) (n = 18) obtained remission, but 16 required CS-sparing treatments. One patient had a T-cell lymphoma 8 years after diagnosis, and 3 deaths occurred during follow-up.In conclusion, clinical manifestations related to CD3-CD4+ T cell-associated L-HES are not limited to skin, and can involve all tissue or organs affected in other types of HE. Contrary to FIP1L1-PDGFRA chronic eosinophilic leukemia patients, CS are always effective in these patients, but CS-sparing treatments are frequently needed. The occurrence of T-cell lymphoma, although rare in our cohort, remains a major concern during follow-up.","['Lefevre, Guillaume', 'Copin, Marie-Christine', 'Staumont-Salle, Delphine', 'Avenel-Audran, Martine', 'Aubert, Helene', 'Taieb, Alain', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Maisonneuve, Herve', 'Ghomari, Kamel', 'Ackerman, Felix', 'Legrand, Fanny', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Launay, David', 'Terriou, Louis', 'Leclech, Christian', 'Khouatra, Chahera', 'Morati-Hafsaoui, Chafika', 'Labalette, Myriam', 'Borie, Raphael', 'Cotton, Francois', 'Gouellec, Noemie Le', 'Morschhauser, Franck', 'Trauet, Jacques', 'Roche-Lestienne, Catherine', 'Capron, Monique', 'Hatron, Pierre-Yves', 'Prin, Lionel', 'Kahn, Jean-Emmanuel']","['Lefevre G', 'Copin MC', 'Staumont-Salle D', 'Avenel-Audran M', 'Aubert H', 'Taieb A', 'Salles G', 'Maisonneuve H', 'Ghomari K', 'Ackerman F', 'Legrand F', 'Baruchel A', 'Launay D', 'Terriou L', 'Leclech C', 'Khouatra C', 'Morati-Hafsaoui C', 'Labalette M', 'Borie R', 'Cotton F', 'Gouellec NL', 'Morschhauser F', 'Trauet J', 'Roche-Lestienne C', 'Capron M', 'Hatron PY', 'Prin L', 'Kahn JE']","[""Institut d'Immunologie, Reseau Eosinophile, EA2686 (GL, FL, DL, ML, JT, JEK), Service d'Immunologie Clinique et de Medecine Interne, Centre de Reference Maladies Auto-Immunes Systemiques (GL, DL, LT, NLG, PYH), Institut de Pathologie (MCC), Service de Dermatologie (DSS), Service des Maladies du Sang (FM), Institut de Genetique Medicale, U837 Inserm (CRL), Reseau Eosinophile, U995 Inserm (MC), CHRU de Lille, Universite Lille Nord de France, Lille; Service de Dermatologie (MAA, CL), CHU d'Angers, L'UNAM Universite, Angers; Service de Dermatologie et Dermatologie Pediatrique, Centre de Reference pour les Maladies Rares de la Peau, U1035 (AT), CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux; Service d'Hematologie (GS) and Service de Radiologie, CREATIS, UMR5220 CNRS, U1044 Inserm (FC), Hopital Sud, Service de Pneumologie, Centre de Reference pour les Maladies Pulmonaires Rares (CK), Hospices Civils de Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon I, Lyon; Service d'Onco-Hematologie (HM), Centre Hospitalier de La Roche-Sur-Yon, La Roche-Sur-Yon; Service d'Onco-Hematologie (KG), Centre Hospitalier de Beauvais, Beauvais; Service de Medecine Interne (FA), Hopital Bicetre, APHP, Universite Paris Sud XI, Le Kremlin-Bicetre; Service d'Hematologie et Immunologie Pediatrique (AB), Hopital Robert Debre, APHP, Universite Paris Diderot and Service de Pneumologie A, Centre de Competence Maladies Pulmonaires Rares (RB), Hopital Bichat, APHP, Paris; Service de Medecine Interne (CMH), Centre Hospitalier d'Annecy, Annecy; Service de Medecine Interne, Hopital Foch, Suresne; EA4340, Biomarqueurs en Cancerologie et en Onco-Hematologie, Universite Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (JEK), France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (CD3 Complex)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*CD3 Complex', '*CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/01/27 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000000088 [doi]', '00005792-201410030-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2014 Oct;93(17):255-266. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000000088.,,,,PMC4602413,,,,,,,,,['French Eosinophil Network'],,,,,,,,

The age of clinical presentation ranges from early childhood to late adulthood, with most occurring in adolescence to early adulthood. We review the expanding GATA2-deficient phenotype, molecular genetics of disease and developments in treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: GATA2 mutations have been found in up to 10% of those with congenital neutropenia and/or aplastic anemia. Heterozygous mutations appear to cause haploinsufficiency due to either protein dysfunction or uniallelic reduced transcription. Disease-associated mutations in intronic regulatory elements or variations within the 5' leader exons indicate that regulation of GATA2 is critical. Those with GATA2 mutations are at high risk for myelodysplasia, cytogenetic abnormalities, acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Bone marrow transplantation has been successful for both hematopoietic and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis repair. SUMMARY: GATA2 is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for embryonic and definitive hematopoiesis as well as lymphatic angiogenesis. GATA2 deficiency is caused by a variety of mutations in the GATA2 gene and can have variable presentation, onset and outcome. Patients are susceptible to mycobacterial, viral and fungal infections and can develop myelodysplasia, acute or chronic leukemias, lymphedema and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reverses most of the clinical phenotype with good long-term outcomes.","['Hsu, Amy P', 'McReynolds, Lisa J', 'Holland, Steven M']","['Hsu AP', 'McReynolds LJ', 'Holland SM']","['aLaboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases bPediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol,Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,100936359,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infections/*genetics/therapy', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/09/09 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/ACI.0000000000000126 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol. 2015 Feb;15(1):104-9. doi: 10.1097/ACI.0000000000000126.,,,"['T32 CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 AI999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4342850,['NIHMS659386'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limiting DOT1L inhibitor discovery and ligand optimization have been complex biochemical methods often using radionucleotides and cellular methods requiring prolonged culture. We therefore developed a new suite of assay technologies that allows comparative assessment of chemical tools for DOT1L in a miniaturized format. Coupling these assays with structural information, we developed new insights into DOT1L ligand binding and identified several functionalized probes with increased cellular potency (IC50 values approximately 10 nM) and excellent selectivity for DOT1L. Together these assay technologies define a platform capability for discovery and optimization of small-molecule DOT1L inhibitors.","['Yi, Joanna S', 'Federation, Alexander J', 'Qi, Jun', 'Dhe-Paganon, Sirano', 'Hadler, Michael', 'Xu, Xiang', 'St Pierre, Roodolph', 'Varca, Anthony C', 'Wu, Lei', 'Marineau, Jason J', 'Smith, William B', 'Souza, Amanda', 'Chory, Emma J', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Bradner, James E']","['Yi JS', 'Federation AJ', 'Qi J', 'Dhe-Paganon S', 'Hadler M', 'Xu X', 'St Pierre R', 'Varca AC', 'Wu L', 'Marineau JJ', 'Smith WB', 'Souza A', 'Chory EJ', 'Armstrong SA', 'Bradner JE']","['daggerDepartment of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'double daggerDepartment of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'section signDepartment of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'parallelDepartment of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'perpendicularHuman Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States.', '#Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'oShanghai ChemPartner Co.

These three molecules are important regulators of several steps in the cell cycle, including the activation of various cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDC25s seem to have a role in the development of several human malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and CDC25 inhibition is therefore considered as a possible anticancer strategy. Firstly, upregulation of CDC25A can enhance cell proliferation and the expression seems to be controlled through PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, a pathway possibly mediating chemoresistance in human AML. Loss of CDC25A is also important for the cell cycle arrest caused by differentiation induction of malignant hematopoietic cells. Secondly, high CDC25B expression is associated with resistance against the antiproliferative effect of PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibitors in primary human AML cells, and inhibition of this isoform seems to reduce AML cell line proliferation through effects on NFkappaB and p300. Finally, CDC25C seems important for the phenotype of AML cells at least for a subset of patients. Many of the identified CDC25 inhibitors show cross-reactivity among the three CDC25 isoforms. Thus, by using such cross-reactive inhibitors it may become possible to inhibit several molecular events in the regulation of cell cycle progression and even cytoplasmic signaling, including activation of several CDKs, through the use of a single drug. Such combined strategies will probably be an advantage in human cancer treatment.","['Brenner, Annette K', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Lavecchia, Antonio', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Brenner AK', 'Reikvam H', 'Lavecchia A', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen, 5021, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen, 5021, Norway.', '""Drug Discovery"" Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II, Naples 80131, Italy.', 'Section for Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen, 5021, Norway. oystein.bruserud@helse-bergen.no.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141112,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology', '*Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*cdc25 Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules191118414 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules191118414 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2014 Nov 12;19(11):18414-47. doi: 10.3390/molecules191118414.,,,,PMC6270710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FeLV-T is fusion defective because in its PHQ motif, a gammaretroviral consensus motif in the N terminus of an envelope protein, histidine is replaced with aspartate. Infection by FeLV-T requires FeLIX, a truncated envelope protein encoded by an endogenous FeLV, for transactivation of infectivity and Pit1 for binding FeLIX. Although Pit1 is present in most tissues in cats, the expression of FeLIX is limited to certain cells in lymphoid organs. Therefore, the host cell range of FeLV-T was thought to be restricted to cells expressing FeLIX. However, because FeLIX is a soluble factor and is expressed constitutively in lymphoid organs, we presumed it to be present in blood and evaluated its activities in sera of various mammalian species using a pseudotype assay. We demonstrated that cat serum has FeLIX activity at a functional level, suggesting that FeLIX is present in the blood and that FeLV-T may be able to infect cells expressing Pit1 regardless of the expression of FeLIX in vivo. In addition, FeLIX activities in sera were detected only in domestic cats and not in other feline species tested. To our knowledge, this is the first report to prove that a large amount of truncated envelope protein of endogenous retrovirus is circulating in the blood to facilitate the infection of a pathogenic exogenous retrovirus.","['Sakaguchi, Shoichi', 'Shojima, Takayuki', 'Fukui, Daisuke', 'Miyazawa, Takayuki']","['Sakaguchi S', 'Shojima T', 'Fukui D', 'Miyazawa T']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Department of Cell Biology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virolution, Experimental Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Department of Cell Biology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Asahikawa Municipal Asahiyama Zoological Park and Wildlife Conservation Center, Kuranuma, Higashiasahikawa-cho, Asahikawa, Hokkaido 070-8205, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Department of Cell Biology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virolution, Experimental Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141113,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (FeLIX protein, feline leukemia virus)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Receptors, Virus/*blood/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Virulence']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.071688-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2015 Mar;96(Pt 3):681-687. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.071688-0.

We investigated associations between ALL risk and folate pathway gene polymorphisms, and their modification by maternal folic acid supplements, in a population-based case-control study (2003-2007). METHODS: All Australian pediatric oncology centers provided cases; controls were recruited by national random digit dialing. Data from 392 cases and 535 controls were included. Seven folate pathway gene polymorphisms (MTHFR 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, MTRR 66A>G, MTR 2756 A>G, MTR 5049 C>A, CBS 844 Ins68, and CBS 2199 T>C) were genotyped in children and their parents. Information on prepregnancy maternal folic acid supplement use was collected. ORs were estimated with unconditional logistic regression adjusted for frequency-matched variables and potential confounders. Case-parent trios were also analyzed. RESULTS: There was some evidence of a reduced risk of ALL among children who had, or whose father had, the MTRR 66GG genotype: ORs 0.60 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.91] and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.40-1.03), respectively. The ORs for paternal MTHFR 677CT and TT genotypes were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.02-1.93) and 1.81 (95% CI, 1.06-3.07). ORs varied little by maternal folic acid supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Some folate pathway gene polymorphisms in the child or a parent may influence ALL risk. While biologically plausible, underlying mechanisms for these associations need further elucidation. IMPACT: Folate pathway polymorphisms may be related to risk of childhood ALL, but larger studies are needed for conclusive results.","['Milne, Elizabeth', 'Greenop, Kathryn R', 'Scott, Rodney J', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Attia, John', 'Jamieson, Sarra E', 'Miller, Margaret', 'Bower, Carol', 'Bailey, Helen D', 'Dawson, Somer', 'McCowage, Geoffrey B', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'van Bockxmeer, Frank M', 'Armstrong, Bruce K']","['Milne E', 'Greenop KR', 'Scott RJ', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Attia J', 'Jamieson SE', 'Miller M', 'Bower C', 'Bailey HD', 'Dawson S', 'McCowage GB', 'de Klerk NH', 'van Bockxmeer FM', 'Armstrong BK']","['Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.

However, whether risk for subsequent neoplasms (SNs) also increases is unknown. We report the cumulative incidence of, and risk factors for, SNs after a childhood primary CNS tumor and determine whether treatment that combines radiation therapy (RT) with chemotherapy increases risk for SNs. METHODS: Analyses included 2779 patients with a primary CNS tumor treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1985 and 2012. Cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated for SNs confirmed by pathology report. Cumulative incidence among the 237 five-year medulloblastoma survivors treated with multimodal therapy (RT + chemotherapy) was compared with a historical cohort of 139 five-year survivors treated with RT but no chemotherapy in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. RESULTS: Eighty-one survivors had 97 SNs. The cumulative incidence of first SN was 3.0% (95% CI: 2.3%-3.9%) at 10 years, and 6.0% (95% CI: 4.6%-7.7%) at 20 years from diagnosis. Risks were highest for subsequent glioma, all grades (SIR = 57.2; 95% CI: 36.2-85.8) and acute myeloid leukemia (SIR = 31.8; 95% CI: 10.2-74.1). Compared with RT alone, RT + chemotherapy did not increase risk for SNs (hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.38-1.06). Among five-year survivors of medulloblastoma treated with multimodal therapy, cumulative incidence of SN was 12.0% (95% CI: 6.4%-19.5%) at 20 years, no different than survivors treated with RT alone (11.3%, P = .44). CONCLUSION: The cumulative incidence of SNs continues to increase with time from treatment with no obvious plateau, but the risk does not appear to be higher after exposure to multimodal therapy compared with RT alone. Continued follow-up of survivors as they age is essential.","['Tsui, Karen', 'Gajjar, Amar', 'Li, Chenghong', 'Srivastava, Deokumar', 'Broniscer, Alberto', 'Wetmore, Cynthia', 'Kun, Larry E', 'Merchant, Thomas E', 'Ellison, David W', 'Orr, Brent A', 'Boop, Frederick A', 'Klimo, Paul', 'Ross, Jordan', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Armstrong, Gregory T']","['Tsui K', 'Gajjar A', 'Li C', 'Srivastava D', 'Broniscer A', 'Wetmore C', 'Kun LE', 'Merchant TE', 'Ellison DW', 'Orr BA', 'Boop FA', 'Klimo P', 'Ross J', 'Robison LL', 'Armstrong GT']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee (K.T., A.B., A.G., C.W.);

These methyltransferases are ideal therapeutic targets due to their frequent hyperactive mutations and overexpression found in cancer, including hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we characterized a set of small molecules that allow pharmacologic manipulation of EZH2 and EZH1, which include UNC1999, a selective inhibitor of both enzymes, and UNC2400, an inactive analog compound useful for assessment of off-target effect. UNC1999 suppresses global H3K27 trimethylation/dimethylation (H3K27me3/2) and inhibits growth of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia cells. UNC1999-induced transcriptome alterations overlap those following knockdown of embryonic ectoderm development, a common cofactor of EZH2 and EZH1, demonstrating UNC1999's on-target inhibition. Mechanistically, UNC1999 preferentially affects distal regulatory elements such as enhancers, leading to derepression of polycomb targets including Cdkn2a. Gene derepression correlates with a decrease in H3K27me3 and concurrent gain in H3K27 acetylation. UNC2400 does not induce such effects. Oral administration of UNC1999 prolongs survival of a well-defined murine leukemia model bearing MLL-AF9. Collectively, our study provides the detailed profiling for a set of chemicals to manipulate EZH2 and EZH1 and establishes specific enzymatic inhibition of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-EZH2 and PRC2-EZH1 by small-molecule compounds as a novel therapeutics for MLL-rearranged leukemia.","['Xu, Bowen', 'On, Doan M', 'Ma, Anqi', 'Parton, Trevor', 'Konze, Kyle D', 'Pattenden, Samantha G', 'Allison, David F', 'Cai, Ling', 'Rockowitz, Shira', 'Liu, Shichong', 'Liu, Ying', 'Li, Fengling', 'Vedadi, Masoud', 'Frye, Stephen V', 'Garcia, Benjamin A', 'Zheng, Deyou', 'Jin, Jian', 'Wang, Gang Greg']","['Xu B', 'On DM', 'Ma A', 'Parton T', 'Konze KD', 'Pattenden SG', 'Allison DF', 'Cai L', 'Rockowitz S', 'Liu S', 'Liu Y', 'Li F', 'Vedadi M', 'Frye SV', 'Garcia BA', 'Zheng D', 'Jin J', 'Wang GG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC;', 'Department of Structural and Chemical Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY;', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC;', 'Department of Structural and Chemical Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY;', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC;', 'Department of Genetics, and Departments of Neurology and Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Ansary Stem Cell Institute and Department of Genetic Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC; Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Department of Genetics, and Departments of Neurology and Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY;', 'Department of Structural and Chemical Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141113,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35359-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-581082 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 8;125(2):346-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-581082.

The arsenic/interferon combination, which triggers degradation of the Tax oncoprotein, selectively induces apoptosis of ATL cell lines and has significant clinical activity in Tax-driven murine ATL or human patients. However, the role of Tax loss in ATL response is disputed, and the molecular mechanisms driving degradation remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that ATL-derived or HTLV-1-transformed cells are dependent on continuous Tax expression, suggesting that Tax degradation underlies clinical responses to the arsenic/interferon combination. The latter enforces promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear body (NB) formation and partner protein recruitment. In arsenic/interferon-treated HTLV-1 transformed or ATL cells, Tax is recruited onto NBs and undergoes PML-dependent hyper-sumoylation by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)2/3 but not SUMO1, ubiquitination by RNF4, and proteasome-dependent degradation. Thus, the arsenic/interferon combination clears ATL through degradation of its Tax driver, and this regimen could have broader therapeutic value by promoting degradation of other pathogenic sumoylated proteins.","['Dassouki, Zeina', 'Sahin, Umut', 'El Hajj, Hiba', 'Jollivet, Florence', 'Kfoury, Youmna', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'de The, Hugues', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Dassouki Z', 'Sahin U', 'El Hajj H', 'Jollivet F', 'Kfoury Y', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Hermine O', 'de The H', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France;', ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France;"", 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon;', ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France;"", 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon;', ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France;"", 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8147, Hopital Necker, Paris Cedex 15, France;', ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Biochimie, Hopital St. Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France; and College de France, Paris, France."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141113,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Reagents)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Reagents/pharmacology', 'Sumoylation/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/03/13 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35323-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-572750 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 15;125(3):474-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-572750.

However, the cardiotoxicity of long QT syndrome restricts its clinical application. Previous studies showed that As2O3 can damage the hERG current via disturbing its trafficking to cellular membrane. Consistent with these findings, in this study, we reported that As2O3 inhibited hERG channel at both protein and mRNA levels and damaged hERG current but did not affect channel kinetics. Further, we demonstrated that As2O3 up-regulated miR-21 and miR-23a expression in hERG-HEK293 cells and neonatal cardiomyocytes. In addition, knock-down of miR-21 by its specific antisense molecules AMO-21 was able to rescue Sp1 and hERG inhibition caused by As2O3. Consistently, phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, the upstream regulatory factor of miR-21, was significantly up-regulated by As2O3 . This finding revealed that regulation of the NF-kappaB-miR-21-Sp1 signalling pathway is a novel mechanism for As2O3-induced hERG inhibition. Meanwhile, the expression of Hsp90 and hERG was rescued by transfection with AMO-23a. And the hERG channel inhibition induced by As2O3 was rescued after being transfected with AMO-23a, which may be a molecular mechanism for the role of As2O3 in hERG trafficking deficiency. In brief, our study revealed that miR-21 and miR-23a are involved in As2O3-induced hERG deficiency at transcriptional and transportational levels. This discovery may provide a novel mechanism of As2O3-induced hERG channel deficiency, and these miRNAs may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the handling of As2O3 cardiotoxicity.","['Zhao, Xin', 'Shi, Yuan-Qi', 'Yan, Cai-Chuan', 'Feng, Pan-feng', 'Wang, Xue', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Zhang, Xiao', 'Li, Bao-Xin']","['Zhao X', 'Shi YQ', 'Yan CC', 'Feng PF', 'Wang X', 'Zhang R', 'Zhang X', 'Li BX']","['Department of Pharmacology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141217,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (Kcnh1 protein, rat)', '0 (MIRN23 microRNA, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Potassium Channel Blockers)', '0 (mirn21 microRNA, rat)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*deficiency/drug effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2014/11/15 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bcpt.12348 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2015 Jun;116(6):516-23. doi: 10.1111/bcpt.12348.

Impact of virus quality and spike level on virus removal with xenotropic murine leukemia virus.,135-44,10.1002/btpr.2020 [doi],"Virus filtration (VF) is a key step in an overall viral clearance process since it has been demonstrated to effectively clear a wide range of mammalian viruses with a log reduction value (LRV) > 4. The potential to achieve higher LRV from virus retentive filters has historically been examined using bacteriophage surrogates, which commonly demonstrated a potential of > 9 LRV when using high titer spikes (e.g. 10(10) PFU/mL). However, as the filter loading increases, one typically experiences significant decreases in performance and LRV. The 9 LRV value is markedly higher than the current expected range of 4-5 LRV when utilizing mammalian retroviruses on virus removal filters (Miesegaes et al., Dev Biol (Basel) 2010;133:3-101). Recent values have been reported in the literature (Stuckey et al., Biotech Progr 2014;30:79-85) of LRV in excess of 6 for PPV and XMuLV although this result appears to be atypical. LRV for VF with therapeutic proteins could be limited by several factors including process limits (flux decay, load matrix), virus spike level and the analytical methods used for virus detection (i.e. the Limits of Quantitation), as well as the virus spike quality. Research was conducted using the Xenotropic-Murine Leukemia Virus (XMuLV) for its direct relevance to the most commonly cited document, the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) Q5A (International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, Geneva, Switzerland, 1999) for viral safety evaluations. A unique aspect of this work is the independent evaluation of the impact of retrovirus quality and virus spike level on VF performance and LRV. The VF studies used XMuLV preparations purified by either ultracentrifugation (Ultra 1) or by chromatographic processes that yielded a more highly purified virus stock (Ultra 2). Two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) with markedly different filtration characteristics and with similar levels of aggregate (<1.5%) were evaluated with the Ultra 1 and Ultra 2 virus preparations utilizing the Planova 20 N, a small virus removal filter. Impurities in the virus preparation ultimately limited filter loading as measured by determining the volumetric loading condition where 75% flux decay is observed versus initial conditions (V75). This observation occurred with both Mabs with the difference in virus purity more pronounced when very high spike levels were used (>5 vol/vol %). Significant differences were seen for the process performance over a number of lots of the less-pure Ultra 1 virus preparations. Experiments utilizing a developmental lot of the chromatographic purified XMuLV (Ultra 2 Development lot) that had elevated levels of host cell residuals (vs. the final Ultra 2 preparations) suggest that these contaminant residuals can impact virus filter fouling, even if the virus prep is essentially monodisperse. Process studies utilizing an Ultra 2 virus with substantially less host cell residuals and highly monodispersed virus particles demonstrated superior performance and an LRV in excess of 7.7 log10 . A model was constructed demonstrating the linear dependence of filtration flux versus filter loading which can be used to predict the V75 for a range of virus spike levels conditions using this highly purified virus. Fine tuning the virus spike level with this model can ultimately maximize the LRV for the virus filter step, essentially adding the LRV equivalent of another process step (i.e. protein A or CEX chromatography).","['Roush, David J', 'Myrold, Adam', 'Burnham, Michael S', 'And, Joseph V', 'Hughes, Joseph V']","['Roush DJ', 'Myrold A', 'Burnham MS', 'And JV', 'Hughes JV']","['Merck, Sharp and Dohme, Biologics Process Development, Process Development & Engineering, Mailstop K15-2-H206, Kenilworth, NJ, 07033.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141129,United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/isolation & purification', 'Biotechnology/*methods/*standards', 'Dynamic Light Scattering', 'Filtration/*standards', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Models, Biological', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/standards', 'Safety', 'Viral Plaque Assay']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/btpr.2020 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2015 Jan-Feb;31(1):135-44. doi: 10.1002/btpr.2020.

An oncogenic super-enhancer formed through somatic mutation of a noncoding intergenic element.,1373-7,10.1126/science.1259037 [doi],"In certain human cancers, the expression of critical oncogenes is driven from large regulatory elements, called super-enhancers, that recruit much of the cell's transcriptional apparatus and are defined by extensive acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac). In a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, we found that heterozygous somatic mutations are acquired that introduce binding motifs for the MYB transcription factor in a precise noncoding site, which creates a super-enhancer upstream of the TAL1 oncogene. MYB binds to this new site and recruits its H3K27 acetylase-binding partner CBP, as well as core components of a major leukemogenic transcriptional complex that contains RUNX1, GATA-3, and TAL1 itself. Additionally, most endogenous super-enhancers found in T-ALL cells are occupied by MYB and CBP, which suggests a general role for MYB in super-enhancer initiation. Thus, this study identifies a genetic mechanism responsible for the generation of oncogenic super-enhancers in malignant cells.","['Mansour, Marc R', 'Abraham, Brian J', 'Anders, Lars', 'Berezovskaya, Alla', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Durbin, Adam D', 'Etchin, Julia', 'Lawton, Lee', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Young, Richard A', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Mansour MR', 'Abraham BJ', 'Anders L', 'Berezovskaya A', 'Gutierrez A', 'Durbin AD', 'Etchin J', 'Lawton L', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Loh ML', 'Hunger SP', 'Sanda T', 'Young RA', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

The role of liver transplantation as a treatment option has been discussed since 1976. Many cases are related to underlying myeloproliferative neoplasms associated with prothrombotic propensity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcome after liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome at our center, with special emphasis on recurrent thrombosis and underlying myeloproliferative disorders. MATERIAL/METHODS: A medical records search revealed 25 patients transplanted at our center for Budd-Chiari syndrome between 2000 and 2009. Indications for transplantation were complications of end-stage liver disease or acute liver failure. RESULTS: Ten patients were men (40.0%). Median age of recipients at transplantation was 29.0 (17-51) years. Eighteen patients (72%) had evidence of myeloproliferation, 1 had paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and 6 had idiopathic disease. In 55.5% of cases eventually diagnosed with myeloproliferative neoplasms, Budd-Chiari syndrome was their initial presentation. All patients were maintained on long-term post-transplant anticoagulation protocol. The median follow-up time was 58.8 months. Four patients (16%) died during follow-up. Acute graft rejection occurred in 16% of cases. During the observation period, 5 patients had recurrent thrombotic events. The 5-year patient and graft survival rate was 84%. No case of transformation to acute leukemia was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show satisfactory long-term survival of patients and grafts in the study group. Occult course of myeloproliferative neoplasms is frequent in this population and exceeds 50%. We observed recurrent thrombosis in 20% of recipients.","['Oldakowska-Jedynak, Urszula', 'Ziarkiewicz, Mateusz', 'Ziarkiewicz-Wroblewska, Bogna', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, Jadwiga', 'Gornicka, Barbara', 'Nyckowski, Pawel', 'Paluszkiewicz, Rafal', 'Wroblewski, Tadeusz', 'Zieniewicz, Krzysztof', 'Patkowski, Waldemar', 'Paczek, Leszek', 'Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw Wiktor', 'Krawczyk, Marek']","['Oldakowska-Jedynak U', 'Ziarkiewicz M', 'Ziarkiewicz-Wroblewska B', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J', 'Gornicka B', 'Nyckowski P', 'Paluszkiewicz R', 'Wroblewski T', 'Zieniewicz K', 'Patkowski W', 'Paczek L', 'Jedrzejczak WW', 'Krawczyk M']","['Department of General, Transplantation and Liver Surgery, Medical Univeristy of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Biostructure Research, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Biostructure Research, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of General, Transplantation and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of General, Transplantation and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of General, Transplantation and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of General, Transplantation and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of General, Transplantation and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of General, Transplantation and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141114,United States,Ann Transplant,Annals of transplantation,9802544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Budd-Chiari Syndrome/etiology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/epidemiology', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombosis/*complications', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['890834 [pii]', '10.12659/AOT.890834 [doi]']",epublish,Ann Transplant. 2014 Nov 14;19:591-7. doi: 10.12659/AOT.890834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of MDS is thought to evolve from accumulation and selection of specific genetic or epigenetic events. Emerging evidence indicates that MDS is not solely a hematopoietic disease but rather affects the entire bone marrow microenvironment, including bone metabolism. Many of these cells, in particular mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) and osteoblasts, express a number of adhesion molecules and secreted factors that regulate blood regeneration throughout life by contributing to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) maintenance, self-renewal and differentiation. Several endocrine factors, such as erythropoietin, parathyroid hormone and estrogens, as well as deranged iron metabolism modulate these processes. Thus, interactions between MSPC and HSPC contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS and associated pathologies. A detailed understanding of these mechanisms may help to define novel targets for diagnosis and possibly therapy. In this review, we will discuss the scientific rationale of 'osteohematology' as an emerging research field in MDS and outline clinical implications.","['Bulycheva, E', 'Rauner, M', 'Medyouf, H', 'Theurl, I', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Hofbauer, L C', 'Platzbecker, U']","['Bulycheva E', 'Rauner M', 'Medyouf H', 'Theurl I', 'Bornhauser M', 'Hofbauer LC', 'Platzbecker U']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl-Gustav-Carus, Technische Universitat, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik III, Universitatsklinikum Carl-Gustav-Carus, Technische Universitat, Dresden, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institut for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine VI, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', '1] Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl-Gustav-Carus, Technische Universitat, Dresden, Germany [2] Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Technical University, Dresden, Germany.', '1] Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik III, Universitatsklinikum Carl-Gustav-Carus, Technische Universitat, Dresden, Germany [2] Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Technical University, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl-Gustav-Carus, Technische Universitat, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141114,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Iron/chemistry', 'Iron Overload/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology', 'Parathyroid Hormone/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014325 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.325 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Feb;29(2):259-68. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.325.

Resistance attributable to either kinase mutations in BCR/ABL or nonmutational mechanisms remains the major clinical challenge. With the exception of ponatinib, all approved TKIs are unable to inhibit the 'gatekeeper' mutation T315I. However, a broad spectrum of kinase inhibition increases the off-target effects of TKIs and may be responsible for cardiovascular issues of ponatinib. Thus, there is a need for more selective options for the treatment of resistant Ph+ leukemias. PF-114 is a novel TKI developed with the specifications of (i) targeting T315I and other resistance mutations in BCR/ABL; (ii) achieving a high selectivity to improve safety; and (iii) overcoming nonmutational resistance in Ph+ leukemias. PF-114 inhibited BCR/ABL and clinically important mutants including T315I at nanomolar concentrations. It suppressed primary Ph+ acute lymphatic leukemia-derived long-term cultures that either displayed nonmutational resistance or harbor the T315I. In BCR/ABL- or BCR/ABL-T315I-driven murine leukemia as well as in xenograft models of primary Ph+ leukemia harboring the T315I, PF-114 significantly prolonged survival to a similar extent as ponatinib.

Here, we show that elevated expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), but not of other glycolytic enzymes tested, increased aggressiveness and vascularization of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Elevated GAPDH expression was found to promote nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation via binding to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), enhancing the transcription and the activity of hypoxia-inducing factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Consistent with this, inactive mutants of GAPDH failed to bind TRAF2, enhance HIF-1 activity or promote lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, elevated expression of gapdh mRNA in biopsies from diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients correlated with high levels of hif-1alpha, vegf-a, nfkbia mRNA and CD31 staining. Collectively, these data indicate that deregulated GAPDH expression promotes NF-kappaB-dependent induction of HIF-1alpha and has a key role in lymphoma vascularization and aggressiveness.","['Chiche, J', 'Pommier, S', 'Beneteau, M', 'Mondragon, L', 'Meynet, O', 'Zunino, B', 'Mouchotte, A', 'Verhoeyen, E', 'Guyot, M', 'Pages, G', 'Mounier, N', 'Imbert, V', 'Colosetti, P', 'Goncalves, D', 'Marchetti, S', 'Briere, J', 'Carles, M', 'Thieblemont, C', 'Ricci, J-E']","['Chiche J', 'Pommier S', 'Beneteau M', 'Mondragon L', 'Meynet O', 'Zunino B', 'Mouchotte A', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Guyot M', 'Pages G', 'Mounier N', 'Imbert V', 'Colosetti P', 'Goncalves D', 'Marchetti S', 'Briere J', 'Carles M', 'Thieblemont C', 'Ricci JE']","[""1] Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 'controle metabolique des morts cellulaires', equipe 3, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France."", ""1] Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 'controle metabolique des morts cellulaires', equipe 3, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France [3] Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice, Departement d'Anesthesie Reanimation, Nice, France."", ""1] Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 'controle metabolique des morts cellulaires', equipe 3, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France."", ""1] Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 'controle metabolique des morts cellulaires', equipe 3, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France."", ""1] Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 'controle metabolique des morts cellulaires', equipe 3, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France."", ""1] Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 'controle metabolique des morts cellulaires', equipe 3, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France."", ""1] Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 'controle metabolique des morts cellulaires', equipe 3, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France."", ""1] Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 'controle metabolique des morts cellulaires', equipe 3, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France."", '1] Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France [2] Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging, CNRS UMR 7284/U INSERM 1081, Centre A.

In cancer patients, lactic acidosis is mainly associated with hematologic malignancies (leukemia and lymphomas) and the mechanism is known as Warburg's effect. We report a 76-year-old male known to have hypertension and coronary artery disease, who presented with abdominal distension and lactic acidosis. His initial evaluation showed multiple liver masses that were biopsied and the patient was diagnosed with undifferentiated carcinoma of unknown primary, involving the liver. The patient had progression of lactic acidosis leading to his death on day-15. As the lactic acidosis was not in the setting of hypoxia or hemodynamic instability, we made the diagnosis of malignancy-associated type B lactic acidosis, also known as the Warburg's effect. Warburg's effect can occur in solid cancer if the tumor involves the liver. It has bad prognostic implications. The use of intravenous bicarbonate as a temporary measure is of controversial benefit, as it can potentially worsen the metabolic acidosis and its use should be limited to patients with very low pH. In cancer patients, the use of lactatebased intravenous fluids can be potentially harmful and can increase the risk of tumor metastasis, at least in animal malignancy models.","['El Imad, Talal', 'El Khoury, Lara', 'Geara, Abdallah Sassine']","['El Imad T', 'El Khoury L', 'Geara AS']","['Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon, .']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Saudi Arabia,Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl,"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",9436968,['0 (Bicarbonates)'],IM,"['Acidosis, Lactic/diagnosis/*etiology/metabolism/therapy', 'Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/*etiology/metabolism/therapy', 'Administration, Intravenous', 'Aged', 'Bicarbonates/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Fluid Therapy', '*Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Liver Neoplasms/*complications/metabolism/*secondary', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Unknown Primary', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2014/11/15 06:00,2015/04/16 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['SaudiJKidneyDisTranspl_2014_25_6_1270_144266 [pii]', '10.4103/1319-2442.144266 [doi]']",ppublish,Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl. 2014 Nov;25(6):1270-7. doi: 10.4103/1319-2442.144266.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Raltegravir could be an adequate option through its favourable drug-drug interaction profile. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study of HIV patients with cancer, AIDS related or not, undergoing chemotherapy. Patients without resistance or previous failure were switched or initiated raltegravir plus two nucleoside analogues. Plasma trough levels of raltegravir were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 28 patients receiving a raltegravir-based regimen (4 naive) with tenofovir-emtricitabine (18 cases) or abacavir-lamivudine (10 cases) were included. Mean age was 46.2 years (IQR, 39-52.7), and 79% were male. Median time of HIV was 201.7 months, CD4+ nadir was 268 cells/mm(3), and 75% had previous AIDS. At the diagnosis of neoplasia, 17 were on protease inhibitors and 4 with efavirenz. Ten patients had a non-HIV-related cancer (three breast, two pancreatic, one Ewing sarcoma, one myeloblastic leukemia, one melanoma, one parotid adenocarcinoma, one lung), and 18 had an HIV-related cancer (nine non-Hodgkin lymphoma, seven Hodgkin disease, two anal). Overall, 43% of patients received more than one line of chemotherapy, including antimetabolites in 12 patients (5-FU, capecitabine, methotrexate, gemcitabine), alkylating agents in 12 cases (ciclophosphamide, iphosphamide), vinca alkaloids in 20 patients (vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine), antitumor antibiotics in 16 cases (adriamycin), cisplatin o carboplatin in six and monoclonal antibodies in six patients (rituximab, trastuzumab, cetuximab). Six patients modified the doses of antineoplastic agents due to toxicity (four neutropenia), not related to raltegravir. During a median follow up of 12.7 patients-year in concomitant therapy, there was only 1 case of virological failure and no patient discontinued raltegravir. Plasma concentrations of raltegravir in eight patients showed a median concentration of 143 ng/mL (79-455). Four patients (14%) died during the study, not related to AIDS progression. Raltegravir was continued after chemotherapy in all the cases. CONCLUSIONS: A raltegravir-based therapy is safe and effective in HIV patients undergoing antineoplastic chemotherapy, regardless of the type of tumour, and type and duration of chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic data show adequate raltegravir levels.","['Banon, Sara', 'Machuca, Isabel', 'Araujo, Susana', 'Moreno, Ana', 'Perez-Elias, Maria J', 'Moreno, Santiago', 'Casado, Jose Luis']","['Banon S', 'Machuca I', 'Araujo S', 'Moreno A', 'Perez-Elias MJ', 'Moreno S', 'Casado JL']","['Infectious Diseases, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141102,Switzerland,J Int AIDS Soc,Journal of the International AIDS Society,101478566,,,,2014/11/14 06:00,2014/11/14 06:01,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/14 06:01 [medline]']","['19590 [pii]', '10.7448/IAS.17.4.19590 [doi]']",epublish,J Int AIDS Soc. 2014 Nov 2;17(4 Suppl 3):19590. doi: 10.7448/IAS.17.4.19590. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4224893,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these cells have developed strategies to downregulate NKG2DL expression and avoid immune recognition. We demonstrate that DNA methylation can contribute to the absence of NKG2DL expression during tumor progression. We analyzed the DNA methylation profiles for each NKG2DL by pyrosequencing in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), hepatocellular carcinoma (HC), breast cancer and colon cancer cell lines. High levels of DNA methylation for NKG2DL were found in some tumor cell lines, mainly in AML cells. This hypermethylation was correlated with the absence of transcription for NKG2DL. Higher DNA methylation levels for MICA, ULBP1 and ULBP2 were observed in AML patients (n=60) compared with healthy donors (n=25). However, no DNA methylation for NKG2DL was found in colon cancer patients (n=44). Treatment with demethylating agents (5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) restored the expression of NKG2DL on the cell surface of AML cells, leading to an enhanced recognition by NKG2D-expressing cells. Our data suggest that NKG2DL may be aberrantly silenced by DNA methylation as a consequence of tumor development in AML patients.","['Baragano Raneros, A', 'Martin-Palanco, V', 'Fernandez, A F', 'Rodriguez, R M', 'Fraga, M F', 'Lopez-Larrea, C', 'Suarez-Alvarez, B']","['Baragano Raneros A', 'Martin-Palanco V', 'Fernandez AF', 'Rodriguez RM', 'Fraga MF', 'Lopez-Larrea C', 'Suarez-Alvarez B']","['Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Area of Cell Therapy, Hospital Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA-HUCA), Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA-HUCA), Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', ""1] Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain [2] Fundacion Renal 'Inigo Alvarez de Toledo', Madrid, Spain."", 'Cellular Biology of Renal Diseases Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Universidad Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141113,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/immunology/*metabolism', '*Tumor Escape']",2014/11/14 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gene201458 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2014.58 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2015 Jan-Feb;16(1):71-82. doi: 10.1038/gene.2014.58.

Our objective was to review the indications, survival, and late effects of infants who received HSCT. PROCEDURE: Between April 1992 and March 2010, a total of 1,363 children underwent HSCT (775 allogeneic [allo]; 588 autologous [auto]) in the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. Of these, 51 (3.7%) were infants. RESULTS: Seventeen infants received allo HSCT for a genetic metabolic disorder. The median age at HSCT was 211 days (29-334 days). After median follow-up of 8.9 years (2.9-20.2 years), 12 patients remained alive, representing an overall survival rate of 70%. Infants with non-metabolic disorders (n = 34); 10 (three neuroblastoma [NBL], three brain tumor, two acute meylogenous leukemia [AML], one rhabdomyosarcoma, and one retinoblastoma) received auto HSCT, and 24 (eight hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [HLH], four juvenile meylomonocytic leukemia [JMML], four Wiscott-Aldrych Syndrome [WAS], three acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], two AML, one severe aplastic anemia [SAA], one chronic granulomatous disease [CGD], and one amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia) received allo HSCT. Their median age at HSCT was 255 days (142-365 days). At median follow-up of 8.7 years (2.5-17.6 years), 26 infants remained alive, representing an overall survival rate of 76%. In the auto HSCT category, eight of 10 infants are long-term survivors. Late effects such as organ dysfunction, endocrinopathy, and secondary tumors were within accepted range. CONCLUSION: The survival rate of infants who receive HSCT is encouraging.","['Gassas, Adam', 'Ashraf, Kaleem', 'Zaidman, Irina', 'Ali, Muhammad', 'Krueger, Joerg', 'Doyle, John', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Leucht, Stephan']","['Gassas A', 'Ashraf K', 'Zaidman I', 'Ali M', 'Krueger J', 'Doyle J', 'Schechter T', 'Leucht S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141112,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Autografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate']",2014/11/14 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25333 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Mar;62(3):517-21. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25333.

We performed a cohort simulation over a life-long time-horizon from a societal perspective. Nilotinib without second-line TKI yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio of 121,400 euro/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to imatinib without second-line TKI after imatinib failure. Imatinib followed by nilotinib after failure resulted in 131,100 euro/QALY compared to nilotinib without second-line TKI. Nilotinib followed by dasatinib yielded 152,400 euro/QALY compared to imatinib followed by nilotinib after failure. Remaining strategies were dominated.

In this study we prospectively studied Treg (CD3+CD4+CD25highCD127low), interleukin-10 (IL-10) producing Treg and T-helper 17 (Th17) (CD3+CD4+IL-17+) cells in 40 treatment-naive patients with CLL. The percentage of Th17 and not Treg cells was significantly higher in the AIC cohort than in those without AIC (p<0.0001). The Treg:Th17 ratio was skewed in favor of Th17 in the AIC cohort (p=0.02). Th17 cells are responsible for AIC of CLL. Analysis of lymph-node aspirates showed that the percentage of Treg and IL-10 expression in Treg and not Th17 was significantly higher than in peripheral blood (p<0.01). Treg cells play a major role in the microenvironment where disease progression occurs. This shows the importance of maintaining the Treg:Th17 equilibrium, for imbalance leads to CLL progression or AIC.","['Lad, Deepesh P', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Sachdeva, Man Updesh Singh', 'Bose, Parveen', 'Malhotra, Pankaj']","['Lad DP', 'Varma S', 'Varma N', 'Sachdeva MU', 'Bose P', 'Malhotra P']","['a Department of Internal Medicine , Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine , Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'b Department of Hematology , Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'b Department of Hematology , Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'b Department of Hematology , Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine , Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150121,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', '*Autoimmunity', 'Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cellular Microenvironment/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/*immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pancytopenia/blood/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/metabolism']",2014/11/14 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.986479 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(8):2424-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.986479.

An addition of isoprenoid, geranylgeraniol but not farnesol, negated these ZOL-induced effects, indicating that the ZOL-mediated effects were attributable to depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates which were substrates for prenylation processes of small guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (small G proteins). ZOL-treated cells decreased a ratio of membrane to cytoplasmic fractions in RhoA, Cdc42 and Rab6 but less significantly Rac1 proteins, indicating that these proteins were possible targets for ZOL-induced actions. We further analyzed which small G proteins were responsible for the three ZOL-induced effects, caspase-mediated apoptosis, S-phase arrest and morphological changes, using inhibitors for respective small G proteins and siRNA for Cdc42. ZOL-induced apoptosis is due to insufficient prenylation of Rab proteins because an inhibitor of geranlygeranyl transferase II that was specific for Rab family proteins prenylation, but not others inhibitors, activated the same apoptotic pathways that ZOL did. ZOL suppressed an endogenous topoisomerase II activity, which was associated with apoptosis and S-phase arrest in respective cells because we detected the same cell cycle changes in etoposide-treated cells. Inhibitors for geranlygeranyl transferase I and for RhoA produced morphological changes and disrupted actin fiber structures, both of which were similar to those by ZOL treatments. These data demonstrated that anti-tumor effects by ZOL were attributable to inhibited functions of respective small G proteins and topoisomerase II activity, and suggested that cellular factors were involved in the differential cell cycle changes.","['Okamoto, S', 'Jiang, Y', 'Kawamura, K', 'Shingyoji, M', 'Tada, Y', 'Sekine, I', 'Takiguchi, Y', 'Tatsumi, K', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Shimada, H', 'Hiroshima, K', 'Tagawa, M']","['Okamoto S', 'Jiang Y', 'Kawamura K', 'Shingyoji M', 'Tada Y', 'Sekine I', 'Takiguchi Y', 'Tatsumi K', 'Kobayashi H', 'Shimada H', 'Hiroshima K', 'Tagawa M']","['1] Division of Pathology and Cell Therapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Respirology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Division of Pathology and Cell Therapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Molecular Biology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology and Cell Therapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Disease, Chiba Cancer Center, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Respirology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Respirology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Toho University, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Pathology, Tokyo Women's Medical University Yachiyo Medical Center, Chiba, Japan."", '1] Division of Pathology and Cell Therapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Molecular Biology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141113,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (GGTI 2147)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Rab geranylgeranyl transferase beta-subunit)', '0 (Rab6 protein)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', '4602-84-0 (Farnesol)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', 'AIA02AJA3A (geranylgeraniol)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'Diphosphonates/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Farnesol/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leucine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mesothelioma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Prenylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'S Phase/*drug effects/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Zoledronic Acid', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2014/11/14 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014475 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.475 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Nov 13;5:e1517. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.475.,,,,PMC4260733,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two policies funding for the catastrophic diseases and the new rural cooperative medical care system (NRCMS) were initiated in 2005 and 2011, respectively. About 1151 children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled in our study during this period and 316 cases abandoned treatment. Statistical differences in sex, age, number of children in the family, and family financial status were observed. Of most importance, the medical insurance coverage was critical for reducing abandonment treatment. However, 92 cases abandoning treatment after relapse did not show significant difference either in medical insurance coverage or in duration from first complete remission. In conclusion, financial crisis was the main reason for abandoning treatment.

The expression of the ABC transporters MDR1, ABCC1, ABCG2, and CXCL12 was significantly higher in the bone marrow samples of CML blast crisis than in those of CML chronic phase. Immunohistochemical staining for CXCL12 revealed that the proportion of CXCL12 positive reticular cell areas correlated well with the mRNA levels of CXCL12 in CML bone marrow. Finally, co-culture experiments of K562 CML cells with CXCL12 expressing mesenchymal cells (OP9 cells or human CXCL12 transfected 3T3 cells) revealed enhanced mRNA levels for MDR1 in a CXCL12 rich environment.These results suggest that imatinib treatment restores the bone marrow microenvironment in CML with the presence of CXCL12 expressing reticular cells but in turn induces the overexpression of MDR1 in haematopoietic cells due to up-regulated expression of CXCL12.","['Onishi, Iichiroh', 'Nakagawa, Yasunori', 'Murayama, Toshihiko', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Yamamoto, Kouhei', 'Abe-Suzuki, Shiho', 'Abe, Shinya', 'Kurata, Morito', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Onishi I', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Murayama T', 'Hidaka M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Abe-Suzuki S', 'Abe S', 'Kurata M', 'Kitagawa M']","['1Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 2Department of Internal Medicine, Japan Red-Cross Medical Center, Tokyo 3Department of Pathology 4Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2014/11/14 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAT.0000000000000180 [doi]', '01268031-201412000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathology. 2014 Dec;46(7):623-9. doi: 10.1097/PAT.0000000000000180.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch has been initially found in T-ALL but its role has been also studied in myelopoiesis and myeloid leukemias. Studies in different model systems have led to a widespread controversy as to whether Notch promotes or blocks myeloid differentiation. In this work, we evaluated the influence of Notch activation on leukemic cell differentiation along the monocytic and myelocytic pathway induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We observed that differentiation of the human myeloblastic cell line HL-60 can be retarded or blocked by Delta/Notch interaction. ATRA induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, but it cannot completely eliminate the leukemic clone and to be effective it should be combined with chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that Notch signaling may contribute to the incomplete elimination of the leukemic cells after PMA or ATRA treatment and the blockage of Notch pathway may be beneficial in the treatment of myeloid leukemia.

Its sensitivity to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which causes differentiation of the abnormal promyelocytes, combined with anthracycline based chemotherapy makes it the best curable subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is needed in the first place to prevent (more) bleeding problems. Here we present a patient with a leukemia with an APL-like morphology but no detectable PML-RARA fusion, as demonstrated by RT-PCR and cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, karyotyping revealed numerous double minutes (dmins). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes specific for the MYC-region showed the presence of multiple MYC amplicons. SNP-array analysis uncovered amplification of the 8q24.13-q24.21 region, including the MYC-gene, flanked by deletions in 8q24.13 and 8q24.21-q24.22, and a homozygous deletion in 9p21.3, flanked by heterozygous deletions in the same chromosome region.

Here, we test this hypothesis using experimental evolution of a mouse-specific retroviral pathogen, Friend virus (FV) complex. We demonstrate rapid fitness (i.e. viral titre) and virulence increases when FV complex serially infects a series of inbred mice representing the same genotype, but not when infecting a diverse array of inbred mouse strains modelling the diversity in natural host populations. Additionally, a single infection of a different host genotype was sufficient to constrain the emergence of a high fitness/high virulence FV complex phenotype in these experiments. The potent inhibition of viral fitness and virulence was associated with an observed loss of the defective retroviral genome (spleen focus-forming virus), whose presence exacerbates infection and drives disease in susceptible mice. Results from our experiments provide an important first step in understanding how genetic variation among vertebrate hosts influences pathogen evolution and suggests that serial exposure to different genotypes within a single host species may act as a constraint on pathogen adaptation that prohibits the emergence of more virulent infections. From a practical perspective, these results have implications for low-diversity host populations such as endangered species and domestic animals.","['Kubinak, Jason L', 'Cornwall, Douglas H', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Adler, Frederick R', 'Potts, Wayne K']","['Kubinak JL', 'Cornwall DH', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Adler FR', 'Potts WK']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Utah, 15 North Medical Drive East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA jason.kubinak@path.utah.edu.', 'Department of Biology, University of Utah, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 903 South 4th St., Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Utah, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA Department of Mathematics, University of Utah, 155 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Utah, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Proc Biol Sci,Proceedings.

Lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1), a Wnt-mediating transcription factor important for cell survival and metastasis in cancer, is produced via IRES-directed translation, and its mRNA is frequently upregulated in malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). In this study, we determined that LEF1 expression is regulated by Bcr-Abl, the oncogenic protein that drives haematopoietic cell transformation to CML. We have previously shown that the LEF1 5' untranslated region recruits a complex of proteins to its IRES, including the translation initiation factor eIF4A. In this report, we use two small molecule inhibitors, PP242 (dual mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) kinase inhibitor) and hippuristanol (eIF4A inhibitor), to define IRES regulation via a Bcr-Abl-mTOR-eIF4A axis in CML cell lines and primary patient leukaemias. We found that LEF1 and other IRESs are uniquely sensitive to the activities of Bcr-Abl/mTOR. Most notably, we discovered that eIF4A, an RNA helicase, elicits potent non-canonical effects on the LEF1 IRES. Hippuristanol inhibition of eIF4A stalls translation of IRES mRNA and triggers dissociation from polyribosomes. We propose that a combination drug strategy which targets mTOR and IRES-driven translation disrupts key factors that contribute to growth and proliferation in CML.","['Tsai, Becky Pinjou', 'Jimenez, Judith', 'Lim, Sharon', 'Fitzgerald, Kerry D', 'Zhang, Min', 'Chuah, Charles T H', 'Axelrod, Haley', 'Wilson, Luke', 'Ong, S Tiong', 'Semler, Bert L', 'Waterman, Marian L']","['Tsai BP', 'Jimenez J', 'Lim S', 'Fitzgerald KD', 'Zhang M', 'Chuah CT', 'Axelrod H', 'Wilson L', 'Ong ST', 'Semler BL', 'Waterman ML']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre, Singapore Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA marian.waterman@uci.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Open Biol,Open biology,101580419,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sterols)', '0 (hippuristanol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A)', 'H5669VNZ7V (PP242)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sterols/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2014/11/14 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['rsob.140180 [pii]', '10.1098/rsob.140180 [doi]']",ppublish,Open Biol. 2014 Nov;4(11):140180. doi: 10.1098/rsob.140180.,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'IRES', 'LEF-1', 'PP242', 'eIF4A', 'mTOR']","['GM067285/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA107041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 096878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB004436/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', '1R21 CA112936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI026765/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA133275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA133275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA062203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21 CA105514/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA062203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4248067,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1995-802X'],,,,,,,,,,,

In current phase III trials, standard treatment options were established that differ mainly based on the fitness and age of the patient. The combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and the CD20 antibody rituximab (FCR) is recommended for young patients without relevant comorbidity, while bendamustine and rituximab (BR) should be favored for elderly (ca. >65 years) fit individuals. Bendamustine plus ofatumumab is another option in this situation. Patients with major comorbidities should receive chlorambucil combined with CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab or ofatumumab). In 2014, several new compounds were approved for patients with ultrahigh risk genetic factors (17p-, TP53mut) and for relapsed/refractory CLL: both idelalisib and ibrutinib are orally bioavailable kinase inhibitors that block key regulators of central pathways. For both agents, very impressive data are available with regard to tolerability and efficacy that will change the treatment paradigm in CLL. With ABT-199, a direct apoptosis inducer is being developed that in early clinical trials produced high remission rates combined with good tolerability. Combinations and sequences of the ""novel"" compounds obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, idelalisib, ibrutinib, and ABT-199 will be studied in coming years in clinical trials in order to prolong remission duration and reduce side effects with the eventual aim of curing CLL.","['Tausch, E', 'Stilgenbauer, S']","['Tausch E', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081, Ulm, Deutschland.']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Internist (Berl),Der Internist,0264620,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/11/14 06:00,2015/08/14 06:00,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00108-014-3556-0 [doi]'],ppublish,"Internist (Berl). 2014 Dec;55(12):1400, 1402-4, 1406-9. doi: 10.1007/s00108-014-3556-0.",,,,,,Chronische lymphatische Leukamie: aktuelle Standards und neue Therapieansatze.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Healthy Sprague-Dawley mice were randomly allocated into 4 groups of control (group A), controlled ovarian hyperstimulation [COH (group B)], COH plus low-dose Kuntai Capsules (group C) and COH plus large-dose Kuntai Capsules [2x low-dose (group D)]. The controlled ovarian hyperstimulation model was established. The endometrial thickness was measured by computerized multi-functional image analyzer. And the expressions of LIF and EGF in proliferating endometrium were examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The endometrial thickness of groups C and D were higher than that of groups A and B. And there were significant differences (P < 0.05). The expression levels of LIF protein in proliferating endometrium was weaker than implantation window phase, the expression levels of EGF and LIF in group B was weaker than group A, groups C and D stronger than groups B and D was stronger than group C. And there were significant differences (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Kuntai Capsules can promote the growth of endometrium and enhance the expression levels of EGF and LIF in mice. And it may improve the ability of endometrial receptivity through optimized microenvironment. And a larger dose of Kuntai Capsules yields better outcomes.","['Chu, Xiying', 'Song, Yuxia', 'Wan, Lijing', 'Tan, Li']","['Chu X', 'Song Y', 'Wan L', 'Tan L']","['Reproductive Center, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450014, China.', 'Reproductive Center, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450014, China.', 'Reproductive Center, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450014, China.', 'Reproductive Center, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450014, China.

Recently, the International Agency for Cancer Research concluded that there is sufficient evidence that FA causes leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia. To evaluate the biological plausibility of this association, we employed a chromosome-wide aneuploidy study approach, which allows the evaluation of aneuploidy and structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) of all 24 chromosomes simultaneously, to analyze cultured myeloid progenitor cells from 29 workers exposed to relatively high levels of FA and 23 unexposed controls. We found statistically significant increases in the frequencies of monosomy, trisomy, tetrasomy and SCAs of multiple chromosomes in exposed workers compared with controls, with particularly notable effects for monosomy 1 [P = 6.02E-06, incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 2.31], monosomy 5 (P = 9.01E-06; IRR = 2.24), monosomy 7 (P = 1.57E-05; IRR = 2.17), trisomy 5 (P = 1.98E-05; IRR = 3.40) and SCAs of chromosome 5 (P = 0.024; IRR = 4.15). The detection of increased levels of monosomy 7 and SCAs of chromosome 5 is particularly relevant as they are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia. Our findings provide further evidence that leukemia-related cytogenetic changes can occur in the circulating myeloid progenitor cells of healthy workers exposed to FA, which may be a potential mechanism underlying FA-induced leukemogenesis.","['Lan, Qing', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Tang, Xiaojiang', 'Guo, Weihong', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Ji, Zhiying', 'Hu, Wei', 'Hubbard, Alan E', 'Shen, Min',

Atrio-ventricular septal defect (AVSD) is the most common congenital heart disease (CHD) reported in DS. The mortality rate of DS with congenital heart disease (CHD) is 5-7 times higher than normal population. The survival rate in DS has improved with time and has reported up to 91% and 85% at one and ten years of age, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of CHD, clinical course, treatment, the overall survival in patients with DS compare with those who are associated with CHD. STUDY DESIGNS: DS registry, multidisciplinary approach, single centre. MATERIAL AND METHOD: All DS patients at QSNICH with parental signed consent were enrolled in the registry. The study was conducted for 5 years starting from May 2007 to April 2012. All patients were followed-up according to schedule modified from American Academic of Pediatrics (AAP) health supervision guideline. Standard treatment was given to all those children with diagnosis of CHD and/or other associated diseases. RESULTS: Four hundred and two cases of DS were enrolled. Two cases were excluded due to the parental inconvenience. The mode and mean age of the patients at registration were 1 and 7 months (1-62). Two hundred and seventy-one cases had an initial echocardiographic diagnosis of CHD, which included 91 of Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), 49 of Ventricular septal defect (VSD), 34 of AVSD, 34 of secondum Atrial septal defect (ASD), 6 of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), 2 of Coractation of Aorta (CoA), 11 of other CHD and 44 of combined lesions. During the follow-up period, spontaneous closure of PDA, VSD and ASD occurred in 46, 12 and 15 cases, respectively. After the exclusion of those who had spontaneous closure, the prevalence rate of CHD in DS was 49.8%. VSD was the most common lesion, slightly more than PDA. Ninety-eight cases underwent cardiac surgery; including 39 of associated VSD, 24 of AVSD, 26 of PDA, 3 of TOF, 4 of CoA/AA repaired, one each of Cor triatriatum and primum ASD. Twelve cases had catheter interventions, including PDA occlusion (10 cases), and 1 case of balloon dilatation of re-CoA and coils embolization of isolated major aorto-pulmonary collateral artery. Seven cases were lost at follow-up. By using the hospital information and National Health Security Office (NHSO) database, 47 infants died during the follow-up period. The causes of death were immediate post cardiac surgery in 10 cases (AVSD in 9, VSD in 1) and not associated with surgery in 37 cases including CHF in 8, pneumonia in 7, leukemia in 4, airway disease in 3, others 7 and unknown 8 cases. The overall survival at 1 and 5 years of age were 96% and 86%, respectively. DS with CHD had a significantly lower survival rate than those without CHD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: According to this study, the prevalence rate of CHD in DS was high. VSD was the most common lesion and has better prognosis than AVSD. The main cause of death was a cardiac problem. Follow-up patients by using modified AAP guideline and standard treatment can improve their overall survival.","['Layangool, Thanarat', 'Sangtawesin, Chaisit', 'Kirawittaya, Tawatchai', 'Prompan, Worakan', 'Prachasilchai, Pimpak', 'Pechdamrongsakul, Amornrat']","['Layangool T', 'Sangtawesin C', 'Kirawittaya T', 'Prompan W', 'Prachasilchai P', 'Pechdamrongsakul A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,['Partial atrioventricular canal'],IM,"['Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/*complications/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Heart Septal Defects, Atrial/complications', 'Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular/complications/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tetralogy of Fallot/complications', 'Thailand']",2014/11/14 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/11/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2014 Jun;97 Suppl 6:S108-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Seventy-six pediatric patients with newly diagnosed with ALL, who were treated in Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health using the national protocols during March 2006 and February 2008, were enrolled. The national protocols were sub-classified by clinical risk factors and morphology of leukemic cells of the patients at initial presentation into 3 groups as standard risk (ALL-01-05), high-risk (ALL-02-05), and mature B-ALL or L3 (NHL-04-06) protocol. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were determined by using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: The overall survival rate of ALL patients treated using the national protocols was 83.85% (88.06% in standard group, 82.01% in high-risk group, and 75% in L3 protocol). The mortality rate and event-free survival of ALL patients was 13.33% and 72.50%, respectively.

METHODS: Observational case report of a 20-year-old man with myeloid acute leukemia who presented a spontaneous resolution of a premacular hemorrhage, which was demonstrated by OCT. During the 12-month follow-up, periodic ophthalmologic and OCT examinations were performed. RESULTS: A premacular hemorrhage was revealed in fundus examination, and spectral-domain OCT demonstrated a highly hyperreflective band just above the premacular hemorrhage consistent with the ILM. At 6-month follow-up, the macula was free of blood. The OCT scans after spontaneous resolution of the hemorrhage showed a thickened hyperreflective membrane (ILM) and a prominent hyporeflective premacular cavity. Six months later, this premacular cavity had resolved. CONCLUSION: These late OCT findings in sub-ILM hemorrhage have not been described in spontaneous evolution and confirm the sub-ILM location of a premacular hemorrhage.","['Rey, Amanda', 'Adan, Alfredo', 'Llorenc, Victor', 'Pelegrin, Laura', 'Mesquida, Marina']","['Rey A', 'Adan A', 'Llorenc V', 'Pelegrin L', 'Mesquida M']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universidad de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,,,,2013/07/01 00:00,2013/07/01 00:01,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/ICB.0b013e31828eefbd [doi]', '01271216-201300730-00024 [pii]']",ppublish,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2013 Summer;7(3):276-7. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0b013e31828eefbd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case of ischemic maculopathy associated with imatinib mesylate therapy is reported. METHODS: A 62-year-old woman with a 16-year history of CML was treated with imatinib mesylate, initially at a daily dose of 400 mg that was decreased to 300 mg due to systemic side effects. Several weeks after beginning imatinib mesylate therapy, she developed blurred vision (greater in the left eye than in the right eye). RESULTS: Fundus examination of both eyes revealed retinal telangiectasia with intraretinal hemorrhages and perifoveal retinal telangiectasia. Fluorescein angiography showed macular ischemia (greater in the left eye than in the right eye). Late perifoveal leakage was present surrounding the macular ischemic zone. Visual acuity was reduced to 20/30 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye, which did not improve over 10 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate may be associated with ischemic maculopathy that can severely compromise vision. It may be necessary for patients receiving this therapy to be monitored for associated visual symptoms and funduscopic abnormalities.","['Roth, Daniel B', 'Akbari, Sara', 'Rothstein, Anna']","['Roth DB', 'Akbari S', 'Rothstein A']","['From the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,,,,2009/04/01 00:00,2009/04/01 00:01,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/ICB.0b013e318177f9d7 [doi]', '01271216-200900320-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2009 Spring;3(2):161-4. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0b013e318177f9d7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This flavonoid induced the phosphorylation of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and cell death was attenuated by inhibition of c-jun N-terminal kinases/stress activated protein kinases.

RESULTS: A 35-year-old white woman presented with acute visual loss in her left eye. She had no systemic or ophthalmological medical history. Slit-lamp examination was normal in both eyes. Fundus examination of the left eye showed not only multiple retinal hemorrhages but also a diffuse serous retinal detachment affecting the nasal aspect of the retina and the posterior pole. The leukocyte count was 124,000/mm (99% blasts), and the Philadelphia chromosome was positive, an abnormality that is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSION: Serous retinal detachment is an uncommon feature among leukemias. Chronic myelogenous leukemia may remain asymptomatic until a blastic phase occurs.

Caspofungin is a new antifungal agent effective in the treatment of invasive candidiasis. We report a case of candidal endophthalmitis that responded adequately to caspofungin. METHODS: A 24-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia presented with vision loss in both eyes. Visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and counting fingers in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed multiple, premacular, vitreous, pearl stringshaped condensations in the right eye and a subretinal abscess in the left eye. Treatment with 50 mg of intravenous caspofungin once daily was started. RESULTS: After 1 month, inflammation in both eyes had decreased, although the left eye developed macular scarring. Medication at discharge was intravenous caspofungin once daily for another 6 weeks. Nine months after presentation, the patient had residual vitreous condensations in the premacular region of the right eye with visual acuity of 20/25 and severe macular scarring in the left eye with visual acuity of 20/100. CONCLUSION: This case adds support for the use of caspofungin as monotherapy for candidal endophthalmitis.

CONCLUSION: Given the time of onset of the patient's visual symptoms with associated chorioretinopathy, his concurrent systemic manifestations of DS, along with his concurrent systemic, and ocular response to treatment, we speculate that this is the first reported occurrence of ATRA-associated chorioretinopathy in a patient with ATRA DS.","['Levasseur, Steve D', 'Tantiworawik, Adisak', 'Lambert Maberley, David A']","['Levasseur SD', 'Tantiworawik A', 'Lambert Maberley DA']","['*Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada daggerDepartment of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada double daggerDepartment of Medicine, Maharaj nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,,,,2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/ICB.0b013e3182618d6c [doi]', '01271216-201300710-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2013 Winter;7(1):46-9. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0b013e3182618d6c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus is the etiological agent of debilitating and fatal diseases, for which there is currently no long-term cure. In the majority of cases of leukemia caused by HTLV-1, only a single viral gene, hbz, and its cognate protein, HBZ, are expressed and their importance is increasingly being recognized in the development of HTLV-1-associated disease. We hypothesized that HBZ, like other HTLV-1 proteins, has properties and functions regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that affect specific signaling pathways important for disease development. To date, PTM of HBZ has not been described. We used an affinity-tagged protein and mass spectrometry method to identify seven modifications of HBZ for the first time. We examined how these PTMs affected the ability of HBZ to modulate several pathways, as measured using luciferase reporter assays. Herein, we report that none of the identified PTMs affected HBZ stability or its regulation of tested pathways.","['Dissinger, Nathan', 'Shkriabai, Nikoloz', 'Hess, Sonja', 'Al-Saleem, Jacob', 'Kvaratskhelia, Mamuka', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Dissinger N', 'Shkriabai N', 'Hess S', 'Al-Saleem J', 'Kvaratskhelia M', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America; Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America; College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus Ohio, United States of America.', 'Proteome Exploration Laboratory, Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, United States of America.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America; Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America; College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus Ohio, United States of America.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America; Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America; Comprehensive Cancer Center and Solove Research Institute, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America; Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141112,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0112762 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-28861 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 12;9(11):e112762. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0112762. eCollection 2014.,,,"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4229220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We measured CD200 expression levels in 505 peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and lymphoid tissue biopsy specimens, including 364 cases positive for B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. RESULTS: CD200 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases was as bright as or brighter than normal PB B cells in nearly all cases, while mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cases were usually dim or negative. However, rare MCL cases (about 5%) were moderately bright for CD200. Marginal zone lymphomas varied by subtype, with nodal cases brighter, splenic cases dimmer, and extranodal cases heterogeneous for CD200 expression. Follicular lymphoma (FL) cells were brighter for CD200 in BM specimens than in lymph nodes. In some BM specimens, dim CD200 could distinguish FL cells from background hematogones. Large B-cell lymphomas of the non-germinal center type tended to be brighter for CD200 than those of the germinal center type, while Burkitt lymphomas were negative.

The lineage-specific marker criteria have also changed for a diagnosis of MPAL. The goal of this study was to characterize clinical significance of this new group. METHODS: Sixty-one patients diagnosed with MPAL using either European Group for the Immunological Classification of Leukaemias (EGIL) criteria or 2008 WHO criteria were included in this study. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (26%) diagnosed with acute biphenotypic leukemia using EGIL criteria did not fulfill 2008 WHO criteria for MPAL. Cytogenetic data were available for 32 patients, and the most common abnormality was t(9;22) (five of 32 cases). Clinical outcome data suggested that younger patients with MPAL (</=21 years) had better overall survival (OS) in both the EGIL and WHO groups (EGIL, P = .0403; WHO, P = .0601). Compared with 177 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MPAL patients had better OS (P = .0003) and progression-free survival (P = .0001). However, no difference in OS between MPAL and 387 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was present (P = .599). CONCLUSIONS: As defined by the 2008 WHO classification, fewer patients are now classified as having MPAL than with the EGIL criteria.

Certain stimuli, such as, interleukin-3 (IL-3) are known to stimulate proliferation and migration in vascular diseases. Meanwhile, microRNAs (miRs) have been revealed as critical modulators of various diseases in which miR-29b is known to regulate cell growth by targeting Mcl-1 and MMP2. However, roles of miR-29b in vascular smooth muscle cells remain almost unknown. We hypothesized that miR-29b may control the proliferation and migration processes induced by IL-3 stimulation by inhibiting its own specific targets in SMCs. MiR-29b significantly suppressed the proliferation and migration of SMCs through the inhibition of the signaling pathway related to Mcl-1 and MMP2. We also found that miR-29b expression levels significantly declined in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries and that the overexpression of miR-29b by local oligonucleotide delivery can inhibit neointimal formation. Consistent with the critical role of miR-29b in vitro, we observed down-regulated expression levels of Mcl-1 and MMP2 from the neointimal region. These results indicate that miR-29b suppressed the proliferation and migration of SMCs, possibly through the inhibition of Mcl-1 and MMP2, and suggest that miR-29b may serve as a useful therapeutic tool to treat cardiovascular diseases such as, atherosclerosis and restenosis.","['Lee, Jiyun', 'Lim, Soyeon', 'Song, Byeong-Wook', 'Cha, Min-Ji', 'Ham, Onju', 'Lee, Se-Yeon', 'Lee, Changyoun', 'Park, Jun-Hee', 'Bae, Yoonjin', 'Seo, Hyang-Hee', 'Seung, Minji', 'Choi, Eunhyun', 'Hwang, Ki-Chul']","['Lee J', 'Lim S', 'Song BW', 'Cha MJ', 'Ham O', 'Lee SY', 'Lee C', 'Park JH', 'Bae Y', 'Seo HH', 'Seung M', 'Choi E', 'Hwang KC']","['Cardiovascular Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 120-752, Republic of Korea; Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 120-752, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MIRN29 microRNA, rat)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Mmp2 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carotid Artery Injuries/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*cytology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cytology/*physiology', 'Neointima/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2014/11/13 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.25011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2015 Apr;116(4):598-608. doi: 10.1002/jcb.25011.,['NOTNLM'],"['MIGRATION', 'MicroRNA-29b', 'PROLIFERATION', 'SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL']",,,,,,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is mediated by transcriptional events and driven by DNA hyper-methylation at promoter-associated CpG islands of the CBY1-encoding gene C22orf2. Moreover, CBY1 transcriptional induction proceeding from promoter de-methylation is a component of BCR-ABL1+ cell response to Imatinib (IM). Our study showed that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) has a central role in the hyper-methylation at the C22orf2 promoter. Further investigation in leukemic hematopoietic progenitors from IM-responsive and IM-resistant CML patients at diagnosis failed to demonstrate any correlation between DNMT1-driven hyper-methylation of the C22orf2 promoter and response to IM. Notably, the response to IM was neither predicted by DNMT1-driven hyper-methylation of BCL2-like11 at diagnosis. In conclusion, the hypermethylation of C22orf2 and BCL2-like11 promoters proceeding from DNMT1 is a crucial component of their reduced expression, but it is not directly involved in CML resistance to IM. It might rather contribute to the disease evolution towards a drug-resistant phenotype in more advanced phases or blast crisis.","['Leo, Elisa', 'Mancini, Manuela', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Santucci, Maria Alessandra', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Leo E', 'Mancini M', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Santucci MA', 'Martinelli G']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica a Sperimentale-DIMES, Istituto di Ematologia ""L. e A.

The fetal cell type that is transformed by ETV6-RUNX1 is not identified by such studies or by the analysis of early B-cell lineage phenotype of derived progeny. Ongoing, clonal immunoglobulin (IG) and cross-lineage T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements are features of B-cell precursor leukemia and commence at the pro-B-cell stage of normal B-cell lineage development. We reasoned that shared clonal rearrangements of IG or TCR genes by concordant ALL in twins would be informative about the fetal cell type in which clonal advantage is elicited by ETV6-RUNX1. Five pairs of twins were analyzed for all varieties of IG and TCR gene rearrangements. All pairs showed identical incomplete or complete variable-diversity-joining junctions coupled with substantial, subclonal and divergent rearrangements. This pattern was endorsed by single-cell genetic scrutiny in one twin pair. Our data suggest that the pre-leukemic initiating function of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion is associated with clonal expansion early in the fetal B-cell lineage.","['Alpar, D', 'Wren, D', 'Ermini, L', 'Mansur, M B', 'van Delft, F W', 'Bateman, C M', 'Titley, I', 'Kearney, L', 'Szczepanski, T', 'Gonzalez, D', 'Ford, A M', 'Potter, N E', 'Greaves, M']","['Alpar D', 'Wren D', 'Ermini L', 'Mansur MB', 'van Delft FW', 'Bateman CM', 'Titley I', 'Kearney L', 'Szczepanski T', 'Gonzalez D', 'Ford AM', 'Potter NE', 'Greaves M']","['1] Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK [2] Department of Pathology, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Haemato-Oncology Research Unit, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Geogenetics, Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen K, Denmark.', '1] Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK [2] Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Haemato-Oncology Research Unit, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research-London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141112,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetus', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014322 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.322 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):839-46. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.322.

If targeted therapy becomes reality, identification and monitoring of intraclonal plasma cell (PC) heterogeneity would become increasingly demanded. Here we investigated the kinetics of intraclonal heterogeneity among 116 MM patients using 23-marker multidimensional flow cytometry (MFC) and principal component analysis, at diagnosis and during minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. Distinct phenotypic subclones were observed in 35/116 (30%) newly diagnosed MM patients. In 10/35 patients, persistent MRD was detected after 9 induction cycles, and longitudinal comparison of patient-paired diagnostic vs MRD samples unraveled phenotypic clonal tiding after therapy in half (5/10) of the patients. After demonstrating selection of distinct phenotypic subsets by therapeutic pressure, we investigated whether distinct fluorescence-activated cell-sorted PC subclones had different clonogenic and cytogenetic profiles. In half (5/10) of the patients analyzed, distinct phenotypic subclones showed different clonogenic potential when co-cultured with stromal cells, and in 6/11 cases distinct phenotypic subclones displayed unique cytogenetic profiles by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, including selective del(17p13). Collectively, we unravel potential therapeutic selection of preexisting diagnostic phenotypic subclones during MRD monitoring; because phenotypically distinct PCs may show different clonogenic and cytogenetic profiles, identification and follow-up of unique phenotypic-genetic myeloma PC subclones may become relevant for tailored therapy.","['Paino, T', 'Paiva, B', 'Sayagues, J M', 'Mota, I',

In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the clonotypic rearranged IGHV gene is strongly associated with patient outcome. Correct determination of this parameter strictly depends on the comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the clonotypic rearranged IGHV gene with that of the closest germline counterpart. Consequently, changes in the reference directories could, in principle, affect the correct interpretation of the IGHV mutational status in CLL. To this end, we analyzed 8066 productive IG heavy chain (IGH) rearrangement sequences from our consortium both before and after the latest update of the IMGT/V-QUEST reference directory. Differences were identified in 405 cases (5 % of the cohort). In 291/405 sequences (71.9 %), changes concerned only the IGHV gene or allele name, whereas a change in the percent germline identity (%GI) was noted in 114/405 (28.1 %) sequences; in 50/114 (43.8 %) sequences, changes in the %GI led to a change in the mutational set. In conclusion, recent changes in the IMGT reference directories affected the interpretation of SHM in a sizeable number of IGH rearrangement sequences from CLL patients. This indicates that both physicians and researchers should consider a re-evaluation of IG sequence data, especially for those IGH rearrangement sequences that, up to date, have a GI close to 98 %, where caution is warranted.","['Xochelli, Aliki', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Kavakiotis, Ioannis', 'Minga, Evangelia', 'Sutton, Lesley Ann', 'Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Chouvarda, Ioanna', 'Giudicelli, Veronique', 'Vlahavas, Ioannis', 'Maglaveras, Nikos', 'Bonello, Lisa', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Panagiotidis, Panagiotis', 'Geisler, Christian', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Oscier, David', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Darzentas, Nikos', 'Davi, Fred', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Hadzidimitriou, Anastasia', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Lefranc, Marie-Paule', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Xochelli A', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Kavakiotis I', 'Minga E', 'Sutton LA', 'Baliakas P', 'Chouvarda I', 'Giudicelli V', 'Vlahavas I', 'Maglaveras N', 'Bonello L', 'Trentin L', 'Tedeschi A', 'Panagiotidis P', 'Geisler C', 'Langerak AW', 'Pospisilova S', 'Jelinek DF', 'Oscier D', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Darzentas N', 'Davi F', 'Ghia P', 'Rosenquist R', 'Hadzidimitriou A', 'Belessi C', 'Lefranc MP', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141112,United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mutation', '*Prognosis', 'Sequence Alignment']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00251-014-0812-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 2015 Jan;67(1):61-6. doi: 10.1007/s00251-014-0812-3.

The functional analysis is done via ontological briefing and candidate disease identification. We observed that the highly efficient-interlinked genes connected with adipoq are adipor2 and cdh13. Interestingly, the ontological aspect of adipor2 and cdh13 in the adipoq network reveal the fact that adipoq and adipor2 are involved mostly in glucose and lipid metabolic processes. The gene cdh13 indulge in cell adhesion process with adipoq and adipor2. Our computational gene web analysis also predicts potential candidate disease recognition, thus indicating the involvement of adipoq, adipor2, and cdh13 with not only with obesity but also with breast cancer, leukemia, renal cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer. The current study provides researchers a comprehensible layout of adipoq network, its functional strategies and candidate disease approach associated with adipoq network.","['Bag, Susmita', 'Anbarasu, Anand']","['Bag S', 'Anbarasu A']","['Medical and Biological Computing Laboratory, School of Biosciences and Technology, VIT University, Vellore, 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Medical and Biological Computing Laboratory, School of Biosciences and Technology, VIT University, Vellore, 632014, Tamil Nadu, India. aanand@vit.ac.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,"['0 (ADIPOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (H-cadherin)', '0 (Receptors, Adiponectin)']",IM,"['Adiponectin/*genetics', 'Cadherins/*genetics', 'Computational Biology', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Obesity/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptors, Adiponectin/*genetics']",2014/11/13 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12013-014-0367-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12013-014-0367-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2015 Apr;71(3):1445-56. doi: 10.1007/s12013-014-0367-9.,['NOTNLM'],"['Adipoq', 'Adipor2', 'Cdh13', 'Gene networks', 'Obesity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to evaluate CML patients' perceptions about the disease, their access to information regarding the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment, adverse effects and associations of these variables with patients' demographics, region and healthcare access. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective cross-sectional study among CML patients registered with the Brazilian Lymphoma and Leukemia Association (ABRALE). METHODS: CML patients receiving treatment through the public healthcare system were interviewed by telephone. RESULTS: Among 1,102 patients interviewed, the symptoms most frequently leading them to seek medical care were weakness or fatigue. One third were diagnosed by means of routine tests. The time that elapsed between first symptoms and seeking medical care was 42.28 +/- 154.21 days. Most patients had been tested at least once for Philadelphia chromosome, but 43.2% did not know the results. 64.8% had had polymerase chain reaction testing for the BCR/ABL gene every three months. 47% believed that CML could be controlled, but 33.1% believed that there was no treatment. About 24% reported occasionally stopping their medication. Imatinib was associated with nausea, cramps and muscle pain. Self-reported treatment adherence was significantly associated with normalized blood count, and positively associated with imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of information or understanding about disease monitoring tools among Brazilian CML patients; they are diagnosed quickly and have good access to treatment. Correct comprehension of CML control tools is impaired in Brazilian patients.","['Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Souza, Carmino de', 'Cornacchioni, Ana Lucia', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Tabak, Daniel', 'Spector, Nelson', 'Steagall, Merula']","['Hamerschlak N', 'Souza Cd', 'Cornacchioni AL', 'Pasquini R', 'Tabak D', 'Spector N', 'Steagall M']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Internal Medicine, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Tratamento do Cancer Infantil, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Internal Medicine, Universidade Federal do Parana, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro de Tratamento Oncologico, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Associacao Brasileira de Linfoma e Leucemia, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141107,Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Perception', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/13 06:00,2016/07/02 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1516-31802014005001306 [pii]', '10.1590/1516-3180.2014.0001306 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2015 Nov-Dec;133(6):471-9. doi: 10.1590/1516-3180.2014.0001306.

Thirty to 40 % of patients do not respond. Defects in apoptotic machinery lead to therapy resistance; however, to date, no study quantitatively assessed whether B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-dependent regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis, effector caspase activation downstream of mitochondria or a combination of both predicts patient responses. In a cohort of 20 rectal cancer patients, we performed protein profiling of tumour tissue and employed validated ordinary differential equation-based systems models of apoptosis signalling to calculate the ability of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Model outputs were compared to clinical responses. Systems modelling of BCL2-signalling predicted patients in the poor response group (p = 0.0049). Systems modelling also demonstrated that rectal cancers depended on BCL2 rather than B cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL(X)L) or myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) for survival, suggesting that poor responders may benefit from therapy with selective BCL2 antagonists. Dynamic modelling of effector caspase activation could not stratify patients with poor response and did not further improve predictive power. We deliver a powerful patient stratification tool identifying patients who will likely not benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and should be prioritised for surgical resection or treatment with BCL2 antagonists. KEY MESSAGES: Modelling BCL2-family proteins identifies patients unresponsive to therapy. Caspase activation downstream of mitochondria cannot identify these patients. Rectal tumours of poor responders are BCL2- but not BCL-XL-dependent. DR_MOMP allows clinicians to identify patients who would not benefit from therapy. DR_MOMP is also a useful patient stratification tool for BCL2 antagonists.","['Flanagan, L', 'Lindner, A U', 'de Chaumont, C', 'Kehoe, J', 'Fay, J', 'Bacon, O', 'Toomey, S', 'Huber, H J', 'Hennessy, B T', 'Kay, E W', 'McNamara, D A', 'Prehn, J H M']","['Flanagan L', 'Lindner AU', 'de Chaumont C', 'Kehoe J', 'Fay J', 'Bacon O', 'Toomey S', 'Huber HJ', 'Hennessy BT', 'Kay EW', 'McNamara DA', 'Prehn JH']","['Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141113,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rectal Neoplasms/*metabolism/therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/11/13 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00109-014-1221-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2015 Mar;93(3):315-26. doi: 10.1007/s00109-014-1221-7.

This qualitative study was based on analysis of narratives by six patients 23 to 62 years of age who were users of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) and patients at a referral hospital for hematological care in Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil. The results reveal the experience of disruption in three categories: (1) the meanings of illness and CML as life-threatening, (2) physical and social disruption and stigmatizing experiences, and (3) the ""before-and-after"" perception of CML, focusing on changes in self, social relations, and daily life. The article concludes that the biographical, social, and health-system impacts (considering the cost of medication) update and extend issues such as access to treatment and confronting certainty and uncertainty, where patients struggle to draw on their everyday knowledge to deal with what is ""known"" about CML.","['Lopez, Yeimi Alexandra Alzate', 'Trad, Leny Alves Bonfim']","['Lopez YA', 'Trad LA']",,['por'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Brazil,Cad Saude Publica,Cadernos de saude publica,8901573,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*psychology', '*Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Qualitative Research']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/04/10 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2013/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0102-311X2014001002199 [pii]', '10.1590/0102-311x00171613 [doi]']",ppublish,Cad Saude Publica. 2014 Oct;30(10):2199-208. doi: 10.1590/0102-311x00171613.,,,,,,"""Antes e depois da LMC"": experiencias e dimensoes da leucemia mieloide cronica como uma ruptura biografica.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The novel NEDDylation inhibitor MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has demonstrated significant preclinical antileukemic activity and preliminary efficacy in patients with AML in a phase I trial. On the basis of its antimyeloid and DNA-damaging properties, we investigated the ability of MLN4924 to augment conventional cytarabine (ara-C) therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of MLN4924/ara-C on viability, clonogenic survival, apoptosis, DNA damage, and relevant pharmacodynamic targets were determined. The efficacy and pharmacodynamics of MLN4924/ara-C were assessed in an AML xenograft model. RESULTS: Cotreatment of AML cell lines and primary patient specimens with MLN4924 and ara-C led to diminished clonogenic survival, increased apoptosis, and synergistic levels of DNA damage. RNAi demonstrated that stabilization of CDT-1, an event previously shown to mediate the DNA-damaging effects of MLN4924, was not a key regulator of sensitivity to the MLN4924/ara-C combination. Global metabolic profiling revealed that MLN4924 disrupts nucleotide metabolism and depletes intracellular nucleotide pools in AML cells. Subsequent experiments showed that MLN4924 promoted increased incorporation of ara-C into the DNA of AML cells. This effect as well as the therapeutic benefit of the MLN4924/ara-C combination was antagonized by supplementation with the nucleotide building block ribose. Coadministration of MLN4924 and ara-C to mice bearing FLT3-ITD(+) AML xenografts stably inhibited disease progression and increased DNA damage in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide strong rationale for clinical investigation of the MLN4924/ara-C combination and establish a new link between therapeutic inhibition of NEDDylation and alterations in nucleotide metabolism.

Recently, altered expression of certain miRNAs (miRs) have been described in ALL with potential effect on prognosis. Presence of certain miRs (miRNA-16, -21, -24, -29b, -128b, -142-3p, -155, -223) was characterized in human lymphoma and leukemia cells by real-time PCR. Expression of miRs in pediatric ALL patients (n = 24) was measured before chemotherapy, at conventional response checkpoints and at relapse. Correlation between altered miR expression and response to prednisolone at day 8 of therapy and long term prognosis was statistically analysed. Overexpression of ""oncomiR/inflammamiR""-21 - which is characteristic in different tumors-was missing in human ALL cells. However, higher expression of miR-128b and lower expression of miR-223 is generally characteristic for human ALL cell lines and ALL cells isolated from pediatric patients. Correlation was shown between miR-128b expression and prognosis, prednisolone response and survival data in childhood ALL. Expression of miR-128b and miR-223-both are leukemia specific-changed in parallel with percentage of bone marrow blasts in remission and during relapse. Therefore, we suggest that overexpression of miR-128b and downregulation of miR-223 shows a significant correlation with treatment response and prognosis in childhood ALL.","['Nemes, Karolina', 'Csoka, Monika', 'Nagy, Noemi', 'Mark, Agnes', 'Varadi, Zsofia', 'Danko, Titanilla', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Kopper, Laszlo', 'Sebestyen, Anna']","['Nemes K', 'Csoka M', 'Nagy N', 'Mark A', 'Varadi Z', 'Danko T', 'Kovacs G', 'Kopper L', 'Sebestyen A']","['2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, 1094, Tuzolto u. 7-9., Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141112,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/11/13 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12253-014-9861-z [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2015 Jul;21(3):597-604. doi: 10.1007/s12253-014-9861-z.

The role of FC in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) is unknown. We hypothesized that finding aberrant cells with FC in CP-CML may predict early blast-phase (BP) transformation. METHODS: Results for FC performed at the time of diagnosis for adult and pediatric patients with CP-CML who were referred to our institution were reviewed, and they were correlated with outcomes. RESULTS: FC was performed at the time of diagnosis for 110 of 233 patients (47%) with CP-CML. Aberrant populations, representing a median of 2% (range, 0.3%-15%), were detected with FC in 30% of patients (33 of 110): 2 of these 33 patients expressed lymphoid markers, and 31 expressed aberrant myeloid markers. Patients received imatinib (85%), dasatinib (12%), or nilotinib (3%) as their first-line treatment. With a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 2-113 months), chronic myeloid leukemia transformed to BP in 5 of the 33 patients. The 2 patients with lymphoid markers and the 3 of 31 patients with aberrant myeloid markers experienced a transformation to lymphoid BP at a median of 11 months (range, 4-72 months) after the initiation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Although both cases with detectable lymphoid markers rapidly progressed to lymphoid BP, the positive predictive value of BP transformation by the detection of myeloid aberrant cells with FC was only 10% (3 of 31). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to aberrant myeloid markers, the detection of lymphoid markers by FC at the time of the diagnosis of CP-CML appears to be associated with early progression to lymphoid BP.","['El Rassi, Fuad', 'Bergsagel, John D', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Gaddh, Manila', 'Jillella, Anand', 'Kota, Vamsi', 'Heffner, Leonard T', 'Winton, Elliott F', 'Khoury, Hanna Jean']","['El Rassi F', 'Bergsagel JD', 'Arellano M', 'Gaddh M', 'Jillella A', 'Kota V', 'Heffner LT', 'Winton EF', 'Khoury HJ']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141111,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29142 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Mar 15;121(6):872-5. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29142.

Relapsed disease is the major cause of treatment failure, especially when SCT is given in the setting of advanced disease. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be given after transplantation prophylactically or after the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) to reduce the relapse risk. METHODS: Posttransplant nilotinib was started after the achievement of sustained engraftment and the resolution of transplant-related toxicities. Nilotinib was continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with advanced CML (n = 15) or Ph(+) ALL (n = 7) underwent SCT with human leukocyte antigen-matched siblings (n = 11), unrelated donors (n = 7), or alternative donors (n = 4). Sixteen patients were given prophylactic nilotinib maintenance, which was started at a median of 38 days after transplantation. Six patients stopped the treatment because of toxicities (mostly gastrointestinal and hepatic). After nilotinib maintenance, 11 patients achieved (n = 9) or maintained (n = 2) a complete molecular response (CMR), and only 1 of them later relapsed. Four of the 5 patients not achieving CMR relapsed. At a median follow-up of 46 months, 9 patients were alive, and 13 had died. The 2-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-75%) and 45% (95% CI, 25%-66%), respectively. Among the 16 nilotinib recipients, the rates were 69% (95% CI, 46%-92%) and 56% (95% CI, 32%-81%), respectively. The 2-year nonrelapse mortality and relapse rates for all patients were 32% (95% CI, 17%-58%) and 23% (95% CI, 11%-49%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib is relatively safe and effective prophylactic therapy for the prevention of relapse after SCT. It may control MRD and convert patients to CMR, which is associated with prolonged survival. These observations merit further study in larger scale studies.","['Shimoni, Avichai', 'Volchek, Yulia', 'Koren-Michowitz, Maya', 'Varda-Bloom, Nira', 'Somech, Raz', 'Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shimoni A', 'Volchek Y', 'Koren-Michowitz M', 'Varda-Bloom N', 'Somech R', 'Shem-Tov N', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Nagler A']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141111,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29141 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Mar 15;121(6):863-71. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29141.

BCR signaling, either constitutively or following antigen binding, leads to activation of several downstream pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation and migration. The efficacy observed in studies of the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, confirms that BCR signaling is critical for the growth of B-cell malignancies. Ibrutinib characteristically induces redistribution of malignant B cells from tissues into the peripheral blood and rapid resolution of adenopathy. Furthermore, ibrutinib therapy results in normalization of lymphocyte counts and improvement in cytopenias. Ibrutinib has been shown to have an excellent safety profile and does not cause myelosuppression. Early data from combination studies of ibrutinib with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have shown more rapid responses compared to those seen with ibrutinib monotherapy. Current data strongly support continued clinical evaluation of ibrutinib in B-cell malignancies.","['Badar, Talha', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Wierda, William G', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Badar T', 'Burger JA', 'Wierda WG', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/epidemiology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2014.977862 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2014 Dec;7(6):705-17. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2014.977862.,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor signaling', 'Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'PCI-32765', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4811630,['NIHMS728602'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, MLL gene amplification in AML/MDS remains poorly characterized. Here, we report a series of 21 patients with myeloid neoplasms associated with MLL gene amplification from 1 institution. This series included 13 men and 8 women, with a median age of 64 years. Eleven patients presented as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, 6 as therapy-related AML, and 4 as therapy-related MDS. All patients had a highly complex karyotype, including frequent -5/del(5q), -18, and -17/del(17p) abnormalities; 16 patients were hypodiploid. TP53 mutations were detected in all 12 patients tested, and 3 patients showed TP53 mutation before MLL amplification. Morphologically, the leukemic cells frequently showed cytoplasmic vacuoles, bilobed nuclei, and were associated with background dyspoiesis. Immunophenotypically, 15 patients had a myeloid and 4 had myelomonocytic immunophenotype. Laboratory coagulopathies were common; 7 patients developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and 3 died of intracranial bleeding. All patients were refractory to therapy; the median overall survival was 1 month, after MLL gene amplification was detected. We concluded that AML/MDS with MLL gene amplification is likely a subset of therapy-related AML/MDS or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, associated with distinct clinicopathological features, frequent disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, a highly complex karyotype, TP53 deletion/mutation, and an aggressive clinical course.","['Tang, Guilin', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Zhang, Liping', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Huh, Yang O', 'Muzzafar, Tariq', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Tang G', 'DiNardo C', 'Zhang L', 'Ravandi F', 'Khoury JD', 'Huh YO', 'Muzzafar T', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wang SA', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Rates of disclosure of CHAs are variable and may be facilitated by patient-centered communication. METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted in 2003-2004 examined a population-based sample of leukemia, colorectal, and bladder cancer survivors (n=623) who were 2 to 5 years after their diagnosis. A subset of participants who reported using CHAs (n=196) was analyzed with multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between patients' perceptions of their physician's patient-centered communication (ie, information exchange, affective behavior, knowledge of patients as persons) and patients' disclosure of CHA use to their physician with adjustments for physician, patient, and patient-physician relationship factors. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of the full sample used CHAs, and 47.6% of CHA users disclosed their use to their physicians. Disclosure was significantly associated with patient-centered communication even with adjustments for hypothesized covariates (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.71). Perceived physician knowledge of the patient as a person (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48) and information exchange (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.60) were the aspects of patient-centered communication that contributed to this association. The main reason for nondisclosure assessed in the survey was that survivors did not think that it was important to discuss CHAs (67.0%). A majority of physicians encouraged continued use of CHAs when they were disclosed (64.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Results support the idea that improving the overall patient centeredness of cancer follow-up care and improving the disclosure of CHA use are potentially synergistic clinical goals.","['Sohl, Stephanie J', 'Borowski, Laurel A', 'Kent, Erin E', 'Smith, Ashley Wilder', 'Oakley-Girvan, Ingrid', 'Rothman, Russell L', 'Arora, Neeraj K']","['Sohl SJ', 'Borowski LA', 'Kent EE', 'Smith AW', 'Oakley-Girvan I', 'Rothman RL', 'Arora NK']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141111,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Communication', 'Complementary Therapies/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy', '*Physician-Patient Relations', 'Physicians', '*Self Disclosure', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29138 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Mar 15;121(6):900-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29138.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an EWS-FLI1 transcriptional target; it is highly expressed in ES and exerts opposing effects, ranging from ES cell death to angiogenesis and cancer stem cell propagation. The functions of NPY are regulated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), a hypoxia-inducible enzyme that cleaves the peptide and activates its growth-promoting actions. The objective of this study was to determine the clinically relevant functions of NPY by identifying the associations between patients' ES phenotype and their NPY concentrations and DPP activity. METHODS: NPY concentrations and DPP activity were measured in serum samples from 223 patients with localized ES and 9 patients with metastatic ES provided by the Children's Oncology Group. RESULTS: Serum NPY levels were elevated in ES patients compared with the levels in a healthy control group and an osteosarcoma patient population, and the elevated levels were independent of EWS-ETS translocation type. Significantly higher NPY concentrations were detected in patients with ES who had tumors of pelvic and bone origin. A similar trend was observed in patients with metastatic ES. There was no effect of NPY on survival in patients with localized ES. DPP activity in sera from patients with ES did not differ significantly from that in healthy controls and patients with osteosarcoma. However, high DPP levels were associated with improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic NPY levels are elevated in patients with ES, and these high levels are associated with unfavorable disease features. DPPIV in serum samples from patients with ES is derived from nontumor sources, and its high activity is correlated with improved survival.","['Tilan, Jason U', 'Krailo, Mark', 'Barkauskas, Donald A', 'Galli, Susana', 'Mtaweh, Haifa', 'Long, Jessica', 'Wang, Hongkun', 'Hawkins, Kirsten', 'Lu, Congyi', 'Jeha, Dima', 'Izycka-Swieszewska, Ewa', 'Lawlor, Elizabeth R', 'Toretsky, Jeffrey A', 'Kitlinska, Joanna B']","['Tilan JU', 'Krailo M', 'Barkauskas DA', 'Galli S', 'Mtaweh H', 'Long J', 'Wang H', 'Hawkins K', 'Lu C', 'Jeha D', 'Izycka-Swieszewska E', 'Lawlor ER', 'Toretsky JA', 'Kitlinska JB']","['Department of Nursing, School of Nursing and Health Studies, Georgetown University, Washington, District of Columbia; Department of Human Science, School of Nursing and Health Studies, Georgetown University, Washington, District of Columbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141111,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (EWS-FLI fusion protein)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide Y)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/*blood/genetics/mortality', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*blood/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neuropeptide Y/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Osteosarcoma/blood/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS/*genetics', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide Y/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*blood/genetics/mortality', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29090 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Mar 1;121(5):697-707. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29090.

Loss of or methylation of the p15INK4B gene in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells enhances myeloid progenitor formation from common myeloid progenitors. Therefore, we examined the effects of overexpressed p15INK4B on proliferation and apoptosis of CML cells. Overexpression of p15INK4B inhibited the growth of K562 cells by downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D1 expression. Overexpression of p15INK4B also induced apoptosis of K562 cells by upregulating Bax expression and downregulating Bcl-2 expression. Overexpression of p15INK4B together with STI571 (imatinib) or BCR-ABL1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) also enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis induction of K562 cells. The enhanced effect was also mediated by reduction of cyclin D1 and CDK4 and regulation of Bax and Bcl-2. In conclusion, our study may provide new insights into the role of p15INK4B in CML and a potential therapeutic target for overcoming tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in CML.","['Xia, D Y', 'Liu, L', 'Hao, M W', 'Liu, Q', 'Chen, R A', 'Liang, Y M']","['Xia DY', 'Liu L', 'Hao MW', 'Liu Q', 'Chen RA', 'Liang YM']","[""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141014,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['S0100-879X2014001201096 [pii]'],ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2014 Dec;47(12):1096-101.

However, there are few data regarding the reproducibility of MDS with unilineage dysplasia. The revised International Prognostic Scoring System R-IPSS described two new morphological categories, distinguishing bone marrow (BM) blast cell count between 0-2 % and >2- < 5 %. This distinction is critical for establishing prognosis, but the reproducibility of this threshold is still not demonstrated. The objectives of our study were to explore the reliability of the 2008 WHO classification, regarding unilineage vs. multilineage dysplasia, by reviewing 110 cases previously diagnosed with MDS, and to study whether the threshold of </=2 % BM blasts is reproducible among different observers. We used the same methodology as in our previous paper [Font et al. (2013) Ann Hematol 92:19-24], by encouraging investigators to include patients with <5 % BM blasts. Samples were collected from 11 hospitals and were evaluated by 11 morphologists. Each observer evaluated 20 samples, and each sample was analyzed independently by two morphologists. Discordance was observed in 36/108 suitable cases (33 %, kappa test 0.503). Diagnosis of MDS with unilineage dysplasia (refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD), refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) or unclassifiable MDS) was assessed in 33 patients, by either of the two observers. We combined this series with the cases with RCUD or RARS included in our 2013 paper, thus obtaining 50 cases with unilineage dysplasia by at least one of the observers. The whole series showed very low agreement regarding RCUD (5/23, 21 %) and RARS (5/28, 18 %). Regarding BM blast count, the threshold of </=2 % was not reproducible (discordance rate 32/108 cases, kappa test 0.277). Our study shows that among MDS WHO 2008 categories, interobserver discordance seems to be high in cases with unilineage dysplasia. We also illustrate that the threshold of </=2 % BM blasts as settled by the R-IPSS may be not easy to reproduce by morphologists in real practice.","['Font, Patricia', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Soto, Carlos', 'Ricard, Pilar', 'Novas, Carolina Munoz-', 'Martin-Clavero, Estela', 'Lopez-Rubio, Montserrat', 'Garcia-Alonso, Luis', 'Callejas, Marta', 'Bermejo, Alfredo', 'Benavente, Celina', 'Ballesteros, Monica', 'Cedena, Teresa', 'Calbacho, Maria', 'Urbina, Raquel', 'Villarrubia, Jesus', 'Gil, Santiago', 'Bellon, Jose Maria', 'Diez-Martin, Jose Luis', 'Villegas, Ana']","['Font P', 'Loscertales J', 'Soto C', 'Ricard P', 'Novas CM', 'Martin-Clavero E', 'Lopez-Rubio M', 'Garcia-Alonso L', 'Callejas M', 'Bermejo A', 'Benavente C', 'Ballesteros M', 'Cedena T', 'Calbacho M', 'Urbina R', 'Villarrubia J', 'Gil S', 'Bellon JM', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Villegas A']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, C/ Doctor Esquerdo 46, 28007, Madrid, Spain, pfontlopez@yahoo.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141113,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Count/statistics & numerical data', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cytodiagnosis/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Observer Variation', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2014/11/13 06:00,2015/05/02 06:00,['2014/11/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2252-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94(4):565-73. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2252-4.

RESULTS: This novel multiplex RT-PCR method can specifically detect these six positive plasmids with known transcripts, and the sensitivities were up to 10 copies. In the diagnosis of clinical specimens, four chromosomal translocations, including seven transcripts, were actually specifically detected. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed multiplex RT-PCR system can be used to detect these four recurrent chromosomal translocations specifically and sensitively. It is novel, accurate, and time and cost effective in the detection of leukemia-specific chromosomal translocations. Assays with this new strategy will have a potential in detecting other chromosomal translocations in leukemias.","['Hu, Yingxi', 'Duan, Qianqian', 'Chen, Yan', 'Yao, Li', 'Chen, Zixing', 'Li, Kai', 'Sun, Wanping']","['Hu Y', 'Duan Q', 'Chen Y', 'Yao L', 'Chen Z', 'Li K', 'Sun W']","['1 Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University , Suzhou, China .']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2014.0243 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2014 Dec;18(12):810-9. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2014.0243.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the study was to determine if XMRV is present in 44 patients with beta-thalassemia major, 48 with sickle cell disease, and 89 volunteer blood donors. After RNA/ DNA extraction from plasma/buffy coat the samples were screened for XMRV sequences by conserved nested GAG primers. None of the RNA samples showed a positive result. Surprisingly, four DNA samples obtained from blood donors were positive for XMRV provirus. The subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sequences are identical to the positive control (murine leukemia retrovirus) and are probably consistent with laboratory contamination. XMRV infection (provirus and viral RNA) was absent in multiply transfused patients and volunteer blood donors. The positive result obtained from some blood donors probably reflects laboratory contamination. We believe that XMRV does not pose risk to blood transfusion.","['Slavov, Svetoslav Nanev', 'Otaguiri, Katia Kaori', 'Macedo, Mayra Dorigan', 'Rocha-Junior, Mauricio Cristiano', 'Silva-Pinto, Ana Cristina', 'Kashima, Simone', 'Covas, Dimas Tadeu']","['Slavov SN', 'Otaguiri KK', 'Macedo MD', 'Rocha-Junior MC', 'Silva-Pinto AC', 'Kashima S', 'Covas DT']","['Regional Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo-USP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141001,Italy,New Microbiol,The new microbiologica,9516291,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*virology', 'Animals', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Young Adult', 'beta-Thalassemia/*virology']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,New Microbiol. 2014 Oct;37(4):543-50.

After allo-SCT, their reconstitution in the peripheral blood (PB) to levels similar to those in healthy individuals tends to be slow. We investigate the age- and sex-dependant immune reconstitution of myeloid (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) in the PB of 45 children with leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (aged 1-17 years, median 10) after allo-SCT with regard to relapse, acute GVHD (aGVHD) and relapse-free survival. Low pDC/muL PB up to day 60 post SCT are associated with higher incidence of moderate or severe aGVHD (P=0.035), whereas high pDC/muL PB up to day 60 are associated with higher risk of relapse (P<0.001). The time-trend of DCs/muL PB for days 0-200 is a significant predictor of relapse-free survival for both mDCs (P<0.001) and pDCs (P=0.020). Jointly modelling DC reconstitution and complications improves on these simple criteria. Compared with BM, PBSC transplants tend to show slower mDC/pDC reconstitution (P=0.001, 0.031, respectively), but have no direct effect on relapse-free survival. These results suggest an important role for both mDCs and pDCs in the reconstituting immune system. The inclusion of mDCs and pDCs may improve existing models for complication prediction following allo-SCT.","['Elze, M C', 'Ciocarlie, O', 'Heinze, A', 'Kloess, S', 'Gardlowski, T', 'Esser, R', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Bader, P', 'Huenecke, S', 'Serban, M', 'Kohl, U', 'Hutton, J L']","['Elze MC', 'Ciocarlie O', 'Heinze A', 'Kloess S', 'Gardlowski T', 'Esser R', 'Klingebiel T', 'Bader P', 'Huenecke S', 'Serban M', 'Kohl U', 'Hutton JL']","['Department of Statistics, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.', '1] Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Integrated Research and Treatment Center Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany [2] Paediatrics Department, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Pediatrics Department, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Integrated Research and Treatment Center Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Integrated Research and Treatment Center Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Integrated Research and Treatment Center Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Pediatrics Department, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Pediatrics Department, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Pediatrics Department, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Paediatrics Department, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Integrated Research and Treatment Center Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141110,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/mortality/therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2014257 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2014.257 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 Feb;50(2):266-73. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2014.257.

Quantitative real-time PCR of insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel qrtPCR) is a much more sensitive method, which can be performed on peripheral blood. We studied the significance of low increases of recipient cells (0.1%) detected by indel qrtPCR in a cohort of 89 transplants. We did not observe relapse among the 32 patients with no IMC. Fifty-seven patients presented a first IMC, which was followed by four different scenarios: a decreasing MC (26 cases, no relapse), a stable MC (1 case, 1 relapse), a second IMC (24 cases, 15 relapse) or no control of chimerism (6 cases, 5 relapses). In multivariate analysis, detection of two successive IMCs was strongly associated with relapse (hazard ratio (HR): 9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.8-23; P<0.0001). Among the 57 patients who presented at least one IMC, 27 underwent immunomodulation (tapering of immunosuppression or donor lymphocyte injection), leading to a 1-year relapse rate of 15.7% vs 57.6% in the 30 other patients (P=0.0007).

To better define clinical and biological parameters determining postrelapse outcome, we studied 59 patients with CML relapsing after HLA-identical sibling allo-SCT between 1993 and 2008. Eighteen (30.5%) were transplanted in advanced phase and 41 (69.5%) in chronic phase. With a median follow-up from relapse of 7.9 years, 5-year post relapse survival (PRS) was 62%. Multivariate analysis found disease status at transplant, time to diagnosis of relapse from transplant and pretransplant tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use as significant factors associated with PRS. Analysis of BCR-ABL transcript expression in the hematopoietic progenitor compartment was performed in 36 patients (22 relapsed, 8 non-relapsed and 6 TKI alone controls). Patients with BCR-ABL expression in their early hematopoietic stem cell compartment (Lineage(-)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD90(+)) had worse survival irrespective of the disease status. We conclude that disease status remains the strongest clinical prognostic factor for PRS in CML following allo-SCT. The persistence of BCR-ABL expression in the progenitor cell compartment in some patients after SCT emphasizes the need to target CML-leukemia stem cells.","['Jain, Natasha A', 'Ito, Sawa', 'Tian, Xin', 'Kurlander, Roger', 'Battiwalla, Minoo', 'Lu, Kit', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Malkovska, Vera', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Le, Robert Q', 'Shenoy, Aarthi', 'Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Koklanaris, Eleftheria', 'Superata, Jeanine', 'Muranski, Pawel', 'Barrett, A John', 'Yong, Agnes S M']","['Jain NA', 'Ito S', 'Tian X', 'Kurlander R', 'Battiwalla M', 'Lu K', 'Savani BN', 'Malkovska V', 'Rezvani K', 'Le RQ', 'Shenoy A', 'Hourigan CS', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Koklanaris E', 'Superata J', 'Muranski P', 'Barrett AJ', 'Yong ASM']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Washington Cancer Institute, Medstar Washington Hospital Center, 110 Irving Street NW C2151, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20141110,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/bmt.2014.249 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 Feb;50(2):189-196. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2014.249.

However, clinical trials of several TKIs failed to prove efficacy. In this context, we investigated changes in MAPK signaling activity, downstream apoptotic regulators and changes in cell cycle distribution in different urothelial cancer cell lines (UCCs) upon treatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. None of the classical sorafenib targets (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/-receptor 2, VEGFR1/-R2; platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha/-receptor beta, PDGFR-alpha/-beta; c-KIT) was expressed at significant levels leaving RAF proteins as its likely molecular target. Low sorafenib concentrations paradoxically increased cell viability, whereas higher concentrations induced G1 arrest and eventually apoptosis. MAPK signaling remained partly active after sorafenib treatment, especially in T24 cells with an oncogenic HRAS mutation. AKT phosphorylation was increased, suggesting compensatory activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Sorafenib regularly down regulated the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) protein, but combinatorial treatment with ABT-737 targeting other B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins did not result in synergistic effects. In summary, efficacy of sorafenib in urothelial cancer cell lines appears hampered by limited effects on MAPK signaling, crosstalk with further cancer pathways and an anti-apoptotic state of UCCs. These observations may account for the lack of efficacy of sorafenib in clinical trials and should be considered more broadly in the development of signaling pathway inhibitors for drug therapy in urothelial carcinoma.","['Knievel, Judith', 'Schulz, Wolfgang A', 'Greife, Annemarie', 'Hader, Christiane', 'Lubke, Tobias', 'Schmitz, Ingo', 'Albers, Peter', 'Niegisch, Gunter']","['Knievel J', 'Schulz WA', 'Greife A', 'Hader C', 'Lubke T', 'Schmitz I', 'Albers P', 'Niegisch G']","['Department of Urology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstr. 5, Dusseldorf D-40225, Germany. judith.knievel@hhu.de.', 'Department of Urology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstr. 5, Dusseldorf D-40225, Germany. wolfgang.schulz@hhu.de.', 'Department of Urology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstr. 5, Dusseldorf D-40225, Germany. annemarie.koch@hhu.de.', 'Department of Urology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstr. 5, Dusseldorf D-40225, Germany. christiane.hader@hhu.de.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung, Inhoffenstr. 7, Braunschweig D-38124, Germany. tobias.luebke@helmholtz-hzi.de.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung, Inhoffenstr. 7, Braunschweig D-38124, Germany. ingo.schmitz@helmholtz-hzi.de.', 'Department of Urology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstr. 5, Dusseldorf D-40225, Germany. urologie@uni-duesseldorf.de.', 'Department of Urology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstr. 5, Dusseldorf D-40225, Germany. guenter.niegisch@hhu.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141107,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Urinary Bladder/drug effects/enzymology/*pathology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Urothelium/drug effects/pathology']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms151120500 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms151120500 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2014 Nov 7;15(11):20500-17. doi: 10.3390/ijms151120500.,,,,PMC4264180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence implicates miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Here we showed that miR-107 directly targeted MCL1 and activated ATR/Chk1 pathway to inhibit proliferation, migration and invasiveness of cervical cancer cells. Moreover, we found that MCL1 was frequently up-regulated in cervical cancer, and knockdown of MCL1 markedly inhibited cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas ectopic expression of MCL1 significantly enhances these properties. The restoration of MCL1 expression can counteract the effect of miR-107 on the cancer cells. Together, miR-107 is a new regulator of MCL1, and both miR-107 and MCL1 play important roles in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. We have therefore identified a mechanism for ATR/Chk1 pathway which involves an increase in miR-107 leading to a decrease in MCL1. Correspondingly, our results revealed that miR-107 affected ATR/Chk1 signalling and gene expression, and implicated miR-107 as a therapeutic target in human cervical cancer. We also demonstrated that taxol attenuated migration and invasion in cervical cancer cells by activating the miR-107, in which miR-107 play an important role in regulating the expression of MCL1. Elucidation of this discovered MCL1 was directly regulated by miR-107 will greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for cervical cancer and will provide an additional arm for the development of anticancer therapies.","['Zhou, Chengyan', 'Li, Gang', 'Zhou, Jingjing', 'Han, Na', 'Liu, Zhihui', 'Yin, Jun']","['Zhou C', 'Li G', 'Zhou J', 'Han N', 'Liu Z', 'Yin J']","['Development and Utilization Key Laboratory of Northeast Plant Materials, Key Laboratory of Northeast Authentic Materials Research and Development in Liaoning Province, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Wenhua Road 103, Shenhe District, Shenyang, 110016, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Baojian Road 157, Nangang District, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'Development and Utilization Key Laboratory of Northeast Plant Materials, Key Laboratory of Northeast Authentic Materials Research and Development in Liaoning Province, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Wenhua Road 103, Shenhe District, Shenyang, 110016, China.', 'Development and Utilization Key Laboratory of Northeast Plant Materials, Key Laboratory of Northeast Authentic Materials Research and Development in Liaoning Province, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Wenhua Road 103, Shenhe District, Shenyang, 110016, China.', 'Development and Utilization Key Laboratory of Northeast Plant Materials, Key Laboratory of Northeast Authentic Materials Research and Development in Liaoning Province, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Wenhua Road 103, Shenhe District, Shenyang, 110016, China.', 'Development and Utilization Key Laboratory of Northeast Plant Materials, Key Laboratory of Northeast Authentic Materials Research and Development in Liaoning Province, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Wenhua Road 103, Shenhe District, Shenyang, 110016, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141111,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN107 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/*pathology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111860 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-31289 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 11;9(11):e111860. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111860. eCollection 2014.,,,"['K99 AA023002/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 AA023002/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4227659,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Proviral Integration site of Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases are important mediators of cell survival. We aimed to determine the therapeutic value of PIM kinases because they are overexpressed in PTCL patients, T cell lines and primary tumoral T cells. PIM kinases were inhibited genetically (using small interfering and short hairpin RNAs) and pharmacologically (mainly with the pan-PIM inhibitor (PIMi) ETP-39010) in a panel of 8 PTCL cell lines. Effects on cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, key proteins and gene expression were evaluated. Individual inhibition of each of the PIM genes did not affect PTCL cell survival, partially because of a compensatory mechanism among the three PIM genes. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of all PIM kinases strongly induced apoptosis in all PTCL cell lines, without cell cycle arrest, in part through the induction of DNA damage. Therefore, pan-PIMi synergized with Cisplatin. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of PIM reduced primary tumoral T cell viability without affecting normal T cells ex vivo. Since anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) cell lines were the most sensitive to the pan-PIMi, we tested the simultaneous inhibition of ALK and PIM kinases and found a strong synergistic effect in ALK+ ALCL cell lines. Our findings suggest that PIM kinase inhibition could be of therapeutic value in a subset of PTCL, especially when combined with ALK inhibitors, and might be clinically beneficial in ALK+ ALCL.","['Martin-Sanchez, Esperanza', 'Odqvist, Lina', 'Rodriguez-Pinilla, Socorro M', 'Sanchez-Beato, Margarita', 'Roncador, Giovanna', 'Dominguez-Gonzalez, Beatriz', 'Blanco-Aparicio, Carmen', 'Garcia Collazo, Ana M', 'Cantalapiedra, Esther Gonzalez', 'Fernandez, Joaquin Pastor', 'Curiel del Olmo, Soraya', 'Pisonero, Helena', 'Madureira, Rebeca', 'Almaraz, Carmen', 'Mollejo, Manuela', 'Alves, F Javier', 'Menarguez, Javier', 'Gonzalez-Palacios, Fernando', 'Rodriguez-Peralto, Jose Luis', 'Ortiz-Romero, Pablo L', 'Real, Francisco X', 'Garcia, Juan F', 'Bischoff, James R', 'Piris, Miguel A']","['Martin-Sanchez E', 'Odqvist L', 'Rodriguez-Pinilla SM', 'Sanchez-Beato M', 'Roncador G', 'Dominguez-Gonzalez B', 'Blanco-Aparicio C', 'Garcia Collazo AM', 'Cantalapiedra EG', 'Fernandez JP', 'Curiel del Olmo S', 'Pisonero H', 'Madureira R', 'Almaraz C', 'Mollejo M', 'Alves FJ', 'Menarguez J', 'Gonzalez-Palacios F', 'Rodriguez-Peralto JL', 'Ortiz-Romero PL', 'Real FX', 'Garcia JF', 'Bischoff JR', 'Piris MA']","['Molecular Pathology Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain; Cancer Genomics Group, Marques de Valdecilla Research Institute (IDIVAL) & Pathology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Molecular Pathology Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Onco-hematology Area, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro - Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', 'Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Pathology Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Group, Marques de Valdecilla Research Institute (IDIVAL) & Pathology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Group, Marques de Valdecilla Research Institute (IDIVAL) & Pathology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Group, Marques de Valdecilla Research Institute (IDIVAL) & Pathology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Group, Marques de Valdecilla Research Institute (IDIVAL) & Pathology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, 12 de Octubre University Hospital, Medical School Universidad Complutense, Instituto i+12, Madrid, Spain.', 'Dermatology Department, 12 de Octubre University Hospital, Medical School Universidad Complutense, Instituto i+12, Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Pathology Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Translational Research Laboratory, M.

This recommendation is partly due to the severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia from which many patients suffer. The inability to perform activities of daily living restricts them, diminishes their quality of life and can influence medical therapy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of aerobic physical exercise for adults suffering from haematological malignancies. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 1) and MEDLINE (1950 to January 2014) as well as conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing an aerobic physical exercise intervention, intending to improve the oxygen system, in addition to standard care with standard care only for adults suffering from haematological malignancies. We also included studies that evaluated aerobic exercise in addition to strength training. We excluded studies that investigated the effect of training programmes that were composed of yoga, tai chi chuan, qigong or similar types of exercise. We also excluded studies exploring the influence of strength training without additive aerobic exercise. Additionally, we excluded studies assessing outcomes without any clinical impact. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events and 100-day survival, standardised mean differences for quality of life (QoL), fatigue, and physical performance, and mean differences for anthropometric measurements. MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategies identified 1518 potentially relevant references. Of these, we included nine RCTs involving 818 participants. The potential risk of bias in these trials is unclear, due to poor reporting.The majority of participants suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma, and six trials randomised people receiving stem cell transplantation. Mostly, the exercise intervention consisted of various walking intervention programmes with different duration and intensity levels.Our primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not analysed in any of the included trials, but three trials reported deceased participants during the course of the study or during the first 100 days. There is no evidence for a difference between participants exercising and those in the control group (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.47; P = 0.75; 3 trials, 269 participants, moderate quality of evidence).Four trials analysed the influence of exercise intervention on quality of life (QoL). Excluding one trial with serious baseline imbalances, physical exercise improves QoL (SMD 0.26; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.49; P = 0.03; 3 trials, 291 participants, low quality of evidence). This positive effect of exercise was also found in the subscales physical functioning (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.52; P = 0.0009; 4 trials, 422 participants, moderate quality of evidence) and depression (SMD 0.25; 95% CI -0.00 to 0.50; P = 0.05; 3 trials, 249 participants, low quality of evidence). However, there is no evidence for a difference between additional exercise and standard treatment for the subscale anxiety (SMD -0.18; 95% CI -0.64 to 0.28; P = 0.45; 3 trials, 249 participants, low quality of evidence). Seven trials (692 participants) evaluated fatigue. There is moderate quality of evidence that exercise improves fatigue (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.40; P = 0.003).Eight studies evaluated various aspects of physical performance (e.g. aerobic capacity, cardiovascular fitness), but none of them could be pooled in a meta-analysis. In seven trials there is a tendency or statistically significant effect favouring the exercise group (very low quality of evidence).Three trials (266 participants) investigated serious adverse events (SAEs) (e.g. bleeding, fever, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and infection), and one trial (122 participants) assessed adverse events (AEs). There is no evidence for a difference between arms in terms of SAEs (RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.96 to 2.18; P = 0.06) or AEs (RR 7.23; 95% CI 0.38 to 137.05; P = 0.19); both findings are based on low quality of evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for differences in mortality between the exercise and control groups. Physical exercise added to standard care can improve quality of life, especially physical functioning, depression and fatigue. Currently, there is inconclusive evidence regarding anxiety, physical performance, serious adverse events and adverse events.We need further trials with more participants and longer follow-up periods to evaluate the effects of exercise intervention for people suffering from haematological malignancies. Furthermore, we need trials with overall survival as the primary outcome to determine whether the suggested benefits will translate into a survival advantage. To enhance comparability of study data, development and implementation of core sets of measuring devices would be helpful.","['Bergenthal, Nils', 'Will, Andrea', 'Streckmann, Fiona', 'Wolkewitz, Klaus-Dieter', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Engert, Andreas', 'Elter, Thomas', 'Skoetz, Nicole']","['Bergenthal N', 'Will A', 'Streckmann F', 'Wolkewitz KD', 'Monsef I', 'Engert A', 'Elter T', 'Skoetz N']","['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany, 50924.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20141111,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,,IM,"['Adult', '*Exercise', 'Exercise Tolerance', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/mortality/*rehabilitation', 'Humans', 'Qigong', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Resistance Training', 'Tai Ji', 'Yoga']",2014/11/12 06:00,2014/12/31 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD009075.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 Nov 11;(11):CD009075. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009075.pub2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019 Jan 31;1:CD009075.

We aim to compare soluble mediator profiles in primary knee and posttraumatic wrist osteoarthritis. Based on the general faster progression rate of wrist osteoarthritis, we hypothesize a more inflammatory profile. METHODS: We collected synovial fluid from 20 primary osteoarthritic knee and 20 posttraumatic osteoarthritic wrist joints. 17 mediators were measured by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: chemokine ligand 5, interferon-gamma, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin-M, osteoprotegerin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13 and IL-17. RESULTS: TEN MEDIATORS WERE HIGHER IN POSTTRAUMATIC OSTEOARTHRITIC SYNOVIAL FLUID: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), IL-1alpha, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, oncostatin-M, interferon-gamma, chemokine ligand 5 and leukemia inhibitory factor (P<0.001). IL-1ss, IL-4, IL-7 were not detected, TNFalpha was not detected in knee osteoarthritic synovial fluid. IL-8, IL-13, osteoprotegerin and vascular endothelial growth factor levels did not differ between the synovial fluid types. CONCLUSIONS: In general wrist osteoarthritis seems characterized by a stronger inflammatory response than primary knee osteoarthritis. More pronounced inflammatory mediators might offer a paradigm for the faster progression of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Increase of specific mediators could form a possible target for future mediator modulating therapy in wrist osteoarthritis.","['Teunis, Teun', 'Beekhuizen, Michiel', 'Van Osch, Gerjo V M', 'Schuurman, Arnold H', 'Creemers, Laura B', 'van Minnen, L Paul']","['Teunis T', 'Beekhuizen M', 'Van Osch GV', 'Schuurman AH', 'Creemers LB', 'van Minnen LP']","['Teun Teunis MD, Arnold H.

RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to determine the effects of CH on the expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein in K562/ADR cells when CH was used alone and combined with SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, to explore the effects of CH on JNK pathway. Western blot analysis was used to determine the effects of CH on c-Jun protein expression and phosphorylation, to explore the regulating effects of CH on c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) proteins. Our results showed that the inhibitory effect of CH on MDR1 mRNA increased with the concentrations of CH (5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 muM) and the inhibitory effects of CH on MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein increased with the incubation time of CH (0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours). The inhibitory effect was weakened after CH combined with SP600125. The expressions of c-Jun and p-c-Jun proteins increased with the incubation time of CH (0, 6, 12, and 24 hours). These findings suggest that CH downregulated the expressions of MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein in a time and concentration manner; the mechanism may be mediated via activating c-Jun/JNK pathway.","['Han, Li', 'Wang, Yafeng', 'Guo, Xiaojuan', 'Zhou, Yubing', 'Zhang, Jingmin', 'Wang, Ning', 'Jiang, Jinhua', 'Ma, Fang', 'Wang, Qingduan']","['Han L', 'Wang Y', 'Guo X', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang J', 'Wang N', 'Jiang J', 'Ma F', 'Wang Q']","['Zhang Zhongjing College of Chinese Medicine, Nanyang Institute of Technology, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, China.', 'Zhang Zhongjing College of Chinese Medicine, Nanyang Institute of Technology, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, China ; Henan Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou Henan 450052, China.', 'Henan Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou Henan 450052, China.', 'Henan Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou Henan 450052, China.', 'Henan Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou Henan 450052, China.', 'Henan Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou Henan 450052, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20141016,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7592YJ0J6T (cepharanthine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Benzylisoquinolines/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/164391 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:164391. doi: 10.1155/2014/164391.

Multiple articles discuss the rare incidence and potential causes of second hematologic disorders arising after treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), leading to the theory of imatinib, the current treatment regimen for CML, as a possible trigger for the development of secondary neoplasms. Our case eliminates the possibility of imatinib as the sole cause since our patient received a diagnosis of simultaneous plasma cell myeloma, CML, and a Jak2 mutation positive myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) arising de novo, prior to any treatment. We will further investigate into alternative theories as potential causes for multiple hematopathologic disorders. Case Report. There are currently no reported cases with the diagnosis of simultaneous plasma cell myeloma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and Jak2 positive myeloproliferative disorder. We present a case of a 77-year-old male who was discovered to have these three concurring hematopathologic diagnoses. Our review of the literature includes a look at potential associations linking the three coexisting hematologic entities. Conclusion. The mechanism resulting in simultaneous malignancies is most likely multifactorial and potentially includes factors specific to the host, continuous stimulation of the immune system, previous chemotherapy or radiation, a potential common pluripotent stem cell, or, lastly, preexisting myeloma which may increase the susceptibility of additional malignancies.","['Maerki, J', 'Katava, G', 'Siegel, D', 'Silberberg, J', 'Bhattacharyya, P K']","['Maerki J', 'Katava G', 'Siegel D', 'Silberberg J', 'Bhattacharyya PK']","['Rutgers-NJMS, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Rutgers-NJMS, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ 07601, USA.', 'Regional Cancer Care Associates, Freehold, NJ 07728, USA.', 'Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ 07601, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141015,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2014/11/12 06:00,2014/11/12 06:01,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/738428 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2014;2014:738428. doi: 10.1155/2014/738428.

Autologous transplantation allows the administration of high-dose chemotherapy without prolonged bone marrow aplasia. In allogeneic transplantation, donor-derived stem cells provide alloimmunity that enables a graft-versus-tumor effect to eradicate residual disease and prevent relapse. The first allogeneic transplantation was performed by E. Donnall Thomas in 1957. Since then the field has evolved and expanded worldwide. New indications beside acute leukemia and aplastic anemia have been constantly explored and now include congenital disorders of the hematopoietic system, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disease. The use of matched unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and partially matched related donors has dramatically extended the availability of allogeneic transplantation. Transplant-related mortality has decreased due to improved supportive care, including better strategies to prevent severe infections and with the incorporation of reduced-intensity conditioning protocols that lowered the toxicity and allowed for transplantation in older patients. However, disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease remain the two major causes of mortality with unsatisfactory progress. Intense research aiming to improve adoptive immunotherapy and increase graft-versus-leukemia response while decreasing graft-versus-host response might bring the next breakthrough in allogeneic transplantation. Strategies of graft manipulation, tumor-associated antigen vaccinations, monoclonal antibodies, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy have already proved clinically efficient. In the following years, allogeneic transplantation is likely to become more complex, more individualized, and more efficient.","['Henig, Israel', 'Zuckerman, Tsila']","['Henig I', 'Zuckerman T']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel ; Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141029,Israel,Rambam Maimonides Med J,Rambam Maimonides medical journal,101538065,,,,2014/11/12 06:00,2014/11/12 06:01,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5041/RMMJ.10162 [doi]', 'rmmj-5-4-e0028 [pii]']",epublish,Rambam Maimonides Med J. 2014 Oct 29;5(4):e0028. doi: 10.5041/RMMJ.10162. eCollection 2014 Oct.,['NOTNLM'],"['Adoptive immunotherapy', 'alternative donor', 'conditioning', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'graft-versus-leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",,PMC4222417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of malignant cells with a sensitivity of 1 tumor cell in 10,000 cells (10(-4)), using the abovementioned sophisticated techniques, is the current cutoff for minimal residual disease (MRD). Tumor burdens lower than 10(-4) are defined as MRD-negative. Several studies in CLL have determined the achievement of MRD negativity as an independent favorable prognostic factor, leading to prolonged disease-free and overall survival, regardless of the treatment protocol or the presence of other pre-existing prognostic indicators.

The clinical utility of genetic data is anticipated to advance further with the adoption of deep sequencing and next-generation sequencing techniques. We herein suggest some future potential applications of sequential genetic data to identify pending deteriorations at time points which are the best for aggressive interventions such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether acute myocardial infarction triggers an inflammatory T-cell response that might lead to accelerated immunosenescence in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention were longitudinally studied within 3 months after reperfusion (Cohort A). In addition, 54 patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic myocardial infarction were analyzed in a cross-sectional study (Cohort B). Cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients demonstrated a greater fall in the concentration of terminally differentiated CD8 effector memory T cells (TEMRA) in peripheral blood during the first 30 minutes of reperfusion compared with cytomegalovirus-seronegative patients (-192 versus -63 cells/muL; P=0.008), correlating with the expression of programmed cell death-1 before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (r=0.8; P=0.0002). A significant proportion of TEMRA cells remained depleted for >/=3 months in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients. Using high-throughput 13-parameter flow cytometry and human leukocyte antigen class I cytomegalovirus-specific dextramers, we confirmed an acute and persistent depletion of terminally differentiated TEMRA and cytomegalovirus-specific CD8(+) cells in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients. Long-term reconstitution of the TEMRA pool in chronic cytomegalovirus-seropositive postmyocardial infarction patients was associated with signs of terminal differentiation including an increase in killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 and shorter telomere length in CD8(+) T cells (2225 versus 3397 bp; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention leads to acute loss of antigen-specific, terminally differentiated CD8 T cells, possibly through programmed cell death-1-dependent programmed cell death. Our results suggest that acute myocardial infarction and reperfusion accelerate immunosenescence in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients.","['Hoffmann, Jedrzej', 'Shmeleva, Evgeniya V', 'Boag, Stephen E', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Bagnall, Alan', 'Murali, Santosh', 'Dimmick, Ian', 'Pircher, Hanspeter', 'Martin-Ruiz, Carmen', 'Egred, Mohaned', 'Keavney, Bernard', 'von Zglinicki, Thomas', 'Das, Rajiv', 'Todryk, Stephen', 'Spyridopoulos, Ioakim']","['Hoffmann J', 'Shmeleva EV', 'Boag SE', 'Fiser K', 'Bagnall A', 'Murali S', 'Dimmick I', 'Pircher H', 'Martin-Ruiz C', 'Egred M', 'Keavney B', 'von Zglinicki T', 'Das R', 'Todryk S', 'Spyridopoulos I']","['From the Institute of Genetic Medicine (J.H., E.V.S., S.E.B., S.M., B.K., I.S.), Institute of Aging and Health (C.M.-R., T.v.Z.), and Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom (A.B., M.E., R.D., S.T.), Department of Cardiology, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom (A.B., M.E., R.D., I.S.);

Here, we identify putative direct Notch targets in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) embryonic tissue by chromatin precipitation using antibodies against the Notch partner RBPj. By ChIP-on-chip analysis of the precipitated DNA, we identified 701 promoter regions that were candidates to be regulated by Notch in the AGM. One of the most enriched regions corresponded to the Cdca7 gene, which was subsequently confirmed to recruit the RBPj factor but also Notch1 in AGM cells. We found that during embryonic hematopoietic development, expression of Cdca7 is restricted to the hematopoietic clusters of the aorta, and it is strongly up-regulated in the hemogenic population during human embryonic stem cell hematopoietic differentiation in a Notch-dependent manner. Down-regulation of Cdca7 mRNA in cultured AGM cells significantly induces hematopoietic differentiation and loss of the progenitor population. Finally, using loss-of-function experiments in zebrafish, we demonstrate that CDCA7 contributes to HSC emergence in vivo during embryonic development. Thus, our study identifies Cdca7 as an evolutionary conserved Notch target involved in HSC emergence.","['Guiu, Jordi', 'Bergen, Dylan J M', 'De Pater, Emma', 'Islam, Abul B M M K', 'Ayllon, Veronica', 'Gama-Norton, Leonor', 'Ruiz-Herguido, Cristina', 'Gonzalez, Jessica', 'Lopez-Bigas, Nuria', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Dzierzak, Elaine', 'Espinosa, Lluis', 'Bigas, Anna']","['Guiu J', 'Bergen DJ', 'De Pater E', 'Islam AB', 'Ayllon V', 'Gama-Norton L', 'Ruiz-Herguido C', 'Gonzalez J', 'Lopez-Bigas N', 'Menendez P', 'Dzierzak E', 'Espinosa L', 'Bigas A']","[""Program de Recerca en Cancer, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona, 08003 Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program de Recerca en Cancer, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona, 08003 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Erasmus MC Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Institute, Erasmus Medical Center, 3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Research Unit on Biomedical Informatics, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Pompeu Fabra University, 08003 Barcelona, Spain Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh.', 'Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research (Genyo), Pfizer-University of Granada-Andalusian Government, 18016 Granada, Spain.', ""Program de Recerca en Cancer, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona, 08003 Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program de Recerca en Cancer, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona, 08003 Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program de Recerca en Cancer, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona, 08003 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Research Unit on Biomedical Informatics, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Pompeu Fabra University, 08003 Barcelona, Spain Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Jose Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Cell Therapy Program, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Erasmus MC Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Institute, Erasmus Medical Center, 3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands.', ""Program de Recerca en Cancer, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona, 08003 Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program de Recerca en Cancer, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona, 08003 Barcelona, Spain abigas@imim.es.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141110,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CDCA7 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Rbpj protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/embryology/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/embryology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zebrafish/embryology/genetics']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20131857 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20131857 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2014 Nov 17;211(12):2411-23. doi: 10.1084/jem.20131857.

CD19 is homogenously expressed in B-precursor ALL and can be targeted by the investigational bispecific T cell-engager antibody blinatumomab. A phase II trial was performed to determine clinical activity in this patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL were treated with blinatumomab in cycles of 4-week continuous infusion followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval in a single-arm study with a dose-finding stage and an extension stage. The primary end point was complete remission (CR) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh). Major secondary end points included minimal residual disease (MRD) response, rate of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) realization, relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Median age was 32 years (range, 18 to 77 years). Twenty-five patients (69%) achieved a CR or CRh, with 88% of the responders achieving an MRD response. Median OS was 9.8 months (95% CI, 8.5 to 14.9), and median RFS was 7.6 months (95% CI, 4.5 to 9.5). Thirteen responders (52%) underwent HSCT after achieving a CR or CRh. The most frequent AE during treatment was pyrexia (grade 1 or 2, 75%; grade 3, 6%). In six patients with nervous system or psychiatric disorder AEs and in two patients with cytokine release syndrome, treatment had to be interrupted or discontinued. These medical events were resolved clinically. CONCLUSION: The data support further investigation of blinatumomab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL in a larger confirmatory study.","['Topp, Max S', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard', 'Klappers, Petra', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Neumann, Svenja', 'Viardot, Andreas', 'Marks, Reinhard', 'Diedrich, Helmut', 'Faul, Christoph', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Horst, Heinz-August', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Wessiepe, Dorothea', 'Holland, Chris', 'Alekar, Shilpa', 'Mergen, Noemi', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Bargou, Ralf C']","['Topp MS', 'Gokbuget N', 'Zugmaier G', 'Klappers P', 'Stelljes M', 'Neumann S', 'Viardot A', 'Marks R', 'Diedrich H', 'Faul C', 'Reichle A', 'Horst HA', 'Bruggemann M', 'Wessiepe D', 'Holland C', 'Alekar S', 'Mergen N', 'Einsele H', 'Hoelzer D', 'Bargou RC']","['Max S.

Here, we show that standard blood collection procedures rapidly change the transcriptional and posttranscriptional landscapes of hematopoietic cells, resulting in biased activation of specific biological pathways; up-regulation of pseudogenes, antisense RNAs, and unannotated coding isoforms; and RNA surveillance inhibition. Affected genes include common mutational targets and thousands of other genes participating in processes such as chromatin modification, RNA splicing, T- and B-cell activation, and NF-kappaB signaling. The majority of published leukemic transcriptomes exhibit signals of this incubation-induced dysregulation, explaining up to 40% of differences in gene expression and alternative splicing between leukemias and reference normal transcriptomes. The effects of sample processing are particularly evident in pan-cancer analyses. We provide biomarkers that detect prolonged incubation of individual samples and show that keeping blood on ice markedly reduces changes to the transcriptome. In addition to highlighting the potentially confounding effects of technical artifacts in cancer genomics data, our study emphasizes the need to survey the diversity of normal as well as neoplastic cells when characterizing tumors.","['Dvinge, Heidi', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Ilagan, Janine O', 'Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Bradley, Robert K']","['Dvinge H', 'Ries RE', 'Ilagan JO', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Meshinchi S', 'Bradley RK']","['Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Basic Sciences Division, and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109; and.', 'Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Basic Sciences Division, and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109; and Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.', 'Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Basic Sciences Division, and rbradley@fhcrc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141110,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcriptome']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1413374111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1413374111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Nov 25;111(47):16802-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1413374111.

Furthermore, we found that image features for efficient discrimination reside in cellular components. In fact, extensive analysis of nuclear morphologies revealed dynamic and characteristic signatures, including the linear form of the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML)-defined structure in iPSCs, which was reversed to a regular sphere upon differentiation. Our data revealed that iPSCs have a markedly different overall nuclear architecture that may contribute to highly accurate discrimination based on the cell reprogramming status.","['Tokunaga, Kazuaki', 'Saitoh, Noriko', 'Goldberg, Ilya G', 'Sakamoto, Chiyomi', 'Yasuda, Yoko', 'Yoshida, Yoshinori', 'Yamanaka, Shinya', 'Nakao, Mitsuyoshi']","['Tokunaga K', 'Saitoh N', 'Goldberg IG', 'Sakamoto C', 'Yasuda Y', 'Yoshida Y', 'Yamanaka S', 'Nakao M']","['1] Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan [2] Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan.', '1] Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan [2] Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Image Informatics and Computational Biology Unit, Laboratory of Genetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.', 'Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', '1] Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan [2] Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, 1650 Owens Street, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.', '1] Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan [2] Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141111,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['*Artificial Intelligence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics', 'Humans', '*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*statistics & numerical data']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['srep06996 [pii]', '10.1038/srep06996 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2014 Nov 11;4:6996. doi: 10.1038/srep06996.,,,,PMC4227026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that E. fortunei possesses anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, and anti-diabetic activities, as well as cytotoxicity to human leukemia cells. However, at non-toxic concentrations, the effects of an aqueous extract of E. fortunei (WEF) on the metastatic and angiogenic potential of malignant tumor cells have not been reported. In this study, we found that WEF suppressed the metastatic properties, including anchorage-independent colony formation, migration, and invasion, by downregulating the proteolytic activity of MMP-9. NF-kappaB activation and the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK were reduced significantly by WEF. Additionally, WEF inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis markedly, affecting HUVEC migration, tube formation by HUVECs, and microvessel sprouting from rat aortic rings via a reduction in VEGF in tumors. In a pulmonary metastasis model, daily administration of WEF at 50 mg/kg markedly decreased metastatic colonies of intravenously injected B16F10 cells on the lung surface in C57BL/6J mice. Further, none of the WEF-administered mice exhibited systemic toxicity. Taken together, our results indicate that WEF is a potential therapeutic herbal product that may be useful for controlling malignant metastatic cancer.","['Kim, Aeyung', 'Im, Minju', 'Yim, Nam-Hui', 'Ma, Jin Yeul']","['Kim A', 'Im M', 'Yim NH', 'Ma JY']","['Korean Medicine (KM)-Based Herbal Drug Development Group, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 483 Expo-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-811, Republic of Korea.', 'Korean Medicine (KM)-Based Herbal Drug Development Group, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 483 Expo-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-811, Republic of Korea.', 'Korean Medicine (KM)-Based Herbal Drug Development Group, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 483 Expo-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-811, Republic of Korea.', 'Korean Medicine (KM)-Based Herbal Drug Development Group, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 483 Expo-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-811, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141111,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Aorta/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Eupatorium/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/secondary', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/prevention & control', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/metabolism/pathology/prevention & control', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['srep06994 [pii]', '10.1038/srep06994 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2014 Nov 11;4:6994. doi: 10.1038/srep06994.,,,,PMC4227014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have designed a real-time PCR method implementing the Mutant enrichment with 3'-modified oligonucleotides (MEMO) technique to detect NPM1 mutations and validated its utility in clinical samples. METHODS: Sensitivity and linearity were evaluated using serially diluted NPM1-positive samples. Clinical usefulness was assessed by measuring the levels of mutant alleles in 29 patients at diagnosis and in ten patients after induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Excellent linear relationships between the mutant allele proportion and the threshold cycle (Ct) values (r = 0.999) were observed in a range of 1:1-1:10(3) . MEMO-PCR was able to detect NPM1 mutations regardless of mutant type and also detected novel mutants (964_967delTGGAinsATGATGTC, 957_959delCTGinsATGCATG, 960insTAAG, and 960insTCAG). The concentrations of NPM1 mutant alleles decreased after induction chemotherapy in accordance with the reduction of tumor cells, and in one case, NPM1 mutant alleles were detectable about 7 months before morphological relapse. CONCLUSION: MEMO-quantitative PCR was shown to detect virtually all types of NPM1 mutants with high sensitivity and specificity. This novel method may be useful in the diagnosis of AML with an NPM1 mutation, the detection of minimal residual disease, and the monitoring of treatment response.","['Shin, Sang-Yong', 'Ki, Chang-Seok', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Kim, Jong-Won', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Lee, Seung-Tae']","['Shin SY', 'Ki CS', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim JW', 'Kim SH', 'Lee ST']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141110,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotides/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/12 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2013/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcla.21779 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2015 Sep;29(5):361-5. doi: 10.1002/jcla.21779.

Constitutive aberrant activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway has been detected in various lymphoid malignancies and plays a key role in the development of these carcinomas. The zinc finger-containing protein, A20, is a central regulator of multiple NF-kappaB-activating signaling cascades. A20 is frequently inactivated by deletions and/or mutations in several B-and T-cell lymphoma subtypes. However, few A20 mutations and polymorphisms have been reported in T-ALL. Thus, it is of interest to analyze the expression characteristics of A20 and its regulating factors, including upstream regulators and the CBM complex, which includes CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1. METHODS: The expression levels of CARMA1, BCL10, MALT1, A20, and NF-kappaB were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 21 patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL using real-time PCR, and correlations between the aberrant expression of these genes in T-ALL was analyzed. Sixteen healthy individuals, including 10 males and 6 females, served as controls. RESULTS: Significantly lower A20 expression was found in T-ALL patients (median: 4.853) compared with healthy individuals (median: 8.748; P = 0.017), and significantly increased expression levels of CARMA1 (median: 2.916; P = 0.034), BCL10 (median: 0.285; P = 0.033), and MALT1 (median: 1.201; P = 0.010) were found in T-ALL compared with the healthy individuals (median: 1.379, 0.169, and 0.677, respectively). In contrast, overexpression of NF-kappaB (median: 0.714) was found in T-ALL compared with healthy individuals (median: 0.335; P = 0.001). A negative correlation between the MALT1 and A20 expression levels and a positive correlation between CARMA1 and BCL10 were found in T-ALL and healthy individuals. However, no negative correlation was found between A20 and NF-kappaB and the MALT1 and NF-kappaB expression level in the T-ALL group. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized the expression of the CARMA-BCL10-MALT1-A20-NF-kappaB pathway genes in T-ALL. Overexpression of CARMA-BCL10-MALT in T-ALL may contribute to the constitutive cleavage and inactivation of A20, which enhances NF-kappaB signaling and may be related to T-ALL pathogenesis.","['Ma, Yu', 'Liao, Ziwei', 'Xu, Yi', 'Zhong, Ziyun', 'Wang, Xu', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Luo, Gengxin', 'Huang, Xin', 'Huang, Suming', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Ma Y', 'Liao Z', 'Xu Y', 'Zhong Z', 'Wang X', 'Zhang F', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Luo G', 'Huang X', 'Huang S', 'Wu X', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. siulier@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141111,England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (BCL10 protein, human)', '0 (CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (MALT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (CARD11 protein, human)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Guanylate Cyclase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3']",2014/11/12 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2014/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['s40001-014-0062-8 [pii]', '10.1186/s40001-014-0062-8 [doi]']",epublish,Eur J Med Res. 2014 Nov 11;19:62. doi: 10.1186/s40001-014-0062-8.,,,,PMC4228272,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we tried to investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of its bromo analogue (TBr), a potent cytotoxic agent in the induction of cancer cell death. It was found that TBr primarily targets STAT3 and ERK signaling during the induction of apoptosis in several human leukemia cell lines. In HL-60 cells, TBr treatment caused early down regulation of p-STAT3 with concomitant up regulation of p-ERK which led to the activation of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The mechanism of TBr mediated inhibition of p-STAT3 was found to be due to the activation of ubiquitin dependent degradation of tyrosine 705 and serine 727 p-STAT3. As IL-6 is the main driver of the STAT3 pathway, the effect of TBr on cell death was subdued when treated in the combination with IL-6 in HL60 cells. Interestingly, PD98059 significantly reduced the apoptotic effects of TBr, thus showing the direct involvement of p-ERK in TBr mediated cell death. It was further shown that apoptotic protein Bax silencing in HL-60 cells resists TBr mediated ERK dependent apoptosis. In summary, for the first time we report the mechanism of TBr mediated cell death in human leukemia cell lines by targeting STAT3 and ERK pathways.","['Pathania, Anup S', 'Kumar, Suresh', 'Guru, Santosh K', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Sharma, Parduman R', 'Aithagani, Sravan K', 'Singh, Parvinder P', 'Vishwakarma, Ram A', 'Kumar, Ajay', 'Malik, Fayaz']","['Pathania AS', 'Kumar S', 'Guru SK', 'Bhushan S', 'Sharma PR', 'Aithagani SK', 'Singh PP', 'Vishwakarma RA', 'Kumar A', 'Malik F']","['Department of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Medicinal chemistry division, Indian institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), New Delhi, India.', 'Medicinal chemistry division, Indian institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Medicinal chemistry division, Indian institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu and Kashmir, India; Experimental Breast Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Michigan North Campus Research Complex, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141110,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '13220-57-0 (tryptanthrine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/physiology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Quinazolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",2014/11/11 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/11/11 06:00'],"['2014/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0110411 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-07961 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 10;9(11):e110411. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0110411. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4226462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib mesylate (IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is highly effective in the treatment of chronic phase CML. BCR - ABL transcripts have been well established as a molecular marker to document response to therapy in CML. Periodic monitoring of this marker helps in evolving therapeutic strategies with IM and also in diagnosing early relapse. This study was undertaken to monitor therapeutic response to IM in CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) by assessing BCR-ABL by real time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) techniques and to determine the effectiveness of the Indian generic IM. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients of CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) were treated with an Indian generic of IM. Eighty-five patients were evaluable at 12 months of therapy. At entry, diagnosis of CML-CP was confirmed by FISH and RQ-PCR. Response to therapy was monitored by assessing BCR-ABL levels by RQ-PCR at 6 and 12 months of therapy. Regular follow up of patients was done to evaluate the safety profile of IM used in these patients. RESULTS: Complete hematological response (CHR) rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 92%, 94%, 100% and 100% respectively.

Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by chronic, recurrent and self healing skin lesions. Up to 20% of patients with LyP have a coexistent lymphoma. While the association between the two entities has been reported, their coexistence has never been documented. We describe a 74-year-old man with known CLL and thrombocytopenia who presented with a 2 year history of recurrent nodules and plaques to both arms and legs that resolved within 4-6 weeks after administration of rituximab and bendamustin for his CLL treatment. His biopsies showed an atypical lymphoid infiltrate, composed of large and pleomorphic cells with a nodular and interstitial pattern in a background of eosinophils. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a pattern of two separate yet coexisting neoplastic processes; a large CD30 positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, while the other one was diagnostic of a neoplastic B-cell process (leukemia cutis). A diagnosis of coexistent LyP and cutaneous involvement by CLL/SLL was rendered. The simultaneous presence of both disorders can be a pitfall in the differential diagnosis of large cell lymphomas, such as Richter's transformation of CLL/SLL.","['Hibler, J', 'Salavaggione, Andrea L', 'Martin, Ann', 'Gru, Alejandro A']","['Hibler J', 'Salavaggione AL', 'Martin A', 'Gru AA']","[""O'Bleness Hospital, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150203,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphomatoid Papulosis/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male']",2014/11/11 06:00,2016/01/12 06:00,['2014/11/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cup.12435 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2015 Apr;42(4):276-84. doi: 10.1111/cup.12435.

These observations suggest that there is a profound thymic dysregulation, which is difficult to study in AML patients. Using the C1498 AML mouse model, we demonstrated that leukemia development was associated with thymus atrophy, which was defined by abnormal organ weight and reduced cellularity. In addition, we observed a dramatic loss of peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell numbers with increased frequencies of CD4(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory and activated/memory T cells. Investigating the mechanisms leading to this atrophy, we observed a significant accumulation of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2) in thymi of leukemic mice. Treatment of AML-bearing animals with a blocking anti-CCL2 antibody revealed a lower tumor burden, augmented antileukemic T-cell responses, and improved survival rate compared to nontreated mice. These results were not observed when neutralization of CCL2 was performed in thymectomized mice. Altogether, we show that the CCL2 protein participates in thymic atrophy in AML mice, and this could have important implications for future immunotherapeutic strategies.","['Driss, Virginie', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Brinster, Carine']","['Driss V', 'Quesnel B', 'Brinster C']","['Institut pour la Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille (IRCL), INSERM U.837, Lille Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141204,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Ccl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*pharmacology', 'Atrophy', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Chemokine CCL2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organ Size', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thymectomy', 'Thymus Gland/*drug effects/immunology/pathology']",2014/11/11 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/11/11 06:00'],"['2014/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201444736 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2015 Feb;45(2):396-406. doi: 10.1002/eji.201444736.

This study aimed to investigate the immune regulation of H2S in pediatric ALL. METHODS: Children (n = 78) with ALL admitted during 2010-2013 were included in this study. Two blood samples were collected in period of before chemotherapy, bone marrow remission and two days after chemotherapy, respectively. Serum contents of H2S and cytokines, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), were detected using ELISA method. Stepwise regression was used to analyze the correlation between H2S and cytokines. Furthermore, human Jurkat cells were cultured in vitro, and nucleoprotein of Jurkat cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected, contents of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and certain cytokines were measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of H2S, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10 and MIP-1a in children with ALL were increased significantly (P < 0.01), while concentrations of IL-2, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-4 decreased obviously (P < 0.01). In patients after chemotherapy, concentrations of H2S and IL-10 were decreased significantly (P < 0.05), but IL-4 and IFN-gamma concentrations increased markedly (P < 0.05). At remission stage, H2S, IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and MIP-1alpha concentrations were further decreased markedly (P < 0.05), but concentrations of IL-2, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma increased again (P < 0.05). Protein contents of CSE, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-2 of PBMCs also increased markedly in children with ALL. Moreover, changes of CSE protein contents of PBMCs were consistent with serum H2S contents, and there were significant correlation between H2S and certain cytokines based on stepwise regression analysis. Furthermore, compared with those of PBMCs group, in vitro study indicated that Jurkat cells of H2S group expressed IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-2 protein increased obviously (P < 0.05), while IL-4, IL-2 and CSE expression of PPG group decreased markedly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Gaseous molecule H2S might participate in the process of immune regulation in pediatric ALL through modulating transcription and expression of cytokines.","['Du, Shuxu', 'Jia, Yongrui', 'Tang, Hong', 'Sun, Yangling', 'Wu, Wanshui', 'Sun, Liming', 'Du, Junbao', 'Geng, Bin', 'Tang, Chaoshu', 'Jin, Hongfang']","['Du S', 'Jia Y', 'Tang H', 'Sun Y', 'Wu W', 'Sun L', 'Du J', 'Geng B', 'Tang C', 'Jin H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Health Science Center, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.

During infection, PARP13 binds viral RNA via its four CCCH-type zinc-finger domains and targets it for degradation by recruiting cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) decay factors such as the exosome complex and XRN1. Here we show that PARP13 binds to and regulates cellular mRNAs in the absence of viral infection. Knockdown of PARP13 results in the misregulation of hundreds of transcripts. Among the most upregulated transcripts is TRAILR4 that encodes a decoy receptor for TRAIL-a pro-apoptotic cytokine that is a promising target for the therapeutic inhibition of cancers. PARP13 destabilizes TRAILR4 mRNA post-transcriptionally in an exosome-dependent manner by binding to a region in its 3' untranslated region. As a consequence, PARP13 represses TRAILR4 expression and increases cell sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, acting as a key regulator of the cellular response to TRAIL.","['Todorova, Tanya', 'Bock, Florian J', 'Chang, Paul']","['Todorova T', 'Bock FJ', 'Chang P']","['1] Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 500 Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA [2] Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 500 Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 500 Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', '1] Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 500 Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA [2] Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 500 Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141110,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TNFRSF10D protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (ZC3HAV1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Exosomes/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptome/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors/genetics/*physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/physiology']",2014/11/11 06:00,2016/02/24 06:00,['2014/11/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms6362 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms6362 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Nov 10;5:5362. doi: 10.1038/ncomms6362.,,,"['P30 CA014051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM087465/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM087465/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4228382,['NIHMS630791'],,,,['GEO/GSE56667'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Etoposide, a topoisomerase-II inhibitor, however, has been associated with a significant increase in secondary leukemia. The rationale for substituting topotecan, a topoisomerase-I inhibitor, for etoposide in this regimen, a topoisomerase-II inhibitor, includes its limited toxicity profile and decreased leukemogenicity. Furthermore, topotecan in combination with both alkylators and platinating agents are additive and/or synergistic against a variety of solid tumors. PROCEDURE: Patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors received ifosfamide (9 g/m(2) ) and carboplatin (area under the curve: 3 mg/ml/min). Topotecan was also administered at 0.5 mg/m(2) /day x 3 days (N = 12) and in a small cohort (N = 3) at 0.75 mg/m(2) /day. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were entered onto study. Two patients developed seizures/encephalitis secondary to ifosfamide. One patient had dose-limiting thrombocytopenia secondary to TIC that resolved with supportive care. Patients received a median of three cycles (1-3) of TIC. Of the 14 evaluable patients for response, 4/14 had a complete response (CR), 2/14 had a partial response (PR), and 1/14 patients had stable disease (SD). The ORR (CR + PR) was 43%. CONCLUSION: TIC chemotherapy is feasible and tolerable in children and adolescents with refractory/recurrent solid tumors and lymphomas and results in a 43% excellent ORR in this poor-risk group of patients. A larger cohort of patients, especially in Wilms tumor and central nervous system (CNS) tumors, should be studied in the future to attempt to confirm these preliminary findings.

Here we discover that inhibition of antioxidant defenses via glutathione (GSH) depletion by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) primes ALL cells for apoptosis induced by the Smac mimetic BV6 that antagonizes IAP proteins. Similarly, BSO cooperates with BV6 to induce cell death in patient-derived primary leukemic samples, underscoring the clinical relevance. In contrast, BSO does not sensitize non-malignant lymphohematopoietic cells from healthy donors toward BV6, pointing to some tumor selectivity. Mechanistically, both agents cooperate to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is required for BSO/BV6-induced cell death, as ROS inhibitors (that is, N-acetylcysteine, MnTBAP, Trolox) significantly rescue cell death. Further, BSO and BV6 cooperate to trigger lipid peroxidation, which is necessary for cell death, as genetic or pharmacological blockage of lipid peroxidation by GSH peroxidase 4 (GPX4) overexpression or alpha-tocopherol significantly inhibits BSO/BV6-mediated cell death. Consistently, GPX4 knockdown or GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 enhances lipid peroxidation and cell death by BSO/BV6 cotreatment.

Oral mucositis was evaluated using WHO's assessment scale. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, Spearman's correlation, Ordinal logistic regression, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: A total of 69.8% of the patients evaluated developed oral mucositis (grade II and over). As a results of ordinal regression, factors influencing oral mucositis severity were found to be diagnosis, type of transplantation, oxygen inhalation and the number of antiemetics administration before transplantation. The severity of oral mucositis was found to increase the days of hospitalization, days of TPN administration, days of using antibiotics and the number and dosage of analgesics.

Few cases of solid cancers have been reported in childhood. PROCEDURES: We conducted a national retrospective study of solid tumors occurring in patients registered with or determined to have FA during childhood in France. Phenotypic features, tumor type, cancer treatment, and outcome were analyzed. Whenever available, fresh-frozen tumors were analyzed by microarray-based comparative genomics hybridization. RESULTS: We identified eight patients with FA with solid tumor from 1986 to 2012. For two patients, the diagnosis of FA was unknown at the time of cancer diagnosis. Moreover, we identified one fetus with a brain tumor. All patients showed failure to thrive and had dysmorphic features and abnormal skin pigmentation. Seven patients had BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations; five of these featured more than one malignancy and the median age at the time of cancer diagnosis was 11 months (range 0.4-3 years). Solid tumor types included five nephroblastomas, two rhabdomyosarcomas, two neuroblastomas, and three brain tumors. Two children died from the toxic effects of chemotherapy, two patients from the cancer, and one patient from secondary leukemia. Only one BRCA2 patient was alive more than 3 years after diagnosis, after tailored chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Solid tumors are rare in FA during childhood, except in patients with BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations. The proper genetic diagnosis is mandatory to tailor the treatment.","['Malric, Aurore', 'Defachelles, Anne-Sophie', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Lescoeur, Brigitte', 'Lacour, Brigitte', 'Peuchmaur, Michel', 'Maurage, Claude-Alain', 'Pierron, Gaelle', 'Guillemot, Delphine', ""d'Enghien, Catherine Dubois"", 'Soulier, Jean', 'Stoppa-Lyonnet, Dominique', 'Bourdeaut, Franck']","['Malric A', 'Defachelles AS', 'Leblanc T', 'Lescoeur B', 'Lacour B', 'Peuchmaur M', 'Maurage CA', 'Pierron G', 'Guillemot D', ""d'Enghien CD"", 'Soulier J', 'Stoppa-Lyonnet D', 'Bourdeaut F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Curie Institute, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141108,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'BRCA2 Protein/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Fanconi Anemia/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Survival Rate', '*Wilms Tumor/drug therapy/genetics/mortality']",2014/11/11 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/11 06:00'],"['2014/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25303 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Mar;62(3):463-70. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25303.

Advances in the genomics of acute myeloid leukemia have identified several recurrent gene mutations whose prognostic impact is being deciphered. We used HaloPlex target enrichment and Illumina-based next generation sequencing to study 24 recurrently mutated genes in 42 samples of acute myeloid leukemia with a normal karyotype. Read depth varied between and within genes for the same sample, but was predictable and highly consistent across samples. Consequently, we were able to detect copy number changes, such as an interstitial deletion of BCOR, three MLL partial tandem duplications, and a novel KRAS amplification. With regards to coding mutations, we identified likely oncogenic variants in 41 of 42 samples. NPM1 mutations were the most frequent, followed by FLT3, DNMT3A and TET2. NPM1 and FLT3 indels were reported with good efficiency. We also showed that DNMT3A mutations can persist post-chemotherapy and in 2 cases studied at diagnosis and relapse, we were able to delineate the dynamics of tumor evolution and give insights into order of acquisition of variants. HaloPlex is a quick and reliable target enrichment method that can aid diagnosis and prognostic stratification of acute myeloid leukemia patients.","['Bolli, Niccolo', 'Manes, Nicla', 'McKerrell, Thomas', 'Chi, Jianxiang', 'Park, Naomi', 'Gundem, Gunes', 'Quail, Michael A', 'Sathiaseelan, Vijitha', 'Herman, Bram', 'Crawley, Charles', 'Craig, Jenny I O', 'Conte, Natalie', 'Grove, Carolyn', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Campbell, Peter J', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'Costeas, Paul', 'Vassiliou, George S']","['Bolli N', 'Manes N', 'McKerrell T', 'Chi J', 'Park N', 'Gundem G', 'Quail MA', 'Sathiaseelan V', 'Herman B', 'Crawley C', 'Craig JI', 'Conte N', 'Grove C', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Campbell PJ', 'Varela I', 'Costeas P', 'Vassiliou GS']","['Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, UK Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'The Center for the Study of Haematological Malignancies, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Sequencing Research and Development, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Sequencing Research and Development, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Agilent Technologies, Agilent Technologies LDA UK Ltd., Cheadle, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria (CSIC-UC-Sodercan), Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.', 'The Center for the Study of Haematological Malignancies, Nicosia, Cyprus Molecular Haematology and Immunogenetics Center, The Karaiskakio Foundation, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK nb8@sanger.ac.uk gsv20@sanger.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141107,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",2014/11/09 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/11/09 06:00'],"['2014/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.113381 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.113381 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Feb;100(2):214-22. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.113381.

Here, we show that 98% of inv(3)/t(3;3) myeloid malignancies harbor mutations in genes activating RAS/receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. In addition, hemizygous mutations in GATA2, as well as heterozygous alterations in RUNX1, SF3B1, and genes encoding epigenetic modifiers, frequently co-occur with the inv(3)/t(3;3) aberration. Notably, neither mutational patterns nor gene expression profiles differ across inv(3)/t(3;3) acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome cases, suggesting recognition of inv(3)/t(3;3) myeloid malignancies as a single disease entity irrespective of blast count.

RESULTS: A two-compartment PK model with sequential zero-first-order absorption and first-order elimination was able to characterize the PK of ibrutinib. The compound was rapidly absorbed, had a high oral plasma clearance (approximately 1,000 L/h) and a high apparent volume of distribution at steady state (approximately 10,000 L). PK parameters were not dependent on dose, study, or clinical indication. The fasting state was characterized by a 67 % relative bioavailability compared with the meal conditions used in the trials and administration after a high-fat meal. Body weight and coadministration of antacids marginally increased volume of distribution and duration of absorption, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed population PK model was able to describe the plasma concentration-time profiles of ibrutinib across various trials. The linear model indicated that the compound's PK was dose independent and time independent.","['Marostica, Eleonora', 'Sukbuntherng, Juthamas', 'Loury, David', 'de Jong, Jan', 'de Trixhe, Xavier Woot', 'Vermeulen, An', 'De Nicolao, Giuseppe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Byrd, John C', 'Advani, Ranjana', 'McGreivy, Jesse', 'Poggesi, Italo']","['Marostica E', 'Sukbuntherng J', 'Loury D', 'de Jong J', 'de Trixhe XW', 'Vermeulen A', 'De Nicolao G', ""O'Brien S"", 'Byrd JC', 'Advani R', 'McGreivy J', 'Poggesi I']","['Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141108,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2014/11/09 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/11/09 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2617-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Jan;75(1):111-21. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2617-3.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely used to accelerate hematopoietic recovery after transplantation and to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with prolonged neutropenia. Biosimilar G-CSF is approved for the same indications as the originator G-CSF. This is one of the first reported uses of a biosimilar G-CSF for neutrophil recovery after APBSCT. METHODS: A total of 23 consecutive patients with hematological malignancy (multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and acute myelogenous leukemia) were recruited at the Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation at the Medical University of Lublin. Patients (12 men and 11 women; median age, 47 +/- 13 years) received biosimilar G-CSF (Zarzio, Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals) after myeloablative chemotherapy (primarily BiCnU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan or melphalan 140/200 mg/m(2)) followed by PBSCT. The median number of transplanted CD34+ cells was 4.2 +/- 0.8 x 10(6)/kg body wt. G-CSF therapy was started when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was <0.5 x 10(9)/L and was continued until ANC reached >1.5 x 10(9)/L for 3 consecutive days. Hematopoietic recovery parameters were compared with those in the control group, which consisted of 23 consecutive patients transplanted in the period before the biosimilar G-CSF group and receiving originator G-CSF (Neupogen, Amgen). RESULTS: The mean duration of treatment with biosimilar and originator G-CSF was 14.4 +/- 5.1 and 18.6 +/- 11.5 days, respectively (P = .43). The adverse event profile was comparable between the biosimilar G-CSF and originator G-CSF groups, with similar occurrence of neutropenic fever (5 versus 6 patients) and bone pain (7 patients in each group). One patient in the biosimilar group had neutropenic enterocolitis and sepsis. There was no case of death in either group. Granulocyte recovery in the study group was as follows: mean days to ANC >0.5 x 10(9)/L was 13.0 +/- 4.0 days; to ANC >1.5 x 10(9)/L, 13.6 +/- 4.5 days; and to ANC >1.5 x 10(9)/L, 14.0 +/- 4.7 days. Mean duration until platelet recovery >20 x 10(9)/L was 16.1 +/- 4.4 days. There were no statistically significant differences between the biosimilar and originator G-CSF groups in hematopoietic recovery parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Biosimilar G-CSF is safe and effective in reducing the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by APBSCT and probably in cost savings in transplantation budgets.","['Cioch, M', 'Jawniak, D', 'Kotwica, K', 'Wach, M', 'Manko, J', 'Goracy, A', 'Klimek, P', 'Mazurkiewicz, E', 'Jarosz, P', 'Hus, M']","['Cioch M', 'Jawniak D', 'Kotwica K', 'Wach M', 'Manko J', 'Goracy A', 'Klimek P', 'Mazurkiewicz E', 'Jarosz P', 'Hus M']","['Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland.

In the present study, we compared non-infectious transplantation-related complications (NITRCs) post-CBT in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with those following related bone marrow and peripheral blood transplantation and unrelated BM transplantation. We analyzed 108 patients with AML who received HSCT at the Konan Kosei Hospital between 1992 and 2013. After a median follow-up of 74 months, the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 49.4 % with no differences between graft sources. The cumulative incidence of total NITRCs was 36 % at day 100. After adjusted analyses, patients with NITRCs showed significantly decreased OS [relative risk (RR) 3.51; p < 0.001) and increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (RR 6.49; p < 0.001) compared with patients without NITRCs. Although the cumulative NITRC incidence did not differ among transplantation groups, NRM in patients with NITRCs was significantly lower in CB recipients than in other graft recipients (11.2 versus 68.4 %, p = 0.015). These data suggest that NITRCs contribute significantly to the outcome of HSCT and that the low virulence of NITRCs favored CBT for adult AML.","['Watamoto, Koichi', 'Kohno, Akio', 'Adachi, Yoshitaka', 'Umemura, Kohji', 'Yamaguchi, Yohei', 'Tatekawa, Shotaro', 'Ozeki, Kazutaka', 'Morishita, Yoshihisa']","['Watamoto K', 'Kohno A', 'Adachi Y', 'Umemura K', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Tatekawa S', 'Ozeki K', 'Morishita Y']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, JA Aichi Konan Kosei Hospital, Konan, Aichi, 483-8704, Japan, watamoto51@yahoo.co.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141108,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/09 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/11/09 06:00'],"['2014/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1695-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Jan;101(1):83-91. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1695-7.

This study applied D. salina to syngeneic leukemia-implanted mice (BALB/c and WEHI-3) to investigate its immunological and antileukemia properties. Oral administration of D. salina (184.5, 369, and 922.5 mg/kg) inhibited spleen metastasis and prolonged the survival in BALB/c mice that had received an intravenous injection of WEHI-3 cells. The results revealed that D. salina had reduced spleen enlargement in murine leukemia. It had also increased the population and proliferation of T-cells (CD3) and B-cells (CD19) following Con A/LPS treatment on flow cytometry and MTT assay, respectively. Furthermore, D. salina increased the phagocytosis of macrophages and enhanced the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells on flow cytometry and LDH assay. Moreover, D. salina enhanced the levels of interferon-gamma and interleukin 2 (IL-2) but reduced the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in leukemic mice. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the application of D. salina had beneficial effects on WEHI-3 leukemic mice by prolonging survival via modulating the immune responses.","['Chuang, Wen-Chen', 'Ho, Yung-Chyuan', 'Liao, Jiunn-Wang', 'Lu, Fung-Jou']","['Chuang WC', 'Ho YC', 'Liao JW', 'Lu FJ']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and double daggerGraduate Institute of Veterinary Pathobiology, National Chung Hsing University , Taichung 402, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141114,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitogens)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-10/blood', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Interleukin-4/blood', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Volvocida/*chemistry']",2014/11/08 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/11/08 06:00'],"['2014/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jf503564b [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2014 Nov 26;62(47):11479-87. doi: 10.1021/jf503564b.

During the last two decades, reports show that both viruses also infect or affect other species of the family Felidae.

We investigated FIV and FeLV infection in free-ranging guignas (Leopardus guigna) and sympatric domestic cats in human perturbed landscapes on Chiloe Island, Chile. Samples from 78 domestic cats and 15 guignas were collected from 2008 to 2010 and analyzed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Two guignas and two domestic cats were positive for FIV; three guignas and 26 domestic cats were positive for FeLV. The high percentage of nucleotide identity of FIV and FeLV sequences from both species suggests possible interspecies transmission of viruses, facilitated by increased contact probability through human invasion into natural habitats, fragmentation of guigna habitat, and poultry attacks by guignas.

We investigated copy number variation (CNV) frequencies for pharmacogenes using The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two pharmacogenes were selected from liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), acute myeloid leukemia, and lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL). The germ line and somatic CNV frequencies were analyzed. RESULTS: We found CNVs with more than 1% frequency in drug-metabolizing enzymes including CYP2A6, CYP2D6, GSTP1, CYP2E1, GSTM1, GSTT1, and SULT1A1, drug transporters such as SLC19A1 and SLC28A1, and targets such as FHIT in normal tissue or blood. GSTM1 had the highest frequency for gene gain (45.45, 39.18, 31.01, and 34.77%, respectively) and for gene loss (18.18, 29.38, 20.89, and 26.68%, respectively) in DLBL, acute myeloid leukemia, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and LUSC.

The present study evaluated the health-related quality of life of patients undergoing chemotherapy for the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas (LL) and solid tumors (ST) while receiving Selenium (Se) supplementation. This is a randomized, double-blind, crossover study that evaluated the quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire), renal and liver functions of patients supplemented with Se. There was no statistically significant alteration in LL patients. However, the fatigue and nausea scores after 30 days did decrease in this group as well as in the ST group. After 1 year supplementation with Selenium, a more noticeable decrease in the scores concerning fatigue and nausea could be observed in the ST group, when compared with the beginning of the study. The LL patients also presented a decrease in the fatigue scores and physical functions. The kidney function as well as liver function has improved after Selenium supplementation when compared with the placebo intake in LL and ST patients, more remarkably in the LL group. Supplementation with Selenium promotes the reduction of chemotherapy side effects in cancer patients, especially by improving the conditions of patients with fatigue, nausea, and impaired physical function.

Surgery and radiation therapy have been the mainstay for brain tumor treatment. However, chemotherapy is becoming more important for patients who are not eligible for radiotherapy owing to age. Stem cell transplant as a means of high dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue is a new treatment modality and is often repeated for improved survival. Drugs such as temozolomide are new chemotherapeutic options. In order to achieve 100% cure in children with pediatric cancer, every possible treatment modality and effort should be considered.","['Ju, Hee Young', 'Hong, Che Ry', 'Shin, Hee Young']","['Ju HY', 'Hong CR', 'Shin HY']","['Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141031,Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,,2014/11/08 06:00,2014/11/08 06:01,['2014/11/08 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2014.57.10.434 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2014 Oct;57(10):434-9. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2014.57.10.434.

ETS factors control the expression of genes involved in many biological processes, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. FLI1 is an ETS protein aberrantly expressed in retrovirus-induced hematological tumors, but limited attention has been directed towards elucidating the role of FLI1 in epithelial-derived cancers. Using data mining, we show that loss of FLI1 expression is associated with shorter survival and more aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer. Gain and loss of function cellular studies indicate the inhibitory effect of FLI1 expression on cellular growth, migration, and invasion. Using Fli1 mutant mice and both a transgenic murine breast cancer model and an orthotopic injection of syngeneic tumor cells indicates that reduced Fli1 contributes to accelerated tumor growth. Global expression analysis and RNA-Seq data from an invasive human breast cancer cell line with over expression of either FLI1 and another ETS gene, PDEF, shows changes in several cellular pathways associated with cancer, such as the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. This study demonstrates a novel role for FLI1 in epithelial cells. In addition, these results reveal that FLI1 down-regulation in breast cancer may promote tumor progression.","['Scheiber, Melissa N', 'Watson, Patricia M', 'Rumboldt, Tihana', 'Stanley, Connor', 'Wilson, Robert C', 'Findlay, Victoria J', 'Anderson, Paul E', 'Watson, Dennis K']","['Scheiber MN', 'Watson PM', 'Rumboldt T', 'Stanley C', 'Wilson RC', 'Findlay VJ', 'Anderson PE', 'Watson DK']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The James E.

It has been shown that cAMP-mediated protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulates the production of these factors. We have previously reported that exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2, RAPGEF4), another cAMP mediator, is involved in the differentiation of endometrial stromal cells through the regulation of the expression of calreticulin (CALR). To address whether EPAC2-CALR signaling is involved in the expression of implantation-related factors, we examined the effect of EPAC2 and CALR knockdown on their expression in cultured human endometrial glandular epithelial EM1 cells, treated with forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, an EPAC-selective cAMP analog (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyl cAMP (CPT)), or a PKA-selective cAMP analog (N(6)-phenyl-cAMP (Phe)). In addition, the status of cell senescence was examined. EPAC2 knockdown suppressed the expression of CALR protein and mRNA in EM1 cells. Forskolin- or Phe-, but not CPT-, induced expression of LIF or PTGS2 and secretion of PGE2 was inhibited in EPAC2- or CALR-silenced EM1 cells. In addition, knockdown of EPAC2 or CALR increased senescence-associated beta galactosidase activity and expression of p21 but decreased expression of p53. These findings indicate that expression of CALR regulated by EPAC2 in endometrial glandular epithelial cells is critical for the expression of LIF and PTGS2-mediated production of PGE2 through cAMP signaling. Furthermore, EPAC2 and CALR could play a role in the maintenance of gland function.","['Kusama, Kazuya', 'Yoshie, Mikihiro', 'Tamura, Kazuhiro', 'Imakawa, Kazuhiko', 'Tachikawa, Eiichi']","['Kusama K', 'Yoshie M', 'Tamura K', 'Imakawa K', 'Tachikawa E']","['Department of Endocrine and Neural PharmacologyTokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, JapanLaboratory of Theriogenology and Animal BreedingGraduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan Department of Endocrine and Neural PharmacologyTokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, JapanLaboratory of Theriogenology and Animal BreedingGraduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrine and Neural PharmacologyTokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, JapanLaboratory of Theriogenology and Animal BreedingGraduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrine and Neural PharmacologyTokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, JapanLaboratory of Theriogenology and Animal BreedingGraduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan hiro@toyaku.ac.jp.', 'Department of Endocrine and Neural PharmacologyTokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, JapanLaboratory of Theriogenology and Animal BreedingGraduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrine and Neural PharmacologyTokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, JapanLaboratory of Theriogenology and Animal BreedingGraduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141106,England,J Mol Endocrinol,Journal of molecular endocrinology,8902617,"['0 (CALB2 protein, human)', '0 (Calbindin 2)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RAPGEF4 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Calbindin 2/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endometrium/*cytology', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/11/08 06:00,2015/09/10 06:00,['2014/11/08 06:00'],"['2014/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JME-14-0162 [pii]', '10.1530/JME-14-0162 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Endocrinol. 2015 Feb;54(1):17-24. doi: 10.1530/JME-14-0162.

Transplantation with cord blood allows for faster availability of frozen sample and avoids invasive procedures for donors. In addition, this procedure has demonstrated reduced relapse rates and similar overall survival when compared with unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The limited dose of CD34-positive stem cells available with single-unit cord transplantation has been addressed by the development of double-unit cord transplantation. In combination with improved conditioning regimens, double-unit cord transplantation has allowed for the treatment of larger children, as well as adult patients with hematological malignancies.

We investigated if biomarkers could predict aGVHD and TRM after day 28 in CBT recipients. Day 28 samples from 113 CBT patients were analyzed. Suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) was the only biomarker associated with grades II-IV and III-IV aGVHD and TRM. Day 180 grade III-IV aGVHD in patients with high ST2 levels was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18-43) vs 13% (95% CI, 5-23) in patients with low levels (P = .024). The adverse effect of elevated ST2 was independent of HLA match. Moreover, high day 28 ST2 levels were associated with increased TRM with day 180 estimates of 23% (95% CI, 13-35) vs 5% (95% CI, 1-13) if levels were low (P = .001). GVHD was the most common cause of death in high ST2 patients. High concentrations of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, interleukin-8, and regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha were also associated with TRM. Our results are consistent with those of adult donor allografts and warrant further prospective evaluation to facilitate future therapeutic intervention to ameliorate severe aGVHD and further improve survival after CBT.","['Ponce, Doris M', 'Hilden, Patrick', 'Mumaw, Christen', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Lubin, Marissa', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Goldberg, Jenna D', 'Hanash, Alan', 'Hsu, Katharine', 'Jenq, Robert', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Sauter, Craig', 'van den Brink, Marcel R M', 'Young, James W', 'Brentjens, Renier', 'Kernan, Nancy A', 'Prockop, Susan E', ""O'Reilly, Richard J"", 'Scaradavou, Andromachi', 'Paczesny, Sophie', 'Barker, Juliet N']","['Ponce DM', 'Hilden P', 'Mumaw C', 'Devlin SM', 'Lubin M', 'Giralt S', 'Goldberg JD', 'Hanash A', 'Hsu K', 'Jenq R', 'Perales MA', 'Sauter C', 'van den Brink MR', 'Young JW', 'Brentjens R', 'Kernan NA', 'Prockop SE', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Scaradavou A', 'Paczesny S', 'Barker JN']","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;

Here, we performed a longitudinal study in a homogeneously treated cohort of 12 patients, with sequential samples obtained at comparable stages of disease. We identified clonal competition between 2 or more genetic subclones in 70% of the patients with relapse, and stable clonal dynamics in the remaining 30%. By deep sequencing, we identified a high reservoir of genetic heterogeneity in the form of several driver genes mutated in small subclones underlying the disease course. Furthermore, in 2 patients, we identified convergent evolution, characterized by the combination of genetic lesions affecting the same genes or copy number abnormality in different subclones. The phenomenon affects multiple CLL putative driver abnormalities, including mutations in NOTCH1, SF3B1, DDX3X, and del(11q23). This is the first report documenting convergent evolution as a recurrent event in the CLL genome. Furthermore, this finding suggests the selective advantage of specific combinations of genetic lesions for CLL pathogenesis in a subset of patients.","['Ojha, Juhi', 'Ayres, Jackline', 'Secreto, Charla', 'Tschumper, Renee', 'Rabe, Kari', 'Van Dyke, Daniel', 'Slager, Susan', 'Shanafelt, Tait', 'Fonseca, Rafael', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Braggio, Esteban']","['Ojha J', 'Ayres J', 'Secreto C', 'Tschumper R', 'Rabe K', 'Van Dyke D', 'Slager S', 'Shanafelt T', 'Fonseca R', 'Kay NE', 'Braggio E']","['Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ;', 'National Institute of Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ;', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ;']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",2014/11/08 06:00,2015/03/13 06:00,['2014/11/08 06:00'],"['2014/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35325-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-580563 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 15;125(3):492-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-580563.

Of 163 patients enrolled, 130 (median age, 45 years; range, 18-59 years) qualified for analysis, all achieving complete remission after treatment with SDAC (n = 78) or HDAC (n = 52) plus etoposide and daunorubicin. Consolidation consisted of intermediate-dose ARA-C and daunorubicin. MRD negativity was significantly more frequent in the SDAC vs. HDAC arm after both induction (37% vs. 15%, P = 0.007) and consolidation (44% vs. 18%, P = 0.002). Respective median residual leukemic cell counts with SDAC and HDAC use were 1.5 x 10(-3) and 4 x 10(-3) (P = 0.033) after induction and 5.7 x 10(-4) and 2.9 x 10(-3) (P = 0.008) after consolidation. Based on ARA-C schedule and post-consolidation MRD status, the four patient groups (SDAC-MRD(-) , HDAC-MRD(-) , SDAC-MRD(+) , and HDAC-MRD(+) ) displayed 5-year overall survival rates of 60%, 33%, 24%, and 42% (P = 0.007), respectively, with 24%, 35%, 74%, and 48% (P < 0.0001) respective cumulative incidence of relapse estimates. MRD may serve as a biomarker for optimal biologic dosing of ARA-C, and SDAC regimen appears to yield more frequent MRD negativity.","['Maurillo, Luca', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Sarlo, Chiara', 'Di Veroli, Ambra', 'Panetta, Paola', 'Irno-Consalvo, Maria', 'Nasso, Daniela', 'Ditto, Concetta', 'Refrigeri, Marco', 'De Angelis, Gottardo', 'Cerretti, Raffaella', 'Arcese, William', 'Sconocchia, Giuseppe', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Maurillo L', 'Buccisano F', 'Piciocchi A', 'Del Principe MI', 'Sarlo C', 'Di Veroli A', 'Panetta P', 'Irno-Consalvo M', 'Nasso D', 'Ditto C', 'Refrigeri M', 'De Angelis G', 'Cerretti R', 'Arcese W', 'Sconocchia G', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Amadori S', 'Venditti A']","['Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141124,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",2014/11/08 06:00,2015/03/20 06:00,['2014/11/08 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23893 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Feb;90(2):125-31. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23893.

We retrospectively evaluated serial blood counts over an 8-year period from 44 adult patients with sickle cell disease receiving hydroxycarbamide. Platelet counts, leucocyte counts, haemoglobin values and reticulocyte counts, apportioned by hydroxycarbamide status, were analysed using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram algorithm. Significant periodicities were present in one or more counts in 38 patients receiving hydroxycarbamide for a mean duration of 4.81 years. Platelet and leucocyte counts oscillated in 56.8% and 52.3% of patients, respectively. These oscillations generally became detectable within days of initiating therapy. During hydroxycarbamide therapy, the predominant periods of oscillation were 27 +/- 1 d for platelet counts and 15 +/- 1 d for leucocyte counts. Despite an absolute decrease in leucocyte and platelet counts during hydroxycarbamide treatment, the amplitudes between nadirs and zeniths remained similar regardless of exposure. Our observations appear consistent with previously proposed models of cyclic haematopoiesis, and document that hydroxycarbamide-induced oscillations in blood counts are innocuous phenomena not limited to myeloproliferative disorders as described previously. We speculate the known cell cycle inhibitory properties of hydroxycarbamide may accentuate otherwise latent constitutive oscillatory haematopoiesis.","['Baird, John H', 'Minniti, Caterina P', 'Lee, Jung-Min', 'Tian, Xin', 'Wu, Colin', 'Jackson, Mary', 'Alam, Shoaib', 'Taylor, James G 6th', 'Kato, Gregory J']","['Baird JH', 'Minniti CP', 'Lee JM', 'Tian X', 'Wu C', 'Jackson M', 'Alam S', 'Taylor JG 6th', 'Kato GJ']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20141106,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antisickling Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood/drug therapy', 'Antisickling Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Biological Clocks/*drug effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",2014/11/08 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2014/11/08 06:00'],"['2014/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13203 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Mar;168(5):737-46. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13203.

Therefore, interventions targeting the microbiota during mucositis might be interesting but can better be tested in animals than in vulnerable mucositis patients. Here, we aimed to study the potential microbial changes during methotrexate (MTX)-induced gastrointestinal mucositis in a well-established rat model and to study whether this model can be used for future microbial intervention studies. METHODS: After injection with MTX or saline (day 0), rats were sacrificed between days 2 and 11. Plasma citrulline level, jejunal histology, and the number and diversity of intestinal bacteria in feces (using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) were determined. RESULTS: Mucositis was most severe on day 4 when food intake, plasma citrulline, and villus length were the lowest, compared with controls (P < 0.0125). At the same time, MTX-treated rats showed an overall decrease (705-fold) in most bacteria (using a universal probe), compared with controls (P < 0.125). Reduced bacterial presence was related with the presence of diarrhea and a reduced villus length (rho = 0.38, P < 0.05). At day 4, there was an absolute and relative decrease of anaerobes (13-fold and -58 %, respectively) and streptococci (296-fold and -1 %, respectively) but a relative increase of Bacteroides (+49 %), compared with controls (P < 0.125). CONCLUSIONS: In the mucositis rat model, we found substantial decreases in the number and diversity of microbiota, resembling earlier findings in humans. The model therefore seems well suited to study the effects of different microbial interventions on mucositis, prior to performing human studies.","['Fijlstra, Margot', 'Ferdous, Mithila', 'Koning, Anne M', 'Rings, Edmond H H M', 'Harmsen, Hermie J M', 'Tissing, Wim J E']","['Fijlstra M', 'Ferdous M', 'Koning AM', 'Rings EH', 'Harmsen HJ', 'Tissing WJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands, m.fijlstra@amc.uva.nl.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141108,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['29VT07BGDA (Citrulline)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Citrulline/blood', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*drug effects/*microbiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Microbiota/*drug effects', 'Mucositis/blood/chemically induced/*microbiology', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2014/11/08 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2014/11/08 06:00'],"['2014/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2487-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2015 Jun;23(6):1513-22. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2487-6.

However non-relapse mortality (NRM) negates this benefit in older patients. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) permits SCT with reduced NRM, but its contribution to cure is uncertain. In the MRC AML15 Trial, patients in remission without favourable risk disease could receive SCT from a matched sibling or unrelated donor (MUD). If aged >45 years, a RIC was recommended and in patients aged 35-44 years, either RIC or myeloablative conditioning was permitted. The aim was to determine which approach improved survival and within which prespecified cytogenetic groups. RIC transplants significantly reduced relapse (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.66 (0.50-0.85), P=0.002) compared to chemotherapy The 5-year overall survival from a sibling RIC (61%) was superior to a MUD RIC (37%; adjusted HR 1.50 (1.01-2.21), P=0.04) due to lower NRM (34 vs 14%, P=0.002) In adjusted analyses, there was a survival benefit for sibling RIC over chemotherapy (59 vs 49%, HR 0.75 (0.57-0.97), P=0.03), with consistent results in intermediate and adverse-risk patients. In patients aged 35-44 years, best outcomes were seen with a sibling RIC transplant, although a comparison with chemotherapy and myeloablative transplant was not significant in adjusted analyses (P=0.3).","['Russell, N H', 'Kjeldsen, L', 'Craddock, C', 'Pagliuca, A', 'Yin, J A', 'Clark, R E', 'Howman, A', 'Hills, R K', 'Burnett, A K']","['Russell NH', 'Kjeldsen L', 'Craddock C', 'Pagliuca A', 'Yin JA', 'Clark RE', 'Howman A', 'Hills RK', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, Centre for Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospital, Nottingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Kings College Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool Hospital, Liverpool, UK.', 'School of Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141107,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Unrelated Donors']",2014/11/08 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2014/11/08 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014319 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.319 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1478-84. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.319.

Thereby, pro- and anti-angiogenic growth factors and cytokines regulate the angiogenic process. The most important growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its signaling through its receptors 1 and 2, is not only involved in solid tumours, but there is also emerging evidence that tumour progression in haematological malignancies also depends on the induction of new blood vessel formation. The evidence supporting this theory includes the finding of increased bone marrow microvessel density and increased levels of plasma pro-angiogenic cytokines. Leukaemia cells interact with surrounding host cells and extracellular matrix, this crosstalk affecting the most important aspects of the malignant phenotype. The pathophysiology of leukaemia induced angiogenesis involves both direct production of angiogenic cytokines by leukaemia cells and their interaction with bone marrow microenvironment. The inhibition of VEGF signalling by monoclonal antibodies or small molecules (kinase inhibitors) has already been successfully used for the treatment of different cancer entities, and multiple new drugs are being tested. This review summarises recent advances in the basic understanding of the role of angiogenesis in haematological malignancies and the translation of such basic findings into clinical studies.","['Medinger, Michael', 'Passweg, Jakob']","['Medinger M', 'Passweg J']","['Haematology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Haematology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141106,Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood supply/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2014/11/07 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/11/07 06:00'],"['2014/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4414/smw.2014.14050 [doi]', 'smw-14050 [pii]']",epublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2014 Nov 6;144:w14050. doi: 10.4414/smw.2014.14050. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cafestol, one of the major compounds in coffee beans, has been reported to have anti-carcinogenic activity and tumor cell growth-inhibitory activity, and we examined whether cafestol could overcome resistance against ABT-737 in Mcl-1-overexpressed human renal carcinoma Caki cells. ABT-737 alone had no effect on apoptosis, but cafestol markedly enhanced ABT-737-mediated apoptosis in Mcl-1-overexpressed Caki cells, human glioma U251MG cells, and human breast carcinoma MDA-MB231 cells. By contrast, co-treatment with ABT-737 and cafestol did not induce apoptosis in normal human skin fibroblast. Furthermore, combined treatment with cafestol and ABT-737 markedly reduced tumor growth compared with either drug alone in xenograft models. We found that cafestol inhibited Mcl-1 protein expression, which is important for ABT-737 resistance, through promotion of protein degradation. Moreover, cafestol increased Bim expression, and siRNA-mediated suppression of Bim expression reduced the apoptosis induced by cafestol plus ABT-737. Taken together, cafestol may be effectively used to enhance ABT-737 sensitivity in cancer therapy via downregulation of Mcl-1 expression and upregulation of Bim expression.","['Woo, S M', 'Min, K-J', 'Seo, B R', 'Nam, J-O', 'Choi, K S', 'Yoo, Y H', 'Kwon, T K']","['Woo SM', 'Min KJ', 'Seo BR', 'Nam JO', 'Choi KS', 'Yoo YH', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Ecological Environment Conservation, Kyungpook National University, Sangju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do 742-711, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Ajou University School of Medicine, 5 Woncheon-Dong, Paldal-Gu, Suwon 442-749, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and Mitochondria Hub Regulation Center, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan 602-714, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141106,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'AC465T6Q6W (cafestol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/11/07 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/11/07 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014472 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.472 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Nov 6;5:e1514. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.472.,,,,PMC4260730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML cells harbor a constellation of epigenetic modifications and regularly express large amounts of WT1 transcripts. Histone acetylation/methylation and DNA CpG methylation favor either exon skipping or inclusion, mainly through interfering with RNA Pol II-mediated elongation. This can result either from the binding of various factors on Pol II or alternatively from the recruitment of DNA binding factors that create roadblocks to Pol II-induced elongation. WT1 exhibits pleiotropic effects on mRNA splicing, which mainly result from the binding properties of WT1 via its zinc fingers domains to DNA, RNA, and proteins. Through the repression of the kinase SRPK1, WT1 modifies the splicing of VEGF, which plays important roles in hematopoiesis and angiogenesis. At the protein level, WT1 interacts with the splicing factors U2AF2, WTAP, and RPM4. Therefore, AML cells appear to have acquired numerous properties known to interfere with mRNA splicing. The challenge is now to elucidate these links in order to trigger mRNA splicing at the therapeutic level.","['Mohamed, Aminetou Mint', 'Thenoz, Morgan', 'Solly, Francoise', 'Balsat, Marie', 'Mortreux, Franck', 'Wattel, Eric']","['Mohamed AM', 'Thenoz M', 'Solly F', 'Balsat M', 'Mortreux F', 'Wattel E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",2014/11/07 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/07 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2304 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2304 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Oct 30;5(20):9534-45. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2304.,,,,PMC4259418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of S-1 in a recurrent colon cancer patient with CML treated with dasatinib. PATIENT: A 70-year-old man had undergone surgery three times for sigmoid colon cancer and recurrence. Systemic chemotherapy with S-1 plus oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab as a clinical trial had already been administered because of metastatic colon cancer. The patient's medical history was CML, and he had been receiving dasatinib treatment (100 mg once daily). Based on the diagnosis of unresectable and multiple metastases, S-1 monotherapy was started. S-1 (120 mg/day) was taken for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day rest. Blood samples were obtained before and after the first administration of S-1. The plasma pharmacokinetics of S-1 were comparable to a pharmacokinetics study of S-1. RESULTS: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-8) of tegafur (FT), 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP), oxonate (Oxo), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was 4,309.2, 716.3, 86.8, and 492.75 ng h/mL, respectively, after S-1 administration. The pharmacokinetics of FT, CDHP, Oxo, and 5-FU after treatment with S-1 were not significantly different from a phase I pharmacokinetics study of S-1. During treatment with S-1 and dasatinib, CML relapse and serious myelosuppression were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our report suggests that S-1 is an important treatment option for recurrent colorectal cancer in patients with CML treated with dasatinib.","['Sueda, Toshinori', 'Kudo, Toshihiro', 'Sakai, Daisuke', 'Uemura, Mamoru', 'Nishimura, Junichi', 'Hata, Taishi', 'Takemasa, Ichiro', 'Mizushima, Tsunekazu', 'Yamamoto, Hirofumi', 'Ezoe, Sachiko', 'Matsumoto, Kana', 'Doki, Yuichiro', 'Mori, Masaki', 'Satoh, Taroh']","['Sueda T', 'Kudo T', 'Sakai D', 'Uemura M', 'Nishimura J', 'Hata T', 'Takemasa I', 'Mizushima T', 'Yamamoto H', 'Ezoe S', 'Matsumoto K', 'Doki Y', 'Mori M', 'Satoh T']","['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20141106,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '150863-82-4 (S 1 (combination))', '1548R74NSZ (Tegafur)', '5VT6420TIG (Oxonic Acid)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Combinations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Oxonic Acid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Tegafur/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2014/11/07 06:00,2015/01/20 06:00,['2014/11/07 06:00'],"['2014/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2620-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Dec;74(6):1321-4. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2620-8.

A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was constructed in this study using data from 41 hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients conditioned with busulfan in combination with fludarabine (total dose 120 mg/m(2), Protocol 1519) or with fludarabine (total dose 250 mg/m(2)) with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG, Protocol 2041). METHODS: Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were fixed to post hoc Bayesian estimates, and circulating absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were obtained during the 3 weeks prior to graft infusion. A semi-physiological cell-kill model with three lymphocyte transit compartments was applied and aptly characterized the time course of suppression of circulating ALC by fludarabine administration. Drug- and system-specific parameters were estimated using a maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm, and the final model was qualified using an internal visual predictive check. RESULTS: The final model successfully characterized the time course and variability in ALC. Pharmacodynamic parameters exhibited considerable between subject variability (38.9-211 %). The HCT protocol was the only covariate associated with the pharmacodynamic parameters, specifically the lymphocyte kill rate, the transit rate between lymphocyte compartments, and the baseline ALC. CONCLUSIONS: This model can be used to simulate the degree of lymphosuppression for design of future fludarabine-based conditioning regimens.","['McCune, Jeannine S', 'Vicini, Paolo', 'Salinger, David H', ""O'Donnell, Paul V"", 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Mager, Donald E']","['McCune JS', 'Vicini P', 'Salinger DH', ""O'Donnell PV"", 'Sandmaier BM', 'Anasetti C', 'Mager DE']","['Department of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Box 357630, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA, jmccune@u.washington.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141106,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Half-Life', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/07 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/11/07 06:00'],"['2014/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2618-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Jan;75(1):67-75. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2618-2.

Furthermore, AML is a very heterogeneous disease, and studies of the prognostic impact of STAT3 in human AML have also given conflicting results. A more detailed characterization of STAT3 functions and the expression of various isoforms in human AML will therefore be required before it is possible to design clinical studies of STAT3 inhibitors in this disease, and it will be especially important to investigate whether the functions of STAT3 differ between patients.

Long-term follow-up data are now available in the adult population, and the toxicity profile of imatinib mesylate among adults has been extensively studied and reported. Despite its increasing use in the pediatric population, there are limited data regarding adverse event profiles of imatinib mesylate in children, and few reports exist in the literature focusing on nonhematologic toxicity in this population. We reviewed our institutional experience with imatinib therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia over an 8-year period of time. Nine pediatric patients began therapy with imatinib mesylate and were included in this review. We reviewed the occurrence of nonhematologic toxicity in this cohort and the impact of that toxicity on continuation of therapy. Eight patients experienced nonhematologic toxicity, including nausea/vomiting (44.4%) and musculoskeletal pain (88.9%). Three patients (33.3%) required discontinuation of imatinib therapy due to grade 3/4 musculoskeletal pain, a rate that is significantly higher than that seen in the adult population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of 159 ALL childhood cases were reviewed. The patients were divided into the hyperglycemia group (fasting glucose>/=126 mg/dl and/or random blood glucose>/=200 mg/dl) and the euglycemia group according to the blood glucose values. The ?2 test was performed to compare the complete remission rates of the two groups, and Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were performed to compare the 5-year overall and relapse-free survival. RESULTS: The incidence of hyperglycemia in the age>/=10-year-old group was higher than the younger-age group (P=0.009). Values in the interim- and high-risk groups were higher than the standard-risk group (P=0.028), while there was no significant difference between genders (P=0.056). The complete remission rates of the 2 groups demonstrated no significant difference (P=0.134), while the 5-year OS of the hyperglycemia group was lower than in the euglycemia group (83.8+/-6.0% vs 94.9+/-2.4%, P=0.014). The 5 -year RFS was significantly lower than the euglycemia group (62.9+/-8.7%) vs 80.2+/-9.1%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with age>/=10 years old, and in the middle- and high-risk groups appear prone to complicating hyperglycemia during inductive chemotherapy, associated with lower 5-year OS and RFS.","['Zhang, Bi-Hong', 'Wang, Jian', 'Xue, Hong-Man', 'Chen, Chun']","['Zhang BH', 'Wang J', 'Xue HM', 'Chen C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China E-mail : cnChunCHEN@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,['0 (Blood Glucose)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2014/11/07 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/11/07 06:00'],"['2014/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.20.8855 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(20):8855-9. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.20.8855.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally, ZNF282 is known to bind U5RE (U5 repressive element) of HLTV-1 (human T cell leukemia virus type 1) with a repressive effect. Recently we reported that ZNF282 functions as an estrogen receptor co-activator and plays an essential role in breast tumorigenesis. Although these results suggest the possible role of ZNF282 in cancers, clinical significance and function of ZNF282 are completely unknown in most of cancers. Here we found that ZNF282 was frequently overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (n=165) compared with normal esophageal epithelium and its overexpression was correlated with adverse clinical outcome. Multivariate survival analysis indicated that ZNF282 expression was an independent prognostic predictor for poor survival in ESCC (HR: 2.56 (95% CI 1.54-4.26), p<0.001). In addition, depletion of ZNF282 inhibited the cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells and reduced the tumorigenicity of ESCC xenograft in nude mouse. We further showed that ZNF282 is required for E2F1-mediated gene expression in ESCC cells. Thus, ZNF282 is E2F1 co-activator involved in ESCC and elevated expression of ZNF282 is an independent adverse prognostic factor in ESCC.","['Yeo, So-Young', 'Ha, Sang Yun', 'Yu, Eun Ji', 'Lee, Keun-Woo', 'Kim, Jeong Hoon', 'Kim, Seok-Hyung']","['Yeo SY', 'Ha SY', 'Yu EJ', 'Lee KW', 'Kim JH', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.

A retrospective single-center analysis was performed on patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), aged </=20 years, who had received an 8-Gy TBI/FLU/CY RTMAC regimen followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).

HT93A cells were cultured with or without nilotinib+/-50 ng/mL of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Nilotinib treatment inhibited cell growth by increasing the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase through the decrease of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Y705), STAT5 (Y694) and c-Myc expression. After stimulation with G-CSF, STAT5 but not STAT3 was significantly phosphorylated in both nilotinib-treated and untreated cells. Moreover, combination therapy with nilotinib and G-CSF returned the expression level of c-Myc, cell growth and cell cycle distribution to the control level. These findings suggest that the ETV6/ARG oncoprotein contributes to autonomous cell growth by compensating for the requirement of growth factor through activating STAT5 signaling, which leads to the up-regulation of c-Myc.

Overexpression of miR107 in K562 and KCL22 chronic myeloid leukemia cells promotes erythroid differentiation, while having no effect on cell proliferation. Further bioinformatics predicted that one target of miR107 may be Cacna2d1, a calcium channel protein. A luciferase reporter assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were utilized to confirm that Cacna2d1 is a target molecule of miR-107. The effect of miR107 on K562 and KCL22 cells was mediated through the downregulation of Cacna2d1, as rescued expression of Cacna2d1 reversed the effects of miR107.

In the present study, the anti-tumor activity of the ethanolic extract of Forsythia suspensa root (FSREE) against esophageal carcinoma cells was investigated in vitro and in vivo and its anti-cancer mechanism was examined. The results revealed that FSREE, rather than Forsythia suspensa ethanolic extracts from the leaf (FSLEE) and fruit (FSFEE) exhibited marked anti-tumor activity towards human esophageal cancer cells. FSREE induced cancer cell apoptosis and growth arrest by downregulating Bcell lymphoma (Bcl)2, Bclextra large and myeloid cell leukemia 1, while upregulating Bcl2associated X protein, Bcl2 antagonist of cell death and phorbol12myristate13acetateinduced protein 1. This led to the activation of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase, caspase3 and caspase9, but not caspase8. Furthermore, the anti-cancer activity of FSREE was associated with a decreased level of phosphorylated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and extracellularsignalregulated kinase signaling activity. It was also observed that the levels of cytochrome c were elevated in the cytoplasm, accounting for the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in the TE13 cells upon treatment with FSEER. In addition, FSEER inhibited the growth of esophageal cancer cells in xenograft models and no detectable toxicity was present in the lung or liver tissues. These observations provided further evidence of the anti-tumor effect of FSEER and may be of importance to further examine the potential role of Forsythia suspensa root as a therapeutic agent in esophageal carcinoma therapy.","['Zhao, Lianmei', 'Yan, Xi', 'Shi, Juan', 'Ren, Fengzhi', 'Liu, Lihua', 'Sun, Shiping', 'Shan, Baoen']","['Zhao L', 'Yan X', 'Shi J', 'Ren F', 'Liu L', 'Sun S', 'Shan B']","['Research Center, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050011, P.R.

CXCL12 binds specifically to the G-protein-coupled receptor CXCR4 to induce the migration of primordial germ cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and inflammation-associated immune cells. In addition, CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling is often enhanced in malignant tumor cells and facilitates increased proliferation as well as metastasis. Although macrophage migration inhibitory factor and extracellular ubiquitin interact with CXCR4 as agonistic factors, CXCL12 was believed to be the sole chemokine ligand for CXCR4. However, a very recent report revealed that CXCL14 binds to CXCR4 with high affinity and efficiently inhibits CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis of hematopoietic progenitor and leukemia-derived cells. CXCL14 does not directly cross-compete with CXCL12 for the CXCR4 binding but instead inactivates CXCR4 via receptor internalization. Because both CXCL12 and CXCL14 are expressed during embryogenesis and brain development in mice, these two chemokines could function in an interactive fashion. We propose that the CXCL14 gene has been conserved from fish to man due to its role in fine-tuning the strength of CXCL12-mediated signal transduction. In addition to its biological implications, the above finding will be important for designing anti-cancer compounds targeting the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis. In fact, a stabilized dimeric peptide containing the C-terminal 51-77 amino acid residues of CXCL14 has been shown to have stronger CXCL12 antagonistic activity than full-length CXCL14.","['Hara, Takahiko', 'Tanegashima, Kosuke']","['Hara T', 'Tanegashima K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Germany,Biomol Concepts,Biomolecular concepts,101518829,"['0 (CXCL14 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemokine CXCL12/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Chemokines, CXC/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/bmc-2014-0007 [doi]', '/j/bmc.2014.5.issue-2/bmc-2014-0007/bmc-2014-0007.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Biomol Concepts. 2014 May;5(2):167-73. doi: 10.1515/bmc-2014-0007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, the most effective therapy for CML is bone marrow transplantation, but this procedure is expensive, and it is often difficult to find appropriately matched bone marrow donors. As an alternative to marrow transplantation, a more effective anticancer drug should be developed to cure the disease; in addition, an effective system to evaluate the activity of the drug needs to be developed. Herein, we present a novel antileukemia drug evaluation method based on a multisignal amplified photoelectrochemical sensing platform that monitors the activity of caspase-3, a known marker of cell apoptosis. Manganese-doped CdS@ZnS core-shell nanoparticles (Mn:CdS@ZnS) were synthesized via a simple wet chemical method, which provided a stable photocurrent signal. A DEVD-biotin peptide and streptavidin-labeled alkaline phosphatise (SA-ALP) were immobilized successively at these nanoparticles through amide bonding and through specific interaction between biotin and streptavidin, respectively. The photocurrent of this sensing platform improved as the ALP hydrolyzed the substrate 2-phospho-l-ascorbic acid (AAP) to ascorbic acid (AA), a more efficient electron donor. The activity of caspase-3 was detected using this sensing platform, and thus, the efficacy of nilotinib for targeting K562 CML cells could be evaluated. The results indicate that nilotinib can effectively induce apoptosis of the K562 cells. This sensing platform exhibited sensitive, reproductive, and stable performance in studying the nilotinib-induced apoptosis of K562 CML cells, and the platform could be utilized to evaluate other anticancer drugs.","['Zhou, Shiwei', 'Kong, Yong', 'Shen, Qingming', 'Ren, Xiaolin', 'Zhang, Jian-Rong', 'Zhu, Jun-Jie']","['Zhou S', 'Kong Y', 'Shen Q', 'Ren X', 'Zhang JR', 'Zhu JJ']","[""State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University , Nanjing 210093, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141118,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/instrumentation/*methods', '*Electrochemical Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Photochemical Processes', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac502969x [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2014 Dec 2;86(23):11680-9. doi: 10.1021/ac502969x.

METHODS: Two patients complained of sudden bilateral visual loss and dyschromatopsia. Both suffered from acute myelocytic leukemia with severe aplastic anemia and were treated with intravenous deferoxamine for 1 month. First ophthalmologic exploration and follow-up included fundoscopic examination, fluorescence angiography, fundus autofluorescence, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: Initially, both patients presented with a decreased visual acuity, inferior to 20/100. Fundus examination revealed a loss of transparency of the outer retina in the two cases. Autofluorescence pictures displayed hypoautofluorescence in the macular area, whereas fluorescein angiography unveiled an annular hyperfluorescence staining in the macular zone. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography showed a serous detachment of the neuroepithelium associated with photoreceptor outer segment elongation. Deferoxamine toxicity was immediately suspected and therapy promptly interrupted. One week later, both patients recovered visual acuity of 20/20 but retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mottling was noticed in the macular areas. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography monitoring showed a progressive resolution of serous retinal detachment. Elongation of the photoreceptor outer segment disappeared but the RPE remained thickened, interrupted, and fragmented at different macular loci. CONCLUSION: Serous detachment of the neuroepithelium associated with photoreceptor outer segment elongation in the early stage of deferoxamine maculopathy is described for the first time. Early drug discontinuation allowed a fast resolution of the serous detachment but the typical RPE pigment mottling observed at the resolution phase was noticed 1 week later.","['Van Bol, Laure', 'Alami, Anas', 'Benghiat, Fleur S', 'Rasquin, Florence']","['Van Bol L', 'Alami A', 'Benghiat FS', 'Rasquin F']","['Departments of *Ophthalmology, and daggerHematology, Erasme Hospital, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,"['0 (Siderophores)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Deferoxamine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Retinal Degeneration/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Siderophores/*adverse effects', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence/methods']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/06/25 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/ICB.0000000000000013 [doi]', '01271216-201400820-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2014 Spring;8(2):97-102. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0000000000000013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective case report. RESULTS: A 72-year-old woman with known T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia treated with a course of alemtuzumab presented to our department with a VH in her left eye after a fall. An initial diagnosis of hemorrhagic posterior vitreous detachment was made. However, as the VH was resolving, she was found to have underlying vitritis, occlusive vasculitis, and a pale optic nerve head. Vitreous biopsy confirmed cytomegalovirus retinitis. Despite treatment with intravenous foscarnet and oral valganciclovir, her vision continued to remain poor because of the severe damage from the retinal vasculitis and residual VH. CONCLUSION: As indications for immunosuppression increase, the incidence of cytomegalovirus retinitis in non-HIV-immunosuppressed patients is expected to rise. Therefore, in this subgroup of patients, we should be aware of any underlying retinitis especially in cases with an unusual presentation of VH.","[""Ch'ng, Soon Wai"", 'Brent, Alexander', 'Banerjee, Somnath']","[""Ch'ng SW"", 'Brent A', 'Banerjee S']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals of Leicester, Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis/*complications/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vitreous Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*etiology']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/06/25 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/ICB.0000000000000002 [doi]', '01271216-201400810-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2014 Winter;8(1):50-1. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0000000000000002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While high levels of CD3+ cells in grafts can contribute to GVHD, they also promote the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. Infusions of extra lymphocytes from the original stem cell donor can be used as a treatment after transplantation for relapse or poor immune reconstitution but also they increase the risk for GVHD. In peripheral blood, 95% of T-cells express the alphabeta T-cell receptor and the remaining T-cells express the gammadelta T-cell receptor. As alphabeta T-cells are the primary mediators of GVHD, depleting them from the graft should reduce this risk. In this pilot study, five patients transplanted with HLA-matched related and unrelated donors were treated with alphabeta T-cell depleted stem cell boosts. The majority of gammadelta T-cells in the grafts expressed Vdelta2 and/or Vgamma9. Most patients receiving alphabeta-depleted stem cell boosts increased their levels of white blood cells, platelets, and/or granulocytes 30 days after infusion. No signs of GVHD or other side effects were detected. A larger pool of patients with longer follow-up time is needed to confirm the data in this study.","['Radestad, E', 'Wikell, H', 'Engstrom, M', 'Watz, E', 'Sundberg, B', 'Thunberg, S', 'Uzunel, M', 'Mattsson, J', 'Uhlin, M']","['Radestad E', 'Wikell H', 'Engstrom M', 'Watz E', 'Sundberg B', 'Thunberg S', 'Uzunel M', 'Mattsson J', 'Uhlin M']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden ; Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141013,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Rejection/etiology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/578741 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol Res. 2014;2014:578741. doi: 10.1155/2014/578741.

These patients are often denied treatment for fear of treatment-related death. We present the first Jehovah's Witness patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated successfully with azacitidine. After achieving complete remission (CR) with one course of azacitidine therapy, the patient received conventional postremission chemotherapy and remained in CR. In the case of patients who accept blood transfusions, there are reports indicating the treatment of AML patients with azacitidine. In these reports, azacitidine therapy was less toxic, including hematoxicity, compared with conventional chemotherapy. The CR rate in azacitidine-treated patients was inadequate; however, some characteristics could be useful in predicting azacitidine responders. The present case is useful for treating Jehovah's Witnesses patients with AML and provides a clue for anti-AML therapy requiring minimum blood transfusions.","['Yamamoto, Yumi', 'Kawashima, Akihito', 'Kashiwagi, Eri', 'Ogata, Kiyoyuki']","['Yamamoto Y', 'Kawashima A', 'Kashiwagi E', 'Ogata K']","['Metropolitan Research Center for Blood Disorders (MRC Japan), 1-45-46 Midorigaoka, Chofu, Tokyo 182-0001, Japan.', 'Department of General Medicine, Shin-Yurigaoka General Hospital, Furusawa Tsuko 255, Asaoku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 215-0026, Japan ; Department of Hematology, Shin-Yurigaoka General Hospital, Furusawa Tsuko 255, Asaoku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 215-0026, Japan.', 'Metropolitan Research Center for Blood Disorders (MRC Japan), 1-45-46 Midorigaoka, Chofu, Tokyo 182-0001, Japan ; Department of Hematology, Shin-Yurigaoka General Hospital, Furusawa Tsuko 255, Asaoku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 215-0026, Japan.', 'Metropolitan Research Center for Blood Disorders (MRC Japan), 1-45-46 Midorigaoka, Chofu, Tokyo 182-0001, Japan ; Department of Hematology, Shin-Yurigaoka General Hospital, Furusawa Tsuko 255, Asaoku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 215-0026, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141002,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2014/11/06 06:00,2014/11/06 06:01,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/141260 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2014;2014:141260. doi: 10.1155/2014/141260.

METHODS: The relationship between orally administered voriconazole, plasma concentrations and liver toxicity was examined in a cohort of 69 primarily acute leukemia patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: Oral administration of voriconazole was associated with significant interpatient variability, with voriconazole steady-state concentrations ranging from 0 mug/mL to 16.6 mug/mL. Approximately 20% of patients achieved steady-state concentrations <1 mug/mL. When adjusted for weight, patients receiving higher voriconazole doses tended toward higher plasma concentrations; however, there was no significant relationship between the plasma concentration and genotype, age, sex or use of concomitant proton pump inhibitors. Voriconazole concentrations were correlated with higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels at day 6 to 8, and with higher bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase levels at day 14 to 16, but not with other liver enzyme levels. CONCLUSION: In ill patients with acute leukemia and related disorders undergoing treatment with oral voriconazole, there is a poor correlation between the voriconazole dose and plasma concentrations, and many patients achieve levels that are considered to be subtherapeutic. The findings support the routine use of therapeutic drug monitoring in these patients.","['Saini, Lalit', 'Seki, Jack T', 'Kumar, Deepali', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Cole, David Ec', 'Wong, Betty Yl', 'Bozovic, Andrea', 'Brandwein, Joseph M']","['Saini L', 'Seki JT', 'Kumar D', 'Atenafu EG', 'Cole DE', 'Wong BY', 'Bozovic A', 'Brandwein JM']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta;', 'Department of Pharmacy, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre; ; Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario;', 'Transplant Infectious Diseases, Alberta Transplant Institute; ; University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta;', 'Biostatistics Department, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathophysiology and Department of Clinical Pathology, University of Toronto; ; Department of Clinical Pathology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre;', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre;', 'Laboratory Medicine Program, Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network; ; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Egypt,Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale,101226876,,,,2014/11/06 06:00,2014/11/06 06:01,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/214813 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol. 2014 Sep;25(5):271-6. doi: 10.1155/2014/214813.,['NOTNLM'],"['Antifungals', 'Drug levels', 'Liver toxicity', 'Voriconazole']",,PMC4211351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genome-wide sequencing has uncovered novel mutations in the splicing factor sf3b1, that were in part associated with ATM aberrations, suggesting functional synergy. We first performed detailed genetic analyses in a CLL cohort (n=110) containing ATM, SF3B1 and TP53 gene defects. Next, we applied a newly developed multiplex assay for p53/ATM target gene induction and measured apoptotic responses to DNA damage. Interestingly, SF3B1 mutated samples without concurrent ATM and TP53 aberrations (sole SF3B1) displayed partially defective ATM/p53 transcriptional and apoptotic responses to various DNA-damaging regimens. In contrast, NOTCH1 or K/N-RAS mutated CLL displayed normal responses in p53/ATM target gene induction and apoptosis. In sole SF3B1 mutated cases, ATM kinase function remained intact, and gammaH2AX formation, a marker for DNA damage, was increased at baseline and upon irradiation. Our data demonstrate that single mutations in sf3b1 are associated with increased DNA damage and/or an aberrant response to DNA damage. Together, our observations may offer an explanation for the poor prognosis associated with SF3B1 mutations.","['Te Raa, G D', 'Derks, I A M', 'Navrkalova, V', 'Skowronska, A', 'Moerland, P D', 'van Laar, J', 'Oldreive, C', 'Monsuur, H', 'Trbusek, M', 'Malcikova, J', 'Loden, M', 'Geisler, C H', 'Hullein, J', 'Jethwa, A', 'Zenz, T', 'Pospisilova, S', 'Stankovic, T', 'van Oers, M H J', 'Kater, A P', 'Eldering, E']","['Te Raa GD', 'Derks IA', 'Navrkalova V', 'Skowronska A', 'Moerland PD', 'van Laar J', 'Oldreive C', 'Monsuur H', 'Trbusek M', 'Malcikova J', 'Loden M', 'Geisler CH', 'Hullein J', 'Jethwa A', 'Zenz T', 'Pospisilova S', 'Stankovic T', 'van Oers MH', 'Kater AP', 'Eldering E']","['1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany [2] Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141105,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genome, Human', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014318 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.318 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1133-42. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.318.

Here we first evaluated its incidence, risk factors and outcome in 233 consecutive transplants from partially HLA-mismatched related and unrelated donors (MMRD and MMUD, respectively). We documented 84 relapses, 23 of which with HLA loss. All the HLA loss relapses occurred after MMRD HSCT, and 20/23 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Upon MMRD HSCT, HLA loss variants accounted for 33% of the relapses (23/69), occurring later than their 'classical' counterparts (median: 307 vs 88 days, P<0.0001). Active disease at HSCT increased the risk of HLA loss (hazard ratio (HR): 10.16; confidence interval (CI): 2.65-38.92; P=0.001), whereas older patient ages had a protective role (HR: 0.16; CI: 0.05-0.46; P=0.001). A weaker association with HLA loss was observed for graft T-cell dose and occurrence of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Outcome after 'classical' and HLA loss relapses was similarly poor, and second transplantation from a different donor appeared to provide a slight advantage for survival. In conclusion, HLA loss is a frequent mechanism of evasion from T-cell alloreactivity and relapse in patients with myeloid malignancies transplanted from MMRDs, warranting routine screening in this transplantation setting.","['Crucitti, L', 'Crocchiolo, R', 'Toffalori, C', 'Mazzi, B', 'Greco, R', 'Signori, A', 'Sizzano, F', 'Chiesa, L', 'Zino, E', 'Lupo Stanghellini, M T', 'Assanelli, A',

The Kras2(LSL)Mx1-Cre (KM) mouse model expresses endogenous KRAS(G12D) in hematopoietic cells and is widely used to study mechanisms and treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The model displays an intriguing shift from MPN to acute T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) after transplantation to wild-type mice, but the mechanisms underlying this lineage shift is unknown. Here, we show that KRAS(G12D) increases proliferation of both myeloid and T-cell progenitors, but whereas myeloid cells differentiate, T-cell differentiation is inhibited at early stages. Secondary mutations in the expanded pool of T-cell progenitors accompany T-ALL development, and our results indicate that the shift from myeloid to T-lymphoid malignancy after transplantation is explained by the increased likelihood for secondary mutations when the tumor lifespan is increased. We demonstrate that tumor lifespan increases after transplantation because primary KM mice die rapidly, not from MPN, but from KRAS(G12D) expression in nonhematopoietic cells, which causes intestinal bleeding and severe anemia. We also identify loss of the wild-type KRAS allele as a secondary mutation in all T-ALL cells and provide evidence that wild-type KRAS acts as a tumor suppressor in the T-cell lineage in mice.","['Staffas, A', 'Karlsson, C', 'Persson, M', 'Palmqvist, L', 'Bergo, M O']","['Staffas A', 'Karlsson C', 'Persson M', 'Palmqvist L', 'Bergo MO']","['1] Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden [2] Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141105,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (KRAS4B protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Anemia/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, ras', 'Genotype', 'Hemoglobins/chemistry', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mice', 'Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014315 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.315 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1032-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.315.

To further explore the utility of DNMT3A mutations as biomarkers for AML, we developed assays for sensitive detection of recurrent mutations affecting residue R882. Analysis of DNA from 298 diagnostic AML samples revealed DNMT3A mutations in 45 cases (15%), which coincided with mutations in NPM1, FLT3 and IDH1. DNMT3A mutations were stable in 12 of 13 patients presenting with relapse or secondary myelodysplastic syndrome, but were also present in remission samples from 14 patients (at allele frequencies of <1-50%) up to 8 years after initial AML diagnosis, despite the loss of all other molecular AML markers. The mutant DNMT3A allele burden was not related to the clinical course of disease. Cell sorting demonstrated the presence of DNMT3A mutations in leukaemic blasts, but also at lower allele frequencies in T and B-cells from the same patients. Our data are consistent with the recent finding of preleukaemic stem cells in AML, which are resistant to chemotherapy. The persistence of DNMT3A mutations during remission may have important implications for the management of AML.","['Ploen, Gro G', 'Nederby, Line', 'Guldberg, Per', 'Hansen, Maria', 'Ebbesen, Lene H', 'Jensen, Uffe Birk', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Aggerholm, Anni']","['Ploen GG', 'Nederby L', 'Guldberg P', 'Hansen M', 'Ebbesen LH', 'Jensen UB', 'Hokland P', 'Aggerholm A']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140804,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alleles', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13062 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Nov;167(4):478-86. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13062.

Some of the newly discovered LSC markers seem to be expressed in a disease-specific manner and may thus serve as major research tools and diagnostic parameters. A useful LSC marker in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) appears to be CD26, also known as dipeptidylpeptidase IV. Expression of CD26 is largely restricted to CD34(+) /CD38(-) LSCs in BCR/ABL1(+) CML, but is not found on LSCs in other myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms, with the exception of lymphoid blast crisis of CML, BCR/ABL1p210 + acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and a very few cases of acute myeloid leukaemia. Moreover, CD26 usually is not expressed on normal bone marrow (BM) stem cells.

Ten multipoint mutant genes were obtained, and five recombinant RrA variants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and isolated as functionally active highly purified proteins. Protein purification was performed using Q-Sepharose and DEAE-Toyopearl chromatography. Overall yield of the active enzymes was 70-80 %, their specific activity at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C varied of 140-210 U/mg. L-Glutaminase activity did not exceed 0.01 % of L-asparaginase activity. All RrA mutants showed maximum enzyme activity at pH 9.3-9.5 and 53-58 degrees C. Km and Vmax values for L-asparagine were evaluated for all mutants.

This transition is often preceded by a clinically recognized, but biologically poorly characterized, accelerated phase (AP). Here, we report that IKAROS protein is absent or reduced in bone marrow blasts from most CML patients with advanced myeloid disease (AP or BC). This contrasts with primitive CP-CML cells and BCR-ABL1-negative acute myeloid leukemia blasts, which express readily detectable IKAROS. To investigate whether loss of IKAROS contributes to myeloid disease progression in CP-CML, we examined the effects of forced expression of a dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS (IK6) in CP-CML patients' CD34(+) cells. We confirmed that IK6 disrupts IKAROS activity in transduced CP-CML cells and showed that it confers on them features of AP-CML, including a prolonged increased output in vitro and in xenografted mice of primitive cells with an enhanced ability to differentiate into basophils. Expression of IK6 in CD34(+) CP-CML cells also led to activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and transcriptional repression of its negative regulators. These findings implicate loss of IKAROS as a frequent step and potential diagnostic harbinger of progressive myeloid disease in CML patients.","['Beer, Philip A', 'Knapp, David J H F', 'Miller, Paul H', 'Kannan, Nagarajan', 'Sloma, Ivan', 'Heel, Kathy', 'Babovic, Sonja', 'Bulaeva, Elizabeth', 'Rabu, Gabrielle', 'Terry, Jefferson', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Loeb, Keith R', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Erber, Wendy N', 'Eaves, Connie J']","['Beer PA', 'Knapp DJ', 'Miller PH', 'Kannan N', 'Sloma I', 'Heel K', 'Babovic S', 'Bulaeva E', 'Rabu G', 'Terry J', 'Druker BJ', 'Loriaux MM', 'Loeb KR', 'Radich JP', 'Erber WN', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Paul Brousse, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM U935, Villejuif, France;"", 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Crawley WA, Australia;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University Medical Centre, Hamilton, ON, Canada;', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; and.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; and.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Crawley WA, Australia;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Ikaros 6 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Basophils/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/03/13 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35327-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-581173 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 15;125(3):504-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-581173.

Here we report a Shh-induced epigenetic switch that cooperates with Gli to control transcription outcomes. Before induction, poised Shh target genes are marked by a bivalent chromatin domain containing a repressive histone H3K27me3 mark and an active H3K4me3 mark. Shh activation induces a local switch of epigenetic cofactors from the H3K27 methyltransferase polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to an H3K27me3 demethylase Jmjd3/Kdm6b-centred coactivator complex. We also find that non-enzymatic activities of Jmjd3 are important and that Jmjd3 recruits the Set1/MLL H3K4 methyltransferase complexes in a Shh-dependent manner to resolve the bivalent domain. In vivo, changes of the bivalent domain accompanied Shh-activated cerebellar progenitor proliferation. Overall, our results reveal a regulatory mechanism that underlies the activation of Shh target genes and provides insight into the causes of various diseases and cancers exhibiting altered Shh signalling.","['Shi, Xuanming', 'Zhang, Zilai', 'Zhan, Xiaoming', 'Cao, Mou', 'Satoh, Takashi', 'Akira, Shizuo', 'Shpargel, Karl', 'Magnuson, Terry', 'Li, Qingtian', 'Wang, Rongfu', 'Wang, Chaochen', 'Ge, Kai', 'Wu, Jiang']","['Shi X', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhan X', 'Cao M', 'Satoh T', 'Akira S', 'Shpargel K', 'Magnuson T', 'Li Q', 'Wang R', 'Wang C', 'Ge K', 'Wu J']","['Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.', 'Laboratory of Host Defense, World Premier Institute Immunology Frontier Research Center and Department of Host Defense, RIMD, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Host Defense, World Premier Institute Immunology Frontier Research Center and Department of Host Defense, RIMD, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.', 'Center for Inflammation and Epigenetics, The Methodist Hospital Research Institute, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Center for Inflammation and Epigenetics, The Methodist Hospital Research Institute, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141105,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Gli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Shh protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (Kdm6b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellum/growth & development', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Medulloblastoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",2014/11/06 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms6425 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms6425 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Nov 5;5:5425. doi: 10.1038/ncomms6425.,,,"['R01 GM101974/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD024462/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 MH102820/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R21MH102820/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5232137,['NIHMS837507'],,,,,,,,,"['Competing financial interests: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,

The protooncogene c-Myc (Myc) is a critical target of Notch in normal and malignant pre-T cells, but how Notch regulates Myc is unknown. Here, we identify a distal enhancer located >1 Mb 3' of human and murine Myc that binds Notch transcription complexes and physically interacts with the Myc proximal promoter. The Notch1 binding element in this region activates reporter genes in a Notch-dependent, cell-context-specific fashion that requires a conserved Notch complex binding site. Acute changes in Notch activation produce rapid changes in H3K27 acetylation across the entire enhancer (a region spanning >600 kb) that correlate with Myc expression. This broad Notch-influenced region comprises an enhancer region containing multiple domains, recognizable as discrete H3K27 acetylation peaks. Leukemia cells selected for resistance to Notch inhibitors express Myc despite epigenetic silencing of enhancer domains near the Notch transcription complex binding sites. Notch-independent expression of Myc in resistant cells is highly sensitive to inhibitors of bromodomain containing 4 (Brd4), a change in drug sensitivity that is accompanied by preferential association of the Myc promoter with more 3' enhancer domains that are strongly dependent on Brd4 for function. These findings indicate that altered long-range enhancer activity can mediate resistance to targeted therapies and provide a mechanistic rationale for combined targeting of Notch and Brd4 in leukemia.","['Yashiro-Ohtani, Yumi', 'Wang, Hongfang', 'Zang, Chongzhi', 'Arnett, Kelly L', 'Bailis, Will', 'Ho, Yugong', 'Knoechel, Birgit', 'Lanauze, Claudia', 'Louis, Lumena', 'Forsyth, Katherine S', 'Chen, Sujun', 'Chung, Yoonjie', 'Schug, Jonathan', 'Blobel, Gerd A', 'Liebhaber, Stephen A', 'Bernstein, Bradley E', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Liu, Xiaole Shirley', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Yashiro-Ohtani Y', 'Wang H', 'Zang C', 'Arnett KL', 'Bailis W', 'Ho Y', 'Knoechel B', 'Lanauze C', 'Louis L', 'Forsyth KS', 'Chen S', 'Chung Y', 'Schug J', 'Blobel GA', 'Liebhaber SA', 'Bernstein BE', 'Blacklow SC', 'Liu XS', 'Aster JC', 'Pear WS']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;"", 'Departments of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Department of Genetics, and.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;"", 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China 200092.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Department of Genetics, and.', ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104;"", 'Department of Genetics, and.', 'Broad Institute and Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115; and.', 'Departments of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; wpear@mail.med.upenn.edu jaster@partners.org."", 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and wpear@mail.med.upenn.edu jaster@partners.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141104,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Brd4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RBPJ protein, human)', '0 (Rbpj protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genes, myc', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptor, Notch1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2014/11/06 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1407079111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1407079111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Nov 18;111(46):E4946-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1407079111.

However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been illustrated. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and epigenetic regulation of PLZF as well as its clinical significance in HCC. We found that the expression of PLZF was significantly downregulated in HCC samples at both the RNA level (P<0.001) and protein level compared with these levels in adjacent normal tissues. The relative expression level of PLZF was also positively correlated with the ALP level (P=0.026) noted in the HCC patients. However, hypermethylation was only detected in one out of 5 paired HCC samples, indicating that methylation of the selected promoter region (from -1702 to -1388) may not be the major regulatory mechanism for the downregulation of PLZF in HCC. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created to evaluate the diagnostic value for differentiating between HCC and benign diseases. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for indicating the value of PLZF as an HCC biomarker was 0.794 (95% CI, 0.697-0.892; P<0.001). Taken together, our results suggest that PLZF may play an important role in HCC development and may be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC.","['Hui, Anselm Wang-Hei', 'Lau, Hon-Wai', 'Cao, Cyanne Ye', 'Zhou, Jun-Wei', 'Lai, Paul Bo-San', 'Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing']","['Hui AW', 'Lau HW', 'Cao CY', 'Zhou JW', 'Lai PB', 'Tsui SK']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong, SAR, P.R.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the levels of cytokines (osteopontin and angiopoietins 1 and 2) active in the bone marrow niche during the mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells for autologous transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients (24 females, 24 males), median age 56.5 years, entered the study. The group consisted of patients with multiple myeloma (n=34), lymphoma (n=13) and acute myeloid leukaemia (n=1). Blood samples were collected before chemotherapy and on the day of the first apheresis. Cytokines were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Additionally, circulating endothelial cells were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The median concentration of angiopoietin 1 at the time of apheresis was lower than that at baseline (2.7 vs 7.8 ng/mL, p<0.001). In contrast, the median level of angiopoietin 2 increased during the mobilisation procedure (3.6 vs 2.8 ng/mL, p=0.001). The patients were divided according to the number of days of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment before the first apheresis into ""early"" (<median=11 days) and ""late"" (>median) mobilisers. The group of ""early mobilisers"" had higher baseline angiopoietin 1 levels (median=11.6 ng/mL) than those of the ""late mobilisers"" (median=6.0 ng/mL, p=0.05). An adverse correlation was observed between duration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment and baseline angiopoietin 1 level. Baseline angiopoietin 1 levels correlated with numbers of circulating endothelial cells. Low angiopoietin 2 level increased the chance of poor mobilisation. CONCLUSIONS: The angiogenic processes can influence the timing of mobilisation. Angiopoietins 1 and 2 need further evaluation in the context of mobilisation.","['Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Krawczynska, Anna', 'Czemerska, Magdalena', 'Pluta, Agnieszka', 'Cebula-Obrzut, Barbara', 'Szmigielska, Katarzyna', 'Stepka, Konrad', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka']","['Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Krawczynska A', 'Czemerska M', 'Pluta A', 'Cebula-Obrzut B', 'Szmigielska K', 'Stepka K', 'Smolewski P', 'Robak T', 'Wierzbowska A']","['Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Sports Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140912,Italy,Blood Transfus,Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,101237479,"['0 (ANGPT1 protein, human)', '0 (ANGPT2 protein, human)', '0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiopoietin-1/*blood', 'Angiopoietin-2/*blood', 'Autografts', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteopontin/*blood']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2014.0002-14 [pii]', '10.2450/2014.0002-14 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Transfus. 2015 Jan;13(1):102-8. doi: 10.2450/2014.0002-14.

In spite of this variability, MDS is associated with typical recurrent non-random cytogenetic defects. Chromosomal abnormalities are detected in the malignant bone-marrow cells of approximately 40-80 % of patients with primary or secondary MDS. The most frequent chromosomal rearrangements involve chromosomes 5, 7 and 8. MDS often shows presence of unbalanced chromosomal changes, especially large deletions [del(5), del(7q), del(12p), del(18q), del(20q)] or losses of whole chromosomes (7 and Y). The most typical cytogenetic abnormality is a partial or complete deletion of 5q- that occurs in roughly 30 % of all MDS cases either as the sole abnormality or in combination with other aberrations as a part of frequently complex karyotypes. The mechanisms responsible for the formation of MDS-associated recurrent translocations and complex karyotypes are unknown. Since some of the mentioned aberrations are characteristic for several haematological malignancies, more general cellular conditions could be expected to play a role. In this article, we introduce the most common rearrangements linked to MDS and discuss the potential role of the non-random higher-order chromatin structure in their formation. A contribution of the chromothripsis - a catastrophic event discovered only recently - is considered to explain how complex karyotypes may occur (during a single event).","['Pagacova, E', 'Falk, M', 'Falkova, I', 'Lukasova, E', 'Michalova, K', 'Oltova, A', 'Raska, I', 'Kozubek, S']","['Pagacova E', 'Falk M', 'Falkova I', 'Lukasova E', 'Michalova K', 'Oltova A', 'Raska I', 'Kozubek S']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v. v. i., Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v. v. i., Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v. v. i., Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v. v. i., Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Centre of Oncocytogenetics, General University Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic, and The Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion (IHBT), Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Cellular Biology and Pathology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v. v. i., Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,['0 (Chromatin)'],IM,"['Chromatin/*metabolism', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['FB2014A0025 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2014;60 Suppl 1:1-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to examine the relationship between disease-specific funding levels of National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the main governmental resource for health research in China, and burden of disease. METHODS: Funding magnitudes for 53 diseases or conditions were obtained from the website of NSFC. Measures of disease burden, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. The relationship between NSFC funding and disease burden was analyzed with univariate linear regression. For each measure associated with funding, regression-derived estimates were used to calculate the expected funds for each disease. The actual and expected funds were then compared. We also evaluated the impacts of changes of disease burden metrics since 1990, and differences from the world averages on NSFC funding. RESULTS: NSFC health research funding was associated with disease burden measured in mortality (R = 0.33, P = 0.02), YLLs (R = 0.39, P = 0.004), and DALYs (R = 0.40, P = 0.003). But none of the changes of mortality (R = 0.22, P = 0.12), YLLs (R = -0.04, P = 0.79) and DALYs (R = -0.003, P = 0.98) since 1990 was associated with the funding magnitudes. None of the differences of mortality (R = -0.11, P = 0.45), YLLs (R = -0.11, P = 0.43) and DALYs (R = -0.12, P = 0.38) from that of the concurrent world averages were associated with the funding magnitudes. Measured by DALY, stroke and COPD received the least funding compared to expected; while leukemia and diabetes received the most funding compared to expected. CONCLUSION: Although NSFC funding were roughly associated with disease burden as measured in mortality, YLLs and DALYs. Some major diseases such as stroke were underfunded; while others such as leukaemia were overfunded. Change of disease burden during the last 20 years and country-specialized disease burden were not reflected in current allocation of NSFC funds.","['Xu, Gelin', 'Zhang, Zhizhong', 'Lv, Qiushi', 'Li, Yun', 'Ye, Ruidong', 'Xiong, Yunyun', 'Jiang, Yongjun', 'Liu, Xinfeng']","['Xu G', 'Zhang Z', 'Lv Q', 'Li Y', 'Ye R', 'Xiong Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu X']","['Department of Neurology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141104,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Biomedical Research/*economics', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cost of Illness', 'Diabetes Mellitus/economics/epidemiology', 'Disabled Persons', 'Financial Support', 'Humans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Models', 'Neoplasms/economics/epidemiology', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Stroke/economics/epidemiology']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/06/26 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111458 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-35715 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 4;9(11):e111458. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111458. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4219749,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much less is known about HRQOL in the context of less common cancer sites. METHODS: HRQOL was examined with the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 1, and the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey in patients with selected cancers (kidney cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma, chronic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma) and in individuals without cancer on the basis of data linked from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry system and the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey. Scale scores, Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, and a utility metric (Short Form 6D/Veterans RAND 6D), adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and other chronic conditions, were calculated. A 3-point difference in the scale scores and a 2-point difference in the PCS and MCS scores were considered to be minimally important differences. RESULTS: Data from 16,095 cancer survivors and 1,224,549 individuals without a history of cancer were included. The results indicated noteworthy deficits in physical health status. Mental health was comparable, although scores for the Role-Emotional and Social Functioning scales were worse for patients with most types of cancer versus those without cancer. Survivors of multiple myeloma and pancreatic malignancies reported the lowest scores, with their PCS/MCS scores less than those of individuals without cancer by 3 or more points. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL surveillance efforts revealed poor health outcomes among many older adults and specifically among survivors of multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer.","['Kent, Erin E', 'Ambs, Anita', 'Mitchell, Sandra A', 'Clauser, Steven B', 'Smith, Ashley Wilder', 'Hays, Ron D']","['Kent EE', 'Ambs A', 'Mitchell SA', 'Clauser SB', 'Smith AW', 'Hays RD']","['Applied Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141104,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', '*Health Status', '*Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Quality of Life', 'SEER Program', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States/epidemiology']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29119 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Mar 1;121(5):758-65. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29119.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the formation of a PML-RARalpha fusion protein, leads to the accumulation of abnormal promyelocytes. In order to understand the precise mechanisms involved in human APL leukemogenesis, we established a humanized in vivo APL model involving retroviral transduction of PML-RARA into CD34(+) hematopoietic cells from human cord blood and transplantation of these cells into immunodeficient mice. The leukemia well recapitulated human APL, consisting of leukemic cells with abundant azurophilic abnormal granules in the cytoplasm, which expressed CD13, CD33 and CD117, but not HLA-DR and CD34, were clustered in the same category as human APL samples in the gene expression analysis, and demonstrated sensitivity to ATRA. As seen in human APL, the induced APL cells showed a low transplantation efficiency in the secondary recipients, which was also exhibited in the transplantations that were carried out using the sorted CD34- fraction. In order to analyze the mechanisms underlying APL initiation and development, fractionated human cord blood was transduced with PML-RARA. Common myeloid progenitors (CMP) from CD34(+)/CD38(+) cells developed APL. These findings demonstrate that CMP are a target fraction for PML-RARA in APL, whereas the resultant CD34(-) APL cells may share the ability to maintain the tumor.","['Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Yahata, Takashi', 'Sheng, Yin', 'Nakamura, Yoshihiko', 'Muguruma, Yukari', 'Matsuzawa, Hideyuki', 'Tanaka, Masayuki', 'Hayashi, Hideki', 'Sato, Tadayuki', 'Damdinsuren, Anar', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Ito, Mamoru', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Ando, Kiyoshi']","['Matsushita H', 'Yahata T', 'Sheng Y', 'Nakamura Y', 'Muguruma Y', 'Matsuzawa H', 'Tanaka M', 'Hayashi H', 'Sato T', 'Damdinsuren A', 'Onizuka M', 'Ito M', 'Miyachi H', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Ando K']","['Research Center for Cancer Stem Cell, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan; Medical Research Institute, Tokai University, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research Center for Cancer Stem Cell, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan; Medical Research Institute, Tokai University, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan; Department of Cell Transplantation, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research Center for Cancer Stem Cell, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research Center for Cancer Stem Cell, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research Center for Cancer Stem Cell, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research Center for Cancer Stem Cell, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan; Support Center for Medical Research and Education, Tokai University, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Support Center for Medical Research and Education, Tokai University, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Support Center for Medical Research and Education, Tokai University, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Support Center for Medical Research and Education, Tokai University, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Research Center for Cancer Stem Cell, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan; Medical Research Institute, Tokai University, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141104,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/07/02 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111082 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-08526 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 4;9(11):e111082. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111082. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4219701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified miR-509 via a human genome-wide gain-of-function screen for miRs that inhibit growth of the NALM6 human B-ALL cell line. MiR-509-mediated inhibition of NALM6 growth was confirmed by 3 independent assays. Enforced miR-509 expression inhibited 2 of 2 additional B-ALL cell lines tested, but not 3 non-B-ALL leukemia cell lines. MiR-509-transduced NALM6 cells had reduced numbers of actively proliferating cells and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. Using miR target prediction algorithms and a filtering strategy, RAB5C was predicted as a potentially relevant target of miR-509. Enforced miR-509 expression in NALM6 cells reduced RAB5C mRNA and protein levels, and RAB5C was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-509. Knockdown of RAB5C in NALM6 cells recapitulated the growth inhibitory effects of miR-509. Co-expression of the RAB5C open reading frame without its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) blocked the growth-inhibitory effect mediated by miR-509. These findings establish RAB5C as a target of miR-509 and an important regulator of B-ALL cell growth with potential as a therapeutic target.","['Tan, Yee Sun', 'Kim, MinJung', 'Kingsbury, Tami J', 'Civin, Curt I', 'Cheng, Wen-Chih']","['Tan YS', 'Kim M', 'Kingsbury TJ', 'Civin CI', 'Cheng WC']","['Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Department of Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Department of Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Department of Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141104,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MIRN509 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RAB5C protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab5 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'rab5 GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111777 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-25760 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 4;9(11):e111777. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111777. eCollection 2014.,,,"['P01 CA070970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4219775,,,,,['GEO/GSE51908'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently we developed and characterized a first-in-class peptide-based adiponectin receptor agonist by using in vitro and in vivo models of glioblastoma and breast cancer (BC). In the current study, we further explored the effects of peptide ADP355 in additional cellular models and found that ADP355 inhibited chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell proliferation and renal myofibroblast differentiation with mid-nanomolar IC50 values. According to molecular modeling calculations, ADP355 was remarkably flexible in the global minimum with a turn present in the middle of the peptide. Considering these structural features of ADP355 and the fact that adiponectin normally circulates as multimeric complexes, we developed and tested the activity of a linear branched dimer (ADP399). The dimer exhibited approximately 20-fold improved cellular activity inhibiting K562 CML and MCF-7 cell growth with high pM-low nM relative IC50 values. Biodistribution studies suggested superior tissue dissemination of both peptides after subcutaneous administration relative to intraperitoneal inoculation. After screening of a 397-member adiponectin active site library, a novel octapeptide (ADP400) was designed that counteracted 10-1000 nM ADP355- and ADP399-mediated effects on CML and BC cell growth at nanomolar concentrations. ADP400 induced mitogenic effects in MCF-7 BC cells perhaps due to antagonizing endogenous adiponectin actions or acting as an inverse agonist. While the linear dimer agonist ADP399 meets pharmacological criteria of a contemporary peptide drug lead, the peptide showing antagonist activity (ADP400) at similar concentrations will be an important target validation tool to study adiponectin functions.","['Otvos, Laszlo Jr', 'Knappe, Daniel', 'Hoffmann, Ralf', 'Kovalszky, Ilona', 'Olah, Julia', 'Hewitson, Tim D', 'Stawikowska, Roma', 'Stawikowski, Maciej', 'Cudic, Predrag', 'Lin, Feng', 'Wade, John D', 'Surmacz, Eva', 'Lovas, Sandor']","['Otvos L Jr', 'Knappe D', 'Hoffmann R', 'Kovalszky I', 'Olah J', 'Hewitson TD', 'Stawikowska R', 'Stawikowski M', 'Cudic P', 'Lin F', 'Wade JD', 'Surmacz E', 'Lovas S']","['Department of Biology, Temple University Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Universitat Leipzig Leipzig, Germany.', 'Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Universitat Leipzig Leipzig, Germany.', '1st Institute of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University Budapest, Hungary.', '1st Institute of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Melbourne Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies Port St. Lucie, Florida, FL, USA.', 'Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies Port St. Lucie, Florida, FL, USA.', 'Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies Port St. Lucie, Florida, FL, USA.', 'Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health and School of Chemistry, The University of Melbourne Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health and School of Chemistry, The University of Melbourne Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Temple University Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Creighton University NE, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141017,Switzerland,Front Chem,Frontiers in chemistry,101627988,,,,2014/11/05 06:00,2014/11/05 06:01,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fchem.2014.00093 [doi]'],epublish,Front Chem. 2014 Oct 17;2:93. doi: 10.3389/fchem.2014.00093. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['antiproliferation', 'biodistribution', 'dimeric peptide', 'molecular dynamics simulations', 'nanomolar activity']","['P20 GM103427/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016469/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AR064925/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4201147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The description of the Philadelphia chromosome ushered in a new era in the field of cancer cytogenetics. Accumulating genetic data have been shown to be intimately associated with the diagnosis and prognosis of neoplasms; thus, karyotyping is now considered a mandatory investigation for all newly diagnosed leukemias. The development of FISH in the 1980s overcame many of the drawbacks of assessing the genetic alterations in cancer cells by karyotyping. Karyotyping of cancer cells remains the gold standard since it provides a global analysis of the abnormalities in the entire genome of a single cell. However, subsequent methodological advances in molecular cytogenetics based on the principle of FISH that were initiated in the early 1990s have greatly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of karyotype analysis by marrying conventional cytogenetics with molecular technologies. In this review, the development, current utilization, and technical pitfalls of both the conventional and molecular cytogenetics approaches used for cancer diagnosis over the past five decades will be discussed.","['Wan, Thomas S K']",['Wan TS'],"['Haematology Division, Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141028,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2014.34.6.413 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2014 Nov;34(6):413-25. doi: 10.3343/alm.2014.34.6.413.

Pro-survival MCL-1 is essential for survival of T-cell progenitors, BCL-XL for immature thymocytes, and BCL-2 for mature T cells. Conversely, little is known about the regulators that are required for the survival of T-cell lymphomas. We used constitutive and conditionally gene-targeted mice to investigate which pro-survival BCL-2 family member is required for the sustained survival of thymic lymphomas initiated by loss of p53. Constitutive loss of a single Mcl-1 allele delayed tumor onset. In contrast, lymphomas emerging in p53(-/-) mice in which Mcl-1 could be conditionally deleted had been selected for retention of MCL-1 expression. In contrast, complete loss of BCL-XL had no impact on lymphoma development in p53(-/-) mice. These results demonstrate that thymic lymphomas elicited by loss of p53 must arise from cancer-initiating cells that require MCL-1 for their survival. Acute deletion of both Mcl-1 alleles abrogated the expansion of p53(-/-) lymphomas in mice, whereas inducible loss of BCL-XL had little impact. This reveals that MCL-1 is essential for the sustained survival of these malignant cells and suggests that targeting MCL-1 may be an attractive strategy for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma.","['Grabow, Stephanie', 'Delbridge, Alex R D', 'Valente, Liz J', 'Strasser, Andreas']","['Grabow S', 'Delbridge AR', 'Valente LJ', 'Strasser A']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia; and The Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia; and The Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia; and The Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia; and The Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141103,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, p53', 'Genotype', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*physiology']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39560-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-601567 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 18;124(26):3939-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-601567.

In the extracellular compartment, it exhibits cytokine-/adipokinelike properties, suggesting that it stands at the crossroad between metabolism and inflammation. Here we show that both intracellular and extracellular NAMPT levels are increased in cells and plasma of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The extracellular form (eNAMPT) is produced by CLL lymphocytes upon B-cell receptor, Toll-like receptor, and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway activation. eNAMPT is important for differentiation of resting monocytes, polarizing them toward tumor-supporting M2 macrophages. These cells express high levels of CD163, CD206, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and secrete immunosuppressive (interleukin [IL] 10, CC chemokine ligand 18) and tumor-promoting (IL-6, IL-8) cytokines. NAMPT-primed M2 macrophages activate extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and NF-kappaB signaling; promote leukemic cell survival; and reduce T-cell responses. These effects are independent of the enzymatic activity of NAMPT, as inferred from the use of an enzymatically inactive mutant. Overall, these results reveal that eNAMPT is a critical element in the induction of an immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting microenvironment of CLL.","['Audrito, Valentina', 'Serra, Sara', 'Brusa, Davide', 'Mazzola, Francesca', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Maffei, Rossana', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Wang, Tao', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Rizzi, Menico', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Garcia, Joe G N', 'Wolberger, Cynthia', 'Raffaelli, Nadia', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Audrito V', 'Serra S', 'Brusa D', 'Mazzola F', 'Arruga F', 'Vaisitti T', 'Coscia M', 'Maffei R', 'Rossi D', 'Wang T', 'Inghirami G', 'Rizzi M', 'Gaidano G', 'Garcia JG', 'Wolberger C', 'Raffaelli N', 'Deaglio S']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy; Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation, Torino, Italy;', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy; Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation, Torino, Italy;', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy; Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation, Torino, Italy;', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy;', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy; Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation, Torino, Italy;', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy; Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation, Torino, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy;', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, ""A.

We, thus, recommend administering drugs with a shorter half-life, such as filgrastim or lenograstim, to reduce infection incidence in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.","['Duval, Celine', 'Boucher, Stephanie', 'Moulin, Jean-Charles', 'Gourieux, Benedicte', 'Mauvieux, Laurent', 'Leveque, Dominique', 'Herbrecht, Raoul']","['Duval C', 'Boucher S', 'Moulin JC', 'Gourieux B', 'Mauvieux L', 'Leveque D', 'Herbrecht R']","['Pharmacy, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France celine.duval@chru-strasbourg.fr.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Pharmacy, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Pharmacy, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3A58010674 (pegfilgrastim)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*chemically induced', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['34/11/6747 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Nov;34(11):6747-8.,['NOTNLM'],"['Pegfilgrastim', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'fatal effect']",,,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the tumor cell growth-inhibition mechanism of amidoximes, especially benzamidoxime derivatives. Herein we determined the effects of N-(2-amino-5-chlorobenzoyl)benzamidoxime analogs on mammalian cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We synthesized four chloride-substituted benzamidoxime analogs from the original benzamidoxime to investigate their anticancer cell activity using the Jurkat T-cell lymphoma cell line and the human leukemia cell line HL-60RG. RESULTS: All amidoxime derivatives inhibited Jurkat and HL-60RG cell viability dose-dependently. Benzamidoximes tended to damage HL-60RG cells to a greater extent compared to Jurkat cells. Benzamidoximes with chloride substitutes caused a strong decrease in cell growth, and this cell growth attenuation was transient at 5 muM (below the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50) but long-lasting at 10 muM (greater than the IC50). CONCLUSION: Benzamidoxime derivatives caused a transient cell-cycle delay at a low dose and cell death at a high dose.","['Nagahara, Yukitoshi', 'Nagahara, Katsuhiko']","['Nagahara Y', 'Nagahara K']","['Division of Life Science and Engineering, College of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Denki University, Hatoyama, Hiki-gun, Saitama, Japan yuki@mail.dendai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Life Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kitasato University, 5-9-1 Shirokane, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Benzamidines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '613-92-3 (benzamidoxime)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamidines/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['34/11/6521 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Nov;34(11):6521-6.,['NOTNLM'],"['Benzamidoxime', 'HL-60RG', 'Jurkat', 'apoptosis', 'cancer']",,,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell-cycle distribution and apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) for As2O3 against proliferation of HL-60 and HL-60-R2 cells were 12.2 and 7.2 muM, while those for arsenate were >200 and 62.1 muM, respectively. In contrast, organic methylarsinic acid, dimethylarsonic acid, trimethylarsine oxide, and tetramethylarsonium did not exert any inhibitory effects even at 200 muM. As2O3 and arsenate increased the proportion of apoptotic cells dose-dependently at a concentration range of 5-200 muM. As2O3 did not activate caspase 3/7 in HL-60 and HL-60-R2 cells. CONCLUSION: As2O3 and arsenate inhibit cell proliferation, affect cell-cycle distribution, and induce apoptosis of ATRA-resistant HL-60-R2 cells.

However, whether NOTCH is oncogenic or tumor-suppressive in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is still controversial. Herein, the roles of NOTCH in AML are reviewed. AML cells express NOTCH and NOTCH ligands; however, cell-autonomous activation is not observed. Activating NOTCH1 mutations are rare in AML, unlike in T-ALL. NOTCH ligand stimulation generally suppresses the in vitro growth of AML cells but promotes transient growth of some samples. Conversely, knockdown of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 does not affect the growth of AML cells, whereas it suppresses the growth of T-ALL cells. These findings suggest that NOTCH is dispensable or suppressive for AML cell growth. However, the effects of NOTCH differ depending on cell conditions, and various stemness-related signals modify these effects; hence, forced NOTCH activation in vitro may not exhibit effects in bone marrow. Thus, further understanding is required for the development of AML therapies targeting NOTCH signalling.","['Tohda, Shuji']",['Tohda S'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan tohda.mlab@tmd.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['34/11/6259 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Nov;34(11):6259-64.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'HEDGEHOG', 'JAGGED', 'NOTCH', 'WNT', 'review']",,,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent proteomic analysis has predicted that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (c-Abl) is a putative key regulator of adipogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remained obscure. We found that c-Abl was activated during the early phase of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Moreover, c-Abl activity was essential and its inhibition blocked differentiation to mature adipocytes. c-Abl directly controlled the expression and activity of the master adipogenic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma 2 (PPARgamma2). PPARgamma2 physically associated with c-Abl and underwent phosphorylation on two tyrosine residues within its regulatory activation function 1 (AF1) domain. We demonstrated that this process positively regulates PPARgamma2 stability and adipogenesis. Remarkably, c-Abl binding to PPARgamma2 required the Pro12 residue that has a phenotypically well-studied common human genetic proline 12 alanine substitution (Pro12Ala) polymorphism. Our findings establish a critical role for c-Abl in adipocyte differentiation and explain the behavior of the known Pro12Ala polymorphism.","['Keshet, Rom', 'Bryansker Kraitshtein, Zina', 'Shanzer, Matan', 'Adler, Julia', 'Reuven, Nina', 'Shaul, Yosef']","['Keshet R', 'Bryansker Kraitshtein Z', 'Shanzer M', 'Adler J', 'Reuven N', 'Shaul Y']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel yosef.shaul@weizmann.ac.il.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141103,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adipocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Adipogenesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mutation, Missense', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'PPAR gamma/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/chemistry', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proline/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1411086111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1411086111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Nov 18;111(46):16365-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1411086111.

In this study, we have documented that incubation of both HL-60 and K562 leukaemia cells with nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib is associated with the death of HL-60 cells observed within 24 hours of incubation with bortezomib and the death of K562 cells that were observed after 72 hours of incubation with bortezomib. The relative resistance of K562 cells to bortezomib correlated well with significantly higher expression of HSP27, HSP70, HSP90alpha, HSP90beta and GRP75 in these cells. Incubation of both HL-60 and K562 cells with bortezomib induced a cleavage of HSP90beta as well as expression of HSP70 and HSP90beta but bortezomib did not affect levels of HSP27, HSP90alpha, GRP75 and GRP78.

In addition, we describe the spectrum of other skin lesions, including, secondary skin malignancies and nonspecific benign skin lesions in haematological malignancy patients. METHODS: We defined 58 skin lesions that developed in 54 inpatients hospitalised in the Department of Haematology, Trakya University Medical Faculty, Turkey. All skin lesions that developed in inpatients between 2006 and 2012 had been evaluated by a dermatologist. The patients' clinical features, skin biopsy results and therapies were obtained from hospital files. The diagnosis of LC was based on clinical features and histopathological examinations of the skin biopsy. RESULTS: There were 11 patients with LC. Six (54.5%) had acute myeloblastic leukaemia. In nine patients (82%), LC was present at the initial presentation. Secondary skin malignancy was detected in 11 patients (five basal cell carcinoma, four Kaposi's sarcoma, one squamous cell carcinoma, one malignant melanoma); and malignancy was present in two patients (18%) at the initial presentation. Nonspecific benign skin lesions, the most frequent of which were drug eruptions, were determined in 32 of our patients. LC had a significantly higher likelihood of being present at initial presentation than other skin lesions (P < 0.01). The median survival in LC patients was quite short (4.5 months). CONCLUSIONS: LC was usually diagnosed at the initial presentation of the patient or during the early course of the disease. Having LC was a poor prognostic factor.","['Pamuk, Gulsum Emel', 'Ak, Recep', 'Tasci, Murat', 'Harmandar, Ferda', 'Demir, Muzaffer', 'Arican, Ozer']","['Pamuk GE', 'Ak R', 'Tasci M', 'Harmandar F', 'Demir M', 'Arican O']","['Division of Haematology, Trakya University Medical Faculty, Edirne, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141104,Australia,Australas J Dermatol,The Australasian journal of dermatology,0135232,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', '*Drug Eruptions/etiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced/*pathology']",2014/11/05 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2013/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ajd.12193 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas J Dermatol. 2015 May;56(2):116-9. doi: 10.1111/ajd.12193.

There are anecdotal reports of cases without thymoma, with various suspected aetiologies. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To identify common features, underlying causes, response to therapy and outcome of nonthymoma-associated exfoliative dermatitis in cats. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was carried out of cases presented to dermatology referral centres or cases submitted for histopathological examination. Detailed historical and clinical data were obtained and evaluated statistically. Histopathology was reviewed in a blinded fashion by three dermatopathologists, and PCR for herpesvirus was performed. RESULTS: Eighteen cats fulfilled all inclusion criteria. There was no sex, age or breed predisposition. All cats presented with severe generalized (77%) or multifocal exfoliation (23%); 12 cats were severely depressed. In all cats, thymoma was excluded radiographically and feline leukaemia virus tests were negative. Additional imaging procedures in 14 cats and postmortem examination in two cats did not detect neoplasia. Histopathology revealed interface dermatitis, mural interface folliculitis and sebaceous adenitis indistinguishable from findings in thymoma-associated cases. PCR for herpes DNA was negative. No aetiology was identified. Treatment in 12 cases consisted of immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids and/or ciclosporin; one responded to antibiotics, one to shampoo, two went into spontaneous remission, and two did not receive any therapy and were euthanized. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Nonthymoma-associated exfoliative dermatitis in cats is clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from thymoma-associated cases. Most cases benefit from immunosuppressive therapy; therefore, an immunopathological response to an undefined trigger is suspected.","['Linek, Monika', 'Rufenacht, Silvia', 'Brachelente, Chiara', 'von Tscharner, Claudia', 'Favrot, Claude', 'Wilhelm, Sylvia', 'Nett, Claudia', 'Mueller, Ralf S', 'Mayer, Ursula', 'Welle, Monika']","['Linek M', 'Rufenacht S', 'Brachelente C', 'von Tscharner C', 'Favrot C', 'Wilhelm S', 'Nett C', 'Mueller RS', 'Mayer U', 'Welle M']","['Tieraerztliche Spezialisten, Rodigallee 85, D-22043, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20141103,England,Vet Dermatol,Veterinary dermatology,9426187,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Female', 'History, Ancient', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/pathology', 'Thymoma/complications/veterinary', 'Thymus Neoplasms/complications/veterinary']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/09/25 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vde.12169 [doi]'],ppublish,"Vet Dermatol. 2015 Feb;26(1):40-5, e12-3. doi: 10.1111/vde.12169.

This success was achieved, in part, through the implementation of risk-stratified therapy. Nevertheless, for a subgroup of patients (15-20%) with newly diagnosed ALL who will ultimately relapse, traditional risk assessment remains inadequate. The risk of relapse may be estimated on the basis of diagnostic features or early treatment response findings. Further progress in this field may thus come from refinement of predictive factors for relapse and treatment adaptation and from the identification of biological subsets of ALL patients who could benefit from specific target therapies.

METHODS: For NGS data evaluation including extraction of biologically relevant low-level variants from background error noise, we established and applied a robust and versatile bioinformatics approach. RESULTS: Results from a retrospective longitudinal analysis of 135 samples of 15 CML patients showed that NGS could have revealed emerging resistant mutants 2-11 months earlier than conventional sequencing. Interestingly, in cases who later failed first-line imatinib treatment, NGS revealed that TKI-resistant mutations were already detectable at the time of major or deeper molecular response. Identification of emerging mutations by NGS was mirrored by BCR-ABL1 transcript level expressed either fluctuations around 0.1 %(IS) or by slight transcript level increase. NGS also allowed tracing mutations that emerged during second-line TKI therapy back to the time of switchover. Compound mutants could be detected in three cases, but were not found to outcompete single mutants. CONCLUSIONS: This work points out, that next-generation deep sequencing, coupled with a robust bioinformatics approach for mutation calling, may be just in place to ensure reliable detection of emerging BCR-ABL1 mutations, allowing early therapy switch and selection of the most appropriate therapy. Further, prospective assessment of how to best integrate NGS in the molecular monitoring and clinical decision algorithms is warranted.","['Machova Polakova, Katerina', 'Kulvait, Vojtech', 'Benesova, Adela', 'Linhartova, Jana', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Jaruskova, Monika', 'de Benedittis, Caterina', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Stopka, Tomas', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Soverini, Simona']","['Machova Polakova K', 'Kulvait V', 'Benesova A', 'Linhartova J', 'Klamova H', 'Jaruskova M', 'de Benedittis C', 'Haferlach T', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G', 'Stopka T', 'Ernst T', 'Hochhaus A', 'Kohlmann A', 'Soverini S']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic, katerina.machova@uhkt.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141104,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Computational Biology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1845-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 May;141(5):887-99. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1845-6.

Pharmacological tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including imatinib mesylate, have overcome limitations in conventional treatment for the improved clinical management of CML. RECENT ADVANCES: Accumulated evidence has led to the identification of a subpopulation of quiescent leukemia progenitor cells with stem-like self renewal properties that may initiate leukemogenesis, which are also shown to be present in residual disease due to their insensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibition. CRITICAL ISSUES: The characterization of quiescent leukemia progenitor cells as a unique cell population in CML pathogenesis has become critical with the complete elucidation of mechanisms involved in their survival independent of BCR-ABL that is important in the development of novel anticancer strategies. Understanding of these functional pathways in CML progenitor cells will allow for their selective therapeutic targeting. In addition, disease pathogenesis and drug responsiveness is also thought to be modulated by epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and microRNA expression, with a capacity to control CML-associated gene transcription. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: A number of compounds in combination with TKIs are under preclinical and clinical investigation to assess their synergistic potential in targeting leukemic progenitor cells and/or the epigenome in CML. Despite the collective promise, further research is required in order to refine understanding, and, ultimately, advance antileukemic therapeutic strategies.","['Tortorella, Stephanie M', 'Hung, Andrew', 'Karagiannis, Tom C']","['Tortorella SM', 'Hung A', 'Karagiannis TC']","['1 Epigenomic Medicine, Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, The Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct , Melbourne, Australia .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150119,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/10/31 06:00,['2014/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/ars.2014.6096 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2015 Jun 1;22(16):1425-62. doi: 10.1089/ars.2014.6096.

Splenomegaly, frequently observed in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), is associated with poor prognosis. However, how the spleen microenvironment distinctly affects T-ALL cells as opposed to bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has not been addressed. METHODS: A Notch1-induced mouse T-ALL model was applied in this study. Flow cytometry and two-photon fluorescence microscopy were used to analyze early distribution of T-ALL cells. MILLIPLEX(R) MAP Multiplex Immunoassay was performed to measure cytokine/chemokine levels in different microenvironments. Transwell and co-culture experiments were used to test the effects of splenic microenvironment in vitro. Splenectomy was performed to assess the organ specific impact on the survival of T-ALL-bearing mice. RESULTS: More leukemia cells were detected in the spleen than in the BM after injection of T-ALL cells by flow cytometry and two-photon fluorescence microscopy analysis. By screening a panel of cytokines/chemokines, a higher level of MIP-3beta was found in the splenic microenvironment than BM microenvironment. In vitro transwell experiment further confirmed that MIP-3beta recruits T-ALL cells which express a high level of MIP-3beta receptor, CCR7. Furthermore, the splenic microenvironment stimulates T-ALL cells to express a higher level of MIP-3beta, which further recruits T-ALL cells to the spleen. Co-culture experiment found that the splenic microenvironment more potently stimulated the proliferation and migration of T-ALL cells than BM. Moreover, the mice transplanted with T-ALL cells from the spleen had a shorter life span than those transplanted from BM, suggesting increased potency of the T-ALL cells induced by the splenic microenvironment. In addition, splenectomy prolonged the survival of leukemic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates an organ specific effect on leukemia development. Specifically, T-ALL cells can be potentiated by splenic microenvironment and thus spleen may serve as a target organ for the treatment of some types of leukemia.","['Ma, Shihui', 'Shi, Yingxu', 'Pang, Yakun', 'Dong, Fang', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Hao, Sha', 'Xu, Jing', 'Zhu, Xiaofan', 'Yuan, Weiping', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Zheng, Guoguang']","['Ma S', 'Shi Y', 'Pang Y', 'Dong F', 'Cheng H', 'Hao S', 'Xu J', 'Zhu X', 'Yuan W', 'Cheng T', 'Zheng G']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. msh257257@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. shi.yingxu.wolf@gmail.com.', 'Current address of Yingxu Shi: Affiliated Hospital Clinical Laboratory, Inner Mongolian Medical University, Hohhot, China. shi.yingxu.wolf@gmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. pangyakun6@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. dfh831229@sina.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. chenghui.pumc@gmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. sha.hao@hotmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.

MELK is expressed in AML cell lines and AML blasts with higher levels in less differentiated cells. MELK is frequently upregulated in AML with complex karyotypes and is associated with worse clinical outcome. MELK knockdown resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis of leukemic cells. Hence, we investigated the potent anti-leukemia activity of OTS167, a small molecule MELK kinase inhibitor, in AML, and found that the compound induced cell differentiation and apoptosis as well as decreased migration of AML cells. MELK expression was positively correlated with the expression of FOXM1 as well as its downstream target genes. Furthermore, MELK inhibition resulted in downregulation of FOXM1 activity and the expression of its downstream targets.

In this study, the bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type II (BMPR2), E1A binding protein p300 (EP300), transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2), and tumor necrosis factor, and alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) gene expression patterns in B-cell malignancies were studied. METHODS: The relative expression levels of BMPR2, EP300, TGFbeta2, and TNFAIP3 mRNA in B-lymphoma cell lines, myeloid cell lines, as well as in cells from healthy volunteers, were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with SYBR Green Dye. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as reference. RESULTS: The expression level of TGFbeta2 mRNA in B-lymphoma cell lines was significantly higher than those in the cells from the healthy control (P<0.05). However, the expression level of TNFAIP3 mRNA in B-malignant cells was significantly lower than that of the healthy control (P<0.05). The expression levels of BMPR2 and EP300 mRNA showed no significant difference between B-malignant cell lines and the healthy group (P>0.05). In B-lymphoma cell lines, correlation analyses revealed that the expression of BMPR2 and TNFAIP3 (r=0.882, P=0.04) had significant positive relation. The expression levels of BMPR2, EP300, and TNFAIP3 mRNA in cell lines from myeloid leukemia were significantly lower than those in the cells from the healthy control (P<0.05). The expression levels of TGFbeta2 mRNA showed no significant difference between myeloid leukemia cell lines and the healthy control or B-malignant cell lines (P>0.05). The expression levels of BMPR2, EP300, and TNFAIP3 mRNA in B-lymphoma cells were significantly higher than those of the myeloid leukemia cells (P<0.05).

Bardoxolone methyl, the C-28 methyl ester of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) known as CDDO-Me or RTA 402, is one of the derivatives of synthetic triterpenoids. CDDO-Me has been used for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, cancer (including leukemia and solid tumors), and other diseases. In this review, we will update our knowledge of the clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CDDO-Me, highlighting its clinical benefits and the underlying mechanisms involved. The role of the Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in the therapeutic activities of CDDO-Me will be discussed. CDDO-Me contains alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl groups on rings A and C that can generate reversible adducts with the thiol groups of Cys residues in target proteins such as Keap1 and IkappaB kinase. At low nanomolar concentrations, CDDO-Me protects the cells against oxidative stress via inhibition of reactive oxygen species generation, while CDDO-Me at low micromolar concentrations induces apoptosis by increasing reactive oxygen species and decreasinging intracellular glutathione levels. Through Keap1/Nrf2 and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways, this agent can modulate the activities of a number of important proteins that regulate inflammation, redox balance, cell proliferation and programmed cell death. In a Phase I trial in cancer patients, CDDO-Me was found to have a slow and saturable oral absorption, a relatively long terminal phase half-life (39 hours at 900 mg/day), nonlinearity (dose-dependent) at high doses (600-1,300 mg/day), and high interpatient variability. As a multifunctional agent, CDDO-Me has improved the renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes. CDDO-Me has shown a promising anticancer effect in a Phase I trial. This agent is generally well tolerated, but it may increase adverse cardiovascular events. Presently, it is being further tested for the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease, cancer, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.","['Wang, Yan-Yang', 'Yang, Yin-Xue', 'Zhe, Hong', 'He, Zhi-Xu', 'Zhou, Shu-Feng']","['Wang YY', 'Yang YX', 'Zhe H', 'He ZX', 'Zhou SF']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, Ningxia, People's Republic of China ; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA."", ""Department of Colon-rectal Surgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, Ningxia, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiation Oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, Ningxia, People's Republic of China."", ""Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center and Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA ; Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center and Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141023,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'CEG1Q6OGU1 (bardoxolone methyl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Inflammation/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/drug therapy/metabolism']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/08/14 06:00,['2014/11/04 06:00'],"['2014/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S68872 [doi]', 'dddt-8-2075 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2014 Oct 23;8:2075-88. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S68872. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['CDDO-Me', 'Keap1', 'NF-kappaB', 'Nrf2', 'cancer', 'chronic kidney disease', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension']",,PMC4211867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MRD was assessed by MFC in 1030 follow-up samples from 265 pediatric and adult patients with de novo ALL treated in the FRALLE, EORTC, or GRALL clinical trials. MRD assessment as applied by the eight participating MFC laboratories is described in detail regarding cell preparation, leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) markers and data analysis. Samples were obtained from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB). Immunostaining was performed after erythrocyte lysis or Ficoll enrichment. RESULTS: This study confirms the applicability of MFC-based MRD assessment in 97% of patients with ALL at the 10(-4) cut-off. MRD values after Ficoll enrichment and erythrocyte lysis were found comparable. Higher MRD values were obtained in BM than in PB, especially for B-lineage ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of MRD by MFC at the 10(-4) cut-off is applicable within a few hours for almost all patients and using a comparable analytical strategy allows for multicenter collaborative studies. The method can be introduced in a strategy aimed at defining the risk of failure of patients with childhood or adult ALL.","['Fossat, Chantal', 'Roussel, Mikael', 'Arnoux, Isabelle', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Brouzes, Chantal', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Jacob, Marie-Christine', 'Kuhlein, Emilienne', 'Macintyre-Davi, Elizabeth', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Robillard, Nelly', 'Tkaczuk, Jean', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Bene, Marie C', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Garand, Richard']","['Fossat C', 'Roussel M', 'Arnoux I', 'Asnafi V', 'Brouzes C', 'Garnache-Ottou F', 'Jacob MC', 'Kuhlein E', 'Macintyre-Davi E', 'Plesa A', 'Robillard N', 'Tkaczuk J', 'Ifrah N', 'Dombret H', 'Bene MC', 'Baruchel A', 'Garand R']","['Hematology Laboratory, Hopital de la Timone, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141101,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

However, robust comparisons between these regimens are still lacking. We conducted a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis regarding these three regimens. Mixed treatment comparison is a statistical method of data summarization that aggregates data from both direct and indirect effect estimates. Literature search strategy included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Scielo and LILACS, from inception until August 2013 and resulted in the inclusion of 17 trials enrolling 7258 adult patients. HDD [relative risk (RR) 1.13; 95% credible interval (CrI) 1.02-1.26] and IDA (RR 1.13; 95% CrI 1.05-1.23) showed higher CR rates than CDD. IDA also led to lower long-term overall mortality rates when compared with CDD (RR 0.93, 95% CrI 0.86-0.99), whereas HDD and CDD were no different (RR 0.94, 95% CrI 0.85-1.02). HDD and IDA comparison did not reach statistically significant differences in CR (RR 1.00; 95% CrI 0.89-1.11) and in long-term mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CrI 0.91-1.11). IDA and HDD are consistently superior to CDD in inducing CR, and IDA was associated with lower long-term mortality. On the basis of these findings, we recommend incorporation of IDA and HDD instead of the traditional CDD as standard treatments for acute myeloid leukaemia induction. The lack of HDD benefit on mortality, when compared with CDD in this study, should be cautiously addressed, because it may have been susceptible to underestimation because of statistical power limitations.","['Sekine, Leo', 'Morais, Vinicius Daudt', 'Lima, Karine Margarites', 'Onsten, Tor Gunnar Hugo', 'Ziegelmann, Patricia Klarmann', 'Ribeiro, Rodrigo Antonini']","['Sekine L', 'Morais VD', 'Lima KM', 'Onsten TG', 'Ziegelmann PK', 'Ribeiro RA']","['Post-Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Institute for Research and Education, Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Institute for Research and Education, Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Internal Medicine Department, School of Medicine, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Statistics Department, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'National Institute of Science and Technology for Health Technology Assessment, CNPq, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'National Institute of Science and Technology for Health Technology Assessment, CNPq, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Institute for Research and Education, Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Porto Alegre, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20141103,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",2014/11/05 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2014/11/04 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2173 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2015 Dec;33(4):212-9. doi: 10.1002/hon.2173.

METHODS: A total of 15 AML and 15 ALL patients were studied. Serum samples were taken prior to anticancer therapy and were analyzed by biochip based immunoassays on the Evidence Investigator analyzer. This approach allows simultaneous detection of multiple analytes from a single sample. T-tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Comparing cytokine and adhesion molecules levels in newly diagnosed AML and ALL patients, we found significant increase in AML in serum IL-4 (P < 0.0001), IL-2 (P < 0.01), IL-3 (P < 0.05), and significant decrease (P < 0.05) in serum VEGF and VCAM-1. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that serum profile of cytokines and adhesion molecules differs in newly diagnosed AML and ALL patients. Further studies are needed to establish if these alterations could be used as a clinically relevant biomarker for acute leukemias.","['Horacek, Jan M', 'Kupsa, Tomas', 'Vasatova, Martina', 'Jebavy, Ladislav', 'Zak, Pavel']","['Horacek JM', 'Kupsa T', 'Vasatova M', 'Jebavy L', 'Zak P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4thDepartment of Internal Medicine - Hematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague and University Hospital Hradec Kralove.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4thDepartment of Internal Medicine - Hematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague and University Hospital Hradec Kralove.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Diagnostics, University Hospital Hradec Kralove.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4thDepartment of Internal Medicine - Hematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague and University Hospital Hradec Kralove.', '4thDepartment of Internal Medicine - Hematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague and University Hospital Hradec Kralove.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141029,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Protein Array Analysis/methods', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/05 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/04 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2014.051 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2015 Jun;159(2):299-301. doi: 10.5507/bp.2014.051.

In this study, these HTLV-1 tests were assessed using another sensitive method, that is, a luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS), to identify a better confirmatory test for HTLV-1 infection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma samples from 54 qualified donors and 114 HTLV-1 screening-positive donors were tested by LIPS for antibodies against HTLV-1 Gag, Tax, Env, and HBZ recombinant proteins. The donors were categorized into six groups, namely, (Group I) qualified donors, screening positive; (Group II) IF positive; (Group III) IF negative; (Group IV) WB positive; (Group V) WB negative; and (Group VI) screening positive in the previous blood donation, but WB-indeterminate during this study period. RESULTS: In Groups II and IV, all plasma samples tested positive by LIPS for antibodies against Gag and Env proteins. In Group V, all samples tested negative by LIPS, whereas some Group III samples reacted with single or double antigens in LIPS. In Group VI, the LIPS test identified a donor with suspected HTLV-1 infection. The first case of a blood donor with plasma that reacted with HBZ was identified by LIPS. CONCLUSION: Reevaluation of the current HTLV-1 screening method using the LIPS test showed that both confirmatory tests had similar sensitivity and specificity only when WB indeterminate results were eliminated. LIPS is a promising method for detecting and characterizing HTLV-1 antibodies.","['Furuta, Rika A', 'Ma, Guangyong', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Otani, Satoshi', 'Matsukura, Harumichi', 'Hirayama, Fumiya']","['Furuta RA', 'Ma G', 'Matsuoka M', 'Otani S', 'Matsukura H', 'Hirayama F']","['Japanese Red Cross, Kinki Block Blood Center, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross, Kinki Block Blood Center, Osaka, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross, Kinki Block Blood Center, Osaka, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross, Kinki Block Blood Center, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141102,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.5 (Luciferases, Renilla)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/immunology', '*Blood Donors', 'Blood Safety/*methods', 'Blotting, Western', 'Donor Selection/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Luciferases, Renilla/analysis/genetics', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retroviridae Proteins/immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viremia/*diagnosis/virology']",2014/11/05 06:00,2016/06/23 06:00,['2014/11/04 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/trf.12911 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2015 Apr;55(4):880-9. doi: 10.1111/trf.12911.

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and caused by donor T cells and inflammatory cytokines. The role of IL-35 in aGVHD is still unknown. Here we demonstrate that IL-35 overexpression suppresses CD4(+) effector T-cell activation, leading to a reduction in alloreactive T-cell responses and aGVHD severity. It also leads to the expansion of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the aGVHD target organs. Furthermore, IL-35 overexpression results in a selective decrease in the frequency of Th1 cells and an increase of IL-10-producing CD4(+) T cells in aGVHD target tissues. Serum levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-22 and IL-23 decrease and IL-10 increases in response to IL-35. Most importantly, IL-35 preserves graft-versus-leukemia effect. Finally, aGVHD grade 2-4 patients have decreased serum IL-35 levels comparing with time-matched patients with aGVHD grade 0-1. Our findings indicate that IL-35 has an important role in reducing aGVHD through promoting the expansion of Tregs and repressing Th1 responses, and should be investigated as the therapeutic strategy for aGVHD.","['Liu, Y', 'Wu, Y', 'Wang, Y', 'Cai, Y', 'Hu, B', 'Bao, G', 'Fang, H', 'Zhao, L', 'Ma, S', 'Cheng, Q', 'Song, Y', 'Liu, Y', 'Zhu, Z', 'Chang, H', 'Yu, X', 'Sun, A', 'Zhang, Y', 'Vignali,

However, a mutant p185(Y177FR552L) (p185(YR)), in which tyrosine 177 and arginine 552 in the SH2 domain are mutated, is still capable of transforming hematopoietic cells in vitro. Transplant of these cells into syngeneic mice also leads to leukemogenesis, albeit with a phenotype distinct from that produced by wild-type p185Bcr-Abl (p185(wt))-transformed cells. Here we show that G-protein coupled receptor 34 (Gpr34) expression is markedly up-regulated in p185(YR)-transformed cells compared to those transformed by p185(wt). Knockdown of Gpr34 in p185(YR) cells is sufficient to suppress growth factor-independent proliferation and survival in vitro and attenuate leukemogenesis in vivo. The Erk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways are activated in p185(YR) cells and the activation is dependent on Gpr34 expression. These studies identify Gpr34 as an alternative pathway that may mediate p185Bcr-Abl-induced transformation and leukemogenesis.","['Zuo, Bo', 'Li, Mei', 'Liu, Yulan', 'Li, Kun', 'Ma, Shuyun', 'Cui, Meihua', 'Qin, Yazhen', 'Zhu, Honghu', 'Pan, Xiuying', 'Guo, Jingzhu', 'Dai, Zonghan', 'Yu, Weidong']","['Zuo B', 'Li M', 'Liu Y', 'Li K', 'Ma S', 'Cui M', 'Qin Y', 'Zhu H', 'Pan X', 'Guo J', 'Dai Z', 'Yu W']","[""Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, People's Hospital, Peking University , Beijing , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141204,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (G-protein-coupled receptor 34)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Lysophospholipid)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Lysophospholipid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/11/05 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2014/11/04 06:00'],"['2014/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.981177 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015 Jul;56(7):2170-81. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.981177.

Cold-triggered ischaemic skin manifestations were observed in 33 patients (51%). Neurological manifestations were observed in 15 patients and renal manifestations in 13. Most of the patients with necrotic purpura (14/16, P = 0.009) and renal manifestations (11/13, P = 0.057) had IgG CG. IgG CG was associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma in 18, 13, 5 and 2 patients, respectively. IgM CG was associated with MGUS and Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia in 8 and 18 cases, respectively. One third of patients did not receive any specific treatment. Various treatments, including rituximab, were administered to 25/31 patients with IgG CG and 6/25 patients with IgM CG due to CG-related symptoms.

METHODS: Out of 1, 050 patients who received allo-BMTs between 1998 and 2000 in 21 Korean hospitals, 752 with first allo-BMT and complete data were included in this study. Study subjects were divided into the following three groups according to cumulative hospital experience of all-BMTs during the study period: low (< 30 cases), medium (30-49) and high (> or =50 cases) volume. Patient outcome was defined as early survival at day 100 and one-year survival. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between hospital experience and survival at day 100 and one year. RESULTS: When the low volume group was defined as the reference group, the adjusted relative risks (RR) of survival at day 100 for the high volume group were 2.46 (95% CI, 1.13-5.36) for all patients, 2.61 (1.04-6.57) for those with leukemia, and 2.20 (0.47-10.32) for those with aplastic anemia. For one-year survival, adjusted RR for the high volume group were 2.52 (1.40-4.51) for all patients, 1.99 (1.01-3.93) for leukemia, and 6.50 (1.57-26.80) for aplastic anemia. None of the RR for the medium volume group was statistically significant. Patient factors showing significant relationship with survival were donor-recipient relation, human leukocyte antigen matching status, time from diagnosis to transplant, and disease stage. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that the cumulative experience of hospitals in providing allo-BMT is positively associated with patient survival.","['Park, Choon Seon', 'Moon, Hee Kyung', 'Kang, Hye Young', 'Min, Yoo Hong', 'Cho, Woo Hyun']","['Park CS', 'Moon HK', 'Kang HY', 'Min YH', 'Cho WH']","['Department of Public Health, Graduate School, Yonsei University, Korea.', 'Department of Public Health, Graduate School, Yonsei University, Korea.', 'Department of Public Health, Graduate School, Yonsei University, Korea.', 'Department of Public Health, Graduate School, Yonsei University, Korea.', 'Department of Public Health, Graduate School, Yonsei University, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),J Prev Med Public Health,Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,101242972,,,,2004/02/01 00:00,2004/02/01 00:01,['2014/11/04 06:00'],"['2014/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2004/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Prev Med Public Health. 2004 Feb;37(1):26-36.,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation', 'Hospital procedure volume', 'Post-transplant survival', 'Volume-outcome relationship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been hypothesized that thyroid may influence cancer risk. Individuals with DS are at greater risk of developing leukemia than the general population, while solid tumors especially breast cancer (BC) are rare. BC patients have higher levels of circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin (PRL), both regulated by the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a hypothalamic tripeptide. This study was aimed at investigating the status of TRH functional polymorphisms in subjects with DS and BC. Unrelated families with DS probands (n=180), individuals with BC (n=99) and ethnically matched controls (n=216) were recruited. Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood was subjected to PCR amplification followed by DNA sequence analysis. Data obtained were analyzed by population- and family-based statistical analysis. Among 30 studied sites, only 2 (rs7645772 and rs13097335) were polymorphic.

The reaction intermediate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) has been shown to be abundant in embryonic stem cells and tissues but strongly depleted in human cancers. Genetic mutations of TET2 gene were associated with leukaemia, whereas TET1 downregulation has been shown to promote malignancy in breast cancer. Here we report that TET1 is downregulated in colon tumours from the initial stage. TET1 silencing in primary epithelial colon cells increase their cellular proliferation while its re-expression in colon cancer cells inhibits their proliferation and the growth of tumour xenografts even at later stages. We found that TET1 binds to the promoter of the DKK gene inhibitors of the WNT signalling to maintain them hypomethylated. Downregulation of TET1 during colon cancer initiation leads to repression, by DNA methylation, the promoters of the inhibitors of the WNT pathway resulting in a constitutive activation of the WNT pathway. Thus the DNA hydroxymethylation mediated by TET1 controlling the WNT signalling is a key player of tumour growth. These results provide new insights for understanding how tumours escape cellular controls.","['Neri, F', 'Dettori, D', 'Incarnato, D', 'Krepelova, A', 'Rapelli, S', 'Maldotti, M', 'Parlato, C', 'Paliogiannis, P', 'Oliviero, S']","['Neri F', 'Dettori D', 'Incarnato D', 'Krepelova A', 'Rapelli S', 'Maldotti M', 'Parlato C', 'Paliogiannis P', 'Oliviero S']","['Epigenetics, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy.', 'Epigenetics, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy.', '1] Epigenetics, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy [2] Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Chimica e Farmacia, Universita di Siena, Siena, Italy.', '1] Epigenetics, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy [2] Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Chimica e Farmacia, Universita di Siena, Siena, Italy.', '1] Epigenetics, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy [2] Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Chimica e Farmacia, Universita di Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Epigenetics, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy.', 'Epigenetics, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Microchirurgiche e Mediche, Universita di Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', '1] Epigenetics, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy [2] Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita e Biologia dei Sistemi, Universita di Torino Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141103,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/04 06:00'],"['2014/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014356 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.356 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Aug 6;34(32):4168-76. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.356.

Therefore, the search for new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for antiestrogen resistance is crucial. In this study, we performed a kinase inhibitor screen on antiestrogen responsive MCF-7 cells and a panel of MCF-7-derived tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell lines. Our focus was to identify common and distinct molecular mechanisms involved in tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell growth. We identified 18 inhibitors, of which the majority was common for both tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell lines. Two compounds, WP1130 and JNJ-7706621, exhibiting prominent preferential growth inhibition of antiestrogen-resistant cell lines, were selected for further studies. WP1130, a deubiquitinase inhibitor, induced caspase-mediated cell death in both tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell lines by destabilization of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Mcl-1 expression was found upregulated in the antiestrogen-resistant cell lines and depletion of Mcl-1 in resistant cells caused decreased viability. JNJ-7706621, a dual Aurora kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, specifically inhibited growth and caused G2 phase cell cycle arrest of the tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. Knockdown studies showed that Aurora kinase A is essential for growth of the tamoxifen-resistant cells and inhibition of Aurora kinase A resensitized tamoxifen-resistant cells to tamoxifen treatment. Preferential growth inhibition by WP1130 and JNJ-7706621 was also found in T47D-derived tamoxifen-resistant cell lines, pointing at Mcl-1 and Aurora kinase A as potential treatment targets. In addition, tumor samples from 244 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen showed that higher expression level of Aurora kinase A was significantly associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival, demonstrating the potential of Aurora kinase A as a biomarker for tamoxifen resistance.","['Thrane, S', 'Pedersen, A M', 'Thomsen, M B H', 'Kirkegaard, T', 'Rasmussen, B B', 'Duun-Henriksen, A K', 'Laenkholm, A V', 'Bak, M', 'Lykkesfeldt, A E', 'Yde, C W']","['Thrane S', 'Pedersen AM', 'Thomsen MB', 'Kirkegaard T', 'Rasmussen BB', 'Duun-Henriksen AK', 'Laenkholm AV', 'Bak M', 'Lykkesfeldt AE', 'Yde CW']","['Breast Cancer Group, Unit of Cell Death and Metabolism, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Breast Cancer Group, Unit of Cell Death and Metabolism, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Breast Cancer Group, Unit of Cell Death and Metabolism, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Breast Cancer Group, Unit of Cell Death and Metabolism, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Statistics, Bioinformatics and Registry, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Slagelse Hospital, Slagelse, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Breast Cancer Group, Unit of Cell Death and Metabolism, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Breast Cancer Group, Unit of Cell Death and Metabolism, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141103,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyanoacrylates)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (JNJ-7706621)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (degrasyn)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '22X328QOC4 (Fulvestrant)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Aurora Kinase A/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyanoacrylates/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Fulvestrant', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']",2014/11/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/11/04 06:00'],"['2013/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014351 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.351 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Aug 6;34(32):4199-210. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.351.

In children, where CML is very rare, it presents with more aggressive features, including huge splenomegaly, higher cell count and higher blast cell percentage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate if after childhood the disease maintains or loses these characteristics of aggressiveness, we analyzed 2784 adult patients, at least 18 years old, registered by GIMEMA CML WP over a 40-year period. RESULTS: Young adults (YAs: 18-29 years old) significantly differed from adults (30-59 years old) and elderly patients (at least 60 years old) particularly for the frequency of splenomegaly (71%, 63% and 55%, P < 0.001), and the greater spleen size (median value: 4.5, 3.0 and 1.0 cm, P < 0.001). According to the EUTOS score, that is age-independent, high-risk patients were more frequent among YAs, than among adult and elderly patients (18%, 9% and 6%, P < 0.001). In tyrosine kinase inhibitors-treated patients, the rates of complete cytogenetic and major molecular response were lower in YAs, and the probability of transformation was higher (16%, 5% and 7%, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of CML or the host response to leukemia differ with age. The knowledge of these differences and of their causes may help to refine the treatment and to improve the outcome.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 72 of the p53 gene is associated with the risk for development of various neoplasms. MDM2 SNP309 is a single nucleotide T to G polymorphism located in the MDM2 gene promoter, which enhances the expression of MDM2 protein and thereby leads to attenuation of the p53 stress response. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to define the roles of MDM2 and p53 genetic polymorphisms with the risk of AML. METHODOLOGY: Genotyping for MDM2 was done by AS-PCR technique while p53 codon 72 genotyping was done by PCR- RFLP for 50 patients and 50 controls. RESULTS: The study did not detect any significant differences regarding MDM2 or p53 polymorphisms in AML cases, as compared to controls. A borderline significance was found between cases and controls regarding combined MDM2 T/G and p53 genotyping. MDM2 variant genotype was significantly associated with a younger age group and lower Hb level, while the P53 variant was significantly associated with less frequent CD117 expression.","['El-Danasouri, Nabil Mohsen', 'Ragab, Shadia Hassan', 'Rasheed, Maha Ameen', 'Ali El Saadany, Zainab', 'Abd El-Fattah, Safa Nabil']","['El-Danasouri NM', 'Ragab SH', 'Rasheed MA', 'Ali El Saadany Z', 'Abd El-Fattah SN']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University.', 'National Research Center, Egypt.', 'National Research Center, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University zinab573@hotmail.com.', 'National Research Center, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Codon/*genetics', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/11/02 06:00'],"['2014/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['44/4/449 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2014 Fall;44(4):449-54.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AS-PCR', 'MDM2', 'RFLP-PCR', 'p53 codon 72']",,,,,,"['(c) 2014 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic analysis supports the hypothesis that NRAS mutations cooperate with antecedent molecular lesions in leukemogenesis, but have limited independent prognostic significance. Using short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown in human cell lines and primary mouse leukemias, we show that AML cells with NRAS/Nras mutations are dependent on continued oncogene expression in vitro and in vivo. Using the Mx1-Cre transgene to inactivate a conditional mutant Nras allele, we analyzed hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) under normal and stressed conditions and found that HSPCs lacking Nras expression are functionally equivalent to normal HSPCs in the adult mouse. Treating recipient mice transplanted with primary Nras(G12D) AMLs with 2 potent allosteric mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors (PD0325901 or trametinib/GlaxoSmithKline 1120212) significantly prolonged survival and reduced proliferation but did not induce apoptosis, promote differentiation, or drive clonal evolution. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor GDC-0941 was ineffective as a single agent and did not augment the activity of PD0325901. All mice ultimately succumbed to progressive leukemia. Together, these data validate oncogenic N-Ras signaling as a therapeutic target in AML and support testing combination regimens that include MEK inhibitors.","['Burgess, Michael R', 'Hwang, Eugene', 'Firestone, Ari J', 'Huang, Tannie', 'Xu, Jin', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Bohin, Natacha', 'Wen, Tiffany', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Haigis, Kevin M', 'Sampath, Deepak', 'Lowe, Scott', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Li, Qing']","['Burgess MR', 'Hwang E', 'Firestone AJ', 'Huang T', 'Xu J', 'Zuber J', 'Bohin N', 'Wen T', 'Kogan SC', 'Haigis KM', 'Sampath D', 'Lowe S', 'Shannon K', 'Li Q']","['Divisions of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA;', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria;', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA;', 'Molecular Pathology Unit and Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA;', 'Department of Translational Oncology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA;', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141031,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Nras protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Genes, ras', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Transgenes']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/11/02 06:00'],"['2014/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39561-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-574582 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 18;124(26):3947-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-574582.

It is perhaps the most active tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) among those currently licensed; 51% of patients resistant to or intolerant of second-generation TKIs experienced a major cytogenetic response and 70% of patients with the highly resistant T315I BCR-ABL1 mutation experienced a major cytogenetic response. However, 1 year after its accelerated approval by the FDA, and midway through its phase III pivotal trial, a high number of vascular occlusive events began to be reported. The FDA put a partial clinical hold on the drug and the phase III trial was halted. Dose-reduction recommendations were made, and the drug is now used in patients for whom no alternative TKI is available and those who have the T315I mutation. Currently, the substantial and durable responses that this drug provides are difficult to balance against the late-in-course vascular occlusive events. The hope is that ongoing research into the mechanism of presumed endothelial damage will provide a better understanding of how to position this drug for optimal use.","['Berman, Ellin']",['Berman E'],"['From the Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridazines/*therapeutic use']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/11/02 06:00'],"['2014/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['12/11/1615 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2014.0160 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2014 Nov;12(11):1615-20. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2014.0160.,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2014 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The literature on malignancies in patients with DS is reviewed and the major epidemiologic studies that have examined the spectrum of cancer risk in individuals with DS are summarized. Potential environmental and genetic determinants of cancer risk are discussed, and the potential role of chromosomal mosaicism in cancer risk among patients with DS is explored. Trisomy of chromosome 21, which causes DS, provides an extra copy of genes with tumor suppressor or repressor functions. Recent studies have leveraged mouse and human genetics to uncover specific candidate genes on chromosome 21 that mediate these effects.

We hypothesize that the biological differences in the subtypes of AMKL may be reflected in distinct immunophenotypic (IP) features. Our aims were to employ mutiparameter flow cytometry to establish a comprehensive IP spectrum of AMKL in multiple demographic groups and to determine whether the subtypes of AMKL demonstrate distinct immunophenotypes. METHODS: Thirty-seven AMKL cases were retrieved and subdivided into these three groups. Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to determine and compare the immunophenotypes. Available clinical, cytogenetic, and morphologic data were reviewed to confirm diagnoses. RESULTS: While there is commonality in the expression pattern for a wide range of myelomonocytic markers in these three subtypes of AMKL, blasts in DS-AMKL were more likely to express CD7 and CD11b than those in non-DS-AMKL and adult-AMKL. Furthermore, blasts in DS-AMKL were more likely to express CD13, CD33, and CD36 than non-DS pediatric AMKL, and showed greater CD56 expression compared with adult AMKL. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that DS-AMKL is related to but immunophenotypically distinct from non-DS-AMKL and adult-AMKL. This distinct immunophenotypic pattern, co-expression of CD7 and CD11b, has practical implications for characterization of AMKL.","['Wang, Linlin', 'Peters, John M', 'Fuda, Franklin', 'Li, Long', 'Karandikar, Nitin J', 'Koduru, Prasad', 'Wang, Huan-You', 'Chen, Weina']","['Wang L', 'Peters JM', 'Fuda F', 'Li L', 'Karandikar NJ', 'Koduru P', 'Wang HY', 'Chen W']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'ProPath(R), Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141031,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Compartment syndrome has a variety of causes, including posttraumatic or postoperative swelling, external compression, burns, bleeding disorders, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Rare cases of pediatric acute compartment syndrome in the setting of acute myeloid leukemia and, even less commonly, chronic myeloid leukemia have been reported. The authors report the first known case of pediatric acute compartment syndrome in a patient without a previously known diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. On initial examination, an 11-year-old boy presented with a 2-week history of progressive left calf pain and swelling after playing soccer. Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a hematoma in the left superficial posterior compartment. The patient had unrelenting pain, intermittent lateral foot parethesias, and inability to bear weight. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome and underwent fasciotomy and evacuation of a hematoma. Laboratory results showed an abnormal white blood cell count of 440x10(9)/L (normal, 4.4-11x10(9)) and international normalized ratio of 1.3 (normal, 0.8-1.2). Further testing included the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene located on the Philadelphia chromosome, leading to a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. Monotherapy with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) was initiated. This report adds another unique case to the growing literature on compartment syndrome in the pediatric population and reinforces the need to consider compartment syndrome, even in unlikely clinical scenarios.","['Cohen, Eric', 'Truntzer, Jeremy', 'Klinge, Steve', 'Schwartz, Kevin', 'Schiller, Jonathan']","['Cohen E', 'Truntzer J', 'Klinge S', 'Schwartz K', 'Schiller J']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,7806107,,IM,"['Child', 'Compartment Syndromes/complications/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', '*Leg', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Radiography']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/01477447-20141023-91 [doi]'],ppublish,Orthopedics. 2014 Nov;37(11):e1036-9. doi: 10.3928/01477447-20141023-91.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2014, SLACK Incorporated.']",,,,,,,,,"['Orthopedics. 2015 Jan;38(1):7.

However, under DNA damage, YAP activates pro-apoptotic genes in conjunction with p73. This program switching is mediated by c-Abl (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene) via phosphorylation of YAP at the Y357 residue (pY357). YAP as an oncogene coactivates the TEAD (transcriptional enhancer activator domain) family transcription factors. Here we asked whether c-Abl regulates the YAP-TEAD functional module. We found that DNA damage, through c-Abl activation, specifically depressed YAP-TEAD-induced transcription. Remarkably, c-Abl counteracts YAP-induced transformation by interfering with the YAP-TEAD transcriptional program. c-Abl induced TEAD1 phosphorylation, but the YAP-TEAD complex remained unaffected. In contrast, TEAD coactivation was compromised by phosphomimetic YAP Y357E mutation but not Y357F, as demonstrated at the level of reporter genes and endogenous TEAD target genes. Furthermore, YAP Y357E also severely compromised the role of YAP in cell transformation, migration, anchorage-independent growth, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human mammary MCF10A cells. These results suggest that YAP pY357 lost TEAD transcription activation function. Our results demonstrate that YAP pY357 inactivates YAP oncogenic function and establish a role for YAP Y357 phosphorylation in cell-fate decision.","['Keshet, R', 'Adler, J', 'Ricardo Lax, I', 'Shanzer, M', 'Porat, Z', 'Reuven, N', 'Shaul, Y']","['Keshet R', 'Adler J', 'Ricardo Lax I', 'Shanzer M', 'Porat Z', 'Reuven N', 'Shaul Y']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Biological Services Unit, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141031,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (TEA Domain Transcription Factors)', '0 (TEAD1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding/genetics/physiology', 'TEA Domain Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Wound Healing/physiology', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2014182 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2014.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2015 Jun;22(6):935-45. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2014.182.

To assess the pathogenic contribution of the low expression of PTEN, we determined PTEN-regulating miRNA interference, PTEN promoter methylation and PTEN gene mutation condition in CLL. One hundred and fifty-four previously untreated CLL patients and 200 cases of healthy controls were sequenced in exons 5-9 of PTEN. None of single nucleotide polymorphism site or mutation was detected in the coding sequences of those exons. Methylation of PTEN promoter was found in one (1.33%) of the 75 patients with CLL, but none of the 25 age-matched control subjects. We found that PTEN was a potential target of miR-26a and miR-214, which had been confirmed following dual-luciferase reporter assays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. High expression of miR-26a was associated with advanced Binet stage (P=0.012), p53 aberrations (P=0.014) and inferior time to first treatment (P=0.038), and high expression of miR-214 was only associated with p53 aberrations (P=0.041). Inhibition of miR-26a or miR-214 could induce more apoptosis in primary cultured CLL cells.

We have shown that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus extended survival in a non-obese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient (NOD/SCID) mouse xenograft model of human ALL. Since PI-3K has mTOR dependent and independent functions we examined the effect of the dual PI-3K/mTOR inhibitors BEZ235 and BGT226. These agents inhibited the proliferation of ALL cell lines with a three log greater potency than everolimus. However, the induction of cell death differed, with BGT226 being cytotoxic in the low micromolar range while a two log higher concentration of BEZ235 was required to produce the same effect. While all three agents extended the survival of NOD/SCID mice engrafted with human ALL, the responses of individual xenografts varied. Although differential phosphorylation of AKT on Ser(473) and Thr(308) in response to everolimus exposure was observed, this did not entirely explain the different in vivo responses to the drugs. Our data suggests that while dual PI-3K/mTOR inhibitors may improve therapeutic outcomes for a subset of ALL patients, patient selection will be important, with some patients likely to respond better to single mTOR inhibition.","['Wong, Jacky', 'Welschinger, Robert', 'Hewson, John', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Wong J', 'Welschinger R', 'Hewson J', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Centre for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead.

We performed transcriptome analysis on primitive CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (n = 46), their more differentiated CD34- leukemic progeny, and normal CD34+ bone marrow cells (n = 31) and focused on differentially expressed genes involved in adhesion and migration. Thus, Engulfment and Motility protein 1 (ELMO1) was identified amongst the top 50 most differentially expressed genes. ELMO1 is a crucial link in the signaling cascade that leads to activation of RAC GTPases and cytoskeleton rearrangements. We confirmed increased ELMO1 expression at the mRNA and protein level in a panel of AML samples and showed that high ELMO1 expression is an independent negative prognostic factor in normal karyotype (NK) AML in three large independent patient cohorts. Downmodulation of ELMO1 in human CB CD34+ cells did not significantly alter expansion, progenitor frequency or differentiation in stromal co-cultures, but did result in a decreased frequency of stem cells in LTC-IC assays. In BCR-ABL-transduced human CB CD34+ cells depletion of ELMO1 resulted in a mild decrease in proliferation, but replating capacity of progenitors was severely impaired. Downregulation of ELMO1 in a panel of primary CD34+ AML cells also resulted in reduced long-term growth in stromal co-cultures in two out of three cases. Pharmacological inhibition of the ELMO1 downstream target RAC resulted in a severely impaired proliferation and survival of leukemic cells. Finally, ELMO1 depletion caused a marked decrease in SDF1-induced chemotaxis of leukemic cells. Taken together, these data show that inhibiting the ELMO1-RAC axis might be an alternative way to target leukemic cells.","['Capala, Marta E', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Capala ME', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141031,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (ELMO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/pathology', '*Chemotaxis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', '*Up-Regulation']",2014/11/02 06:00,2016/01/02 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111568 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-29932 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 31;9(10):e111568. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111568. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4216115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation or mutations of CDNK3 have been implicated in various cancers. However, the role of CDKN3 in Bcr-Abl-mediated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) remains unknown. Here we found that CDKN3 acts as a tumor suppressor in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis. Overexpression of CDKN3 sensitized the K562 leukemic cells to imanitib-induced apoptosis and dramatically inhibited K562 xenografted tumor growth in nude mouse model. Ectopic expression of CDKN3 significantly reduced the efficiency of Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation of FDCP1 cells to growth factor independence. In contrast, depletion of CDKN3 expression conferred resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis in the leukemic cells and accelerated the growth of xenograph leukemia in mice. In addition, we found that CDKN3 mutant (CDKN3-C140S) devoid of the phosphatase activity failed to affect the K562 leukemic cell survival and xenografted tumor growth, suggesting that the phosphatase of CDKN3 was required for its tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, we observed that overexpression of CDKN3 reduced the leukemic cell survival by dephosphorylating CDK2, thereby inhibiting CDK2-dependent XIAP expression. Moreover, overexpression of CDKN3 delayed G1/S transition in K562 leukemic cells. Our results highlight the importance of CDKN3 in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis, and provide new insights into diagnostics and therapeutics of the leukemia.","['Chen, Qinghuang', 'Chen, Ke', 'Guo, Guijie', 'Li, Fang', 'Chen, Chao', 'Wang, Song', 'Nalepa, Grzegorz', 'Huang, Shile', 'Chen, Ji-Long']","['Chen Q', 'Chen K', 'Guo G', 'Li F', 'Chen C', 'Wang S', 'Nalepa G', 'Huang S', 'Chen JL']","['College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.', 'College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, United States of America.', 'College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141031,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDKN3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/12/23 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111611 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-32702 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 31;9(10):e111611. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111611. eCollection 2014.,,,['K12 HD068371/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4216094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard treatment of CML with TKIs is highly effective in reducing disease burden, delaying disease progression, and prolonging overall survival of patients; however, resistance to TKI treatment has become an increasingly important cause of treatment failure. The emergence of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain is a common mechanism of TKI resistance, and laboratory testing to detect these mutations is currently available for clinical use. Patients who do not respond or have lost their response to TKI therapy should be considered for mutational testing. Despite clinical practice guidelines that recommend testing for BCR-ABL1 mutations in patients with clinical signs of TKI resistance, many oncologists and hematologists managing patients with CML do not perform such testing. This review addresses outstanding questions related to when testing should be conducted, what type of testing should be done, and how testing results should be applied to subsequent therapeutic decisions. It describes how BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations confer resistance, outlines the prevalence of mutations in patients with resistance to TKIs, summarizes the common and investigational methods used in mutational testing, and presents an algorithm reflecting a clinical perspective on how and when to conduct mutational testing, and what to do with test results.","['Ai, Jing', 'Tiu, Ramon V']","['Ai J', 'Tiu RV']","['Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Mail Code R40, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,2014/11/02 06:00,2014/11/02 06:01,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620714537865 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620714537865 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2014 Aug;5(4):107-20. doi: 10.1177/2040620714537865.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'DNA mutational analysis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'missense mutation']",,PMC4212312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coexistence of these two primary genetic aberrations within the same clone is very rare in children with ALL. Here we report a new case of a 17-year-old girl with newly diagnosed ALL and uncommon cytogenetic and clinical finding combining high hyperdiploidy and a cryptic BCR/ABL1 fusion and an inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy detected during the induction treatment. RESULTS: High hyperdiploid karyotype 51,XX,+X,+4,+14,+17,+21 without apparent structural aberrations was detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis and multicolor FISH. A cryptic BCR/ABL1 fusion, which was caused by the insertion of part of the ABL1 gene into the 22q11 region, was proved in HeH clone by FISH, RT-PCR and CGH-SNP array. In addition, an abnormal FISH pattern previously described as the deletion of the 3'BCR region in some BCR/ABL1 positive cases was not proved in our patient. CONCLUSION: A novel case of extremely rare childhood ALL, characterized by HeH and a cryptic BCR/ABL1 fusion, is presented and to the best of our knowledge described for the first time. The insertion of ABL1 into the BCR region in malignant cells is supposed. Clearly, further studies are needed to determine the genetic consequences and prognostic implications of these unusual cases.","['Lizcova, Libuse', 'Zemanova, Zuzana', 'Lhotska, Halka', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Hovorkova, Lenka', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Malinova, Eva', 'Rabasova, Jana', 'Raska, Ivan', 'Sramkova, Lucie', 'Stary, Jan', 'Michalova, Kyra']","['Lizcova L', 'Zemanova Z', 'Lhotska H', 'Zuna J', 'Hovorkova L', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Malinova E', 'Rabasova J', 'Raska I', 'Sramkova L', 'Stary J', 'Michalova K']","['Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, General University Hospital in Prague and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, General University Hospital in Prague and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, General University Hospital in Prague and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, General University Hospital in Prague and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty Hospital Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Cellular Biology and Pathology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, General University Hospital in Prague and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20141024,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,2014/11/02 06:00,2014/11/02 06:01,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-014-0072-9 [doi]', '72 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2014 Oct 24;7(1):72. doi: 10.1186/s13039-014-0072-9. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL1 fusion', 'CGH-SNP array', 'FISH', 'High-hyperdiploid childhood ALL', 'Ph-negative childhood ALL']",,PMC4213530,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GATA2 mutations have also been reported in a minority of patients with congenital neutropenia and aplastic anemia (AA). The bone marrow (BM) from patients with GATA2 deficiency is typically hypocellular, with varying degrees of dysplasia. Distinguishing GATA2 patients from those with AA is critical for selecting appropriate therapy. We compared the BM flow cytometric, morphologic, and cytogenetic features of 28 GATA2 patients with those of 32 patients being evaluated for idiopathic AA. The marrow of GATA2 patients had severely reduced monocytes, B cells, and NK cells; absent hematogones; and inverted CD4:CD8 ratios. Atypical megakaryocytes and abnormal cytogenetics were more common in GATA2 marrows. CD34(+) cells were comparably reduced in GATA2 and AA. Using these criteria, we prospectively identified 4 of 32 patients with suspected AA who had features suspicious for GATA2 mutations, later confirmed by DNA sequencing. Our results show that routine BM flow cytometry, morphology, and cytogenetics in patients who present with cytopenia(s) can identify patients for whom GATA2 sequencing is indicated.","['Ganapathi, Karthik A', 'Townsley, Danielle M', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Zerbe, Christa S', 'Cuellar-Rodriguez, Jennifer', 'Hickstein, Dennis D', 'Rosenzweig, Sergio D', 'Braylan, Raul C', 'Young, Neal S', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Calvo, Katherine R']","['Ganapathi KA', 'Townsley DM', 'Hsu AP', 'Arthur DC', 'Zerbe CS', 'Cuellar-Rodriguez J', 'Hickstein DD', 'Rosenzweig SD', 'Braylan RC', 'Young NS', 'Holland SM', 'Calvo KR']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Immunology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20141030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', 'Aplastic anemia, idiopathic']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39528-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-580340 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 1;125(1):56-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-580340.

While adult acute B-cell precursor leukemia (BCP-ALL) appears to be resistant to NK-cell-mediated lysis, recent data indicate that pediatric BCP-ALL might yet be a target of NK cells. In this study, we demonstrate in a donor-patient-specific NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) IL2rg(tmWjl)/Sz (NSG) xenotransplantation model that NK cells mediate considerable alloreactivity toward pediatric BCP-ALL in vivo. Notably, both adoptively transferred mature KIR(+) NK cells and immature KIR(-) NK cells arising early posttransplantation in humanized NSG mice exerted substantial antileukemic activity. Low-dose and long-term treatment of humanized NSG mice with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-cytidine distinctly enhanced the antitumor response, interestingly without inducing common inhibitory KIR expression but rather by promoting the differentiation of various NK-cell precursor subsets. Collectively, these data indicate that the future design of innovative therapy protocols should consider further exploitation of NK-cell-mediated immune responses for poor prognosis pediatric BCP-ALL patients.","['Kubler, Ayline', 'Woiterski, Jeanette', 'Witte, Kai-Erik', 'Buhring, Hans-Jorg', 'Hartwig, Udo F', 'Ebinger, Martin', 'Oevermann, Lena', 'Mezger, Markus', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Lang, Peter', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Munz, Christian', 'Andre, Maya C']","['Kubler A', 'Woiterski J', 'Witte KE', 'Buhring HJ', 'Hartwig UF', 'Ebinger M', 'Oevermann L', 'Mezger M', 'Herr W', 'Lang P', 'Handgretinger R', 'Munz C', 'Andre MC']","[""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany;"", ""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany;"", ""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany;"", 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany;', 'University Medical Center, 3 Department of Medicine/Hematology, Internal Oncology and Pneumology, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany;', ""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany;"", ""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany; University Children's Hospital, Department for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany;"", ""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany;"", 'University Medical Center, 3 Department of Medicine/Hematology, Internal Oncology and Pneumology, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany; University of Regensburg, Department of Internal Medicine III, Regensburg, Germany;', ""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany;"", ""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany;"", 'Viral Immunobiology, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich, Switzerland; and.', ""University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany; University Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, Basel, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Azacitidine/chemistry', 'Child', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, KIR/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39557-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-572743 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 18;124(26):3914-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-572743.

From 2002 to 2011, 363 patients 16 to 85 years old were recruited in 98 centers. Treatment consisted of 6 5-day chemotherapy cycles with high-dose methotrexate, high-dose cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, ifosphamide, corticosteroids, and triple intrathecal therapy. Patients >55 years old received a reduced regimen. Rituximab was given before each cycle and twice as maintenance, for a total of 8 doses. The rate of complete remission was 88% (319/363); overall survival (OS) at 5 years, 80%; and progression-free survival, 71%; with significant difference between adolescents, adults, and elderly patients (OS rate of 90%, 84%, and 62%, respectively). Full treatment could be applied in 86% of the patients. The most important prognostic factors were International Prognostic Index (IPI) score (0-2 vs 3-5; P = .0005), age-adjusted IPI score (0-1 vs 2-3; P = .0001), and gender (male vs female; P = .004). The high cure rate in this prospective trial with a substantial number of participating hospitals demonstrates the efficacy and feasibility of chemoimmunotherapy, even in elderly patients.

The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime-attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence that is associated with the radiation dose from dental CT scans and to evaluate the effect of scan position, sex, and age on the cancer risk. This retrospective cohort study involved 505 participants who underwent CT scans. The mean effective doses for male and female patients in the maxilla group were 408 and 389 microSv (P = 0.055), respectively, whereas the mean effective doses for male and female patients in the mandible groups were 475 and 450 microSv (P < 0.001), respectively. The LAR for cancer incidence after mandible CT scanning varied from 1 in 16,196 for a 30-y-old woman to 1 in 114,680 for a 70-y-old man. The organ-specific cancer risks for thyroid cancer, other cancers, leukemia, and lung cancer account for 99% of the LAR. Among patients of all ages, the estimated LAR of a mandible scan was higher than that of a maxilla scan. Furthermore, the LAR for female thyroid cancer had a peak before age 45 y. The risk for a woman aged 30 y is roughly 8 times higher than that of a woman aged 50 y. After undergoing a dental CT scan, the possible cancer risks related to sex and age across various different anatomical regions are not similar. The greatest risk due to a dental CT scan is for a mandible scan when the woman is younger than 45 y. Given the limits of the sample size, machine parameters, and the retrospective nature of this study, the results need to be interpreted within the context of this patient population. Future studies will be of value to corroborate these findings.","['Wu, T-H', 'Lin, W-C', 'Chen, W-K', 'Chang, Y-C', 'Hwang, J-J']","['Wu TH', 'Lin WC', 'Chen WK', 'Chang YC', 'Hwang JJ']","['Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Radiology, Cathay General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan School of Medicine, Fu-Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan Department of Radiation Oncology, Hsinchu Branch, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Mathematics, Tamkang University, New Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan jjhwang@ym.edu.tw 106300@mail.tku.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,United States,J Dent Res,Journal of dental research,0354343,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mandible/radiation effects', 'Maxilla/radiation effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiography, Dental/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['0022034514554226 [pii]', '10.1177/0022034514554226 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dent Res. 2015 Jan;94(1):27-35. doi: 10.1177/0022034514554226.

The structures discussed include those that promote or impede HCMV replication (such as viral replication compartments and promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies, respectively) and those whose role in the infected cell is unclear (for example, nucleoli and nuclear speckles).

Early PGCs form EGCs more readily than do later PGCs, and PGCs lose the ability to form EGCs by embryonic day (E) 15.5. Here, we examined the effects of activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT in PGCs during EGC formation; notably, AKT activation, in combination with LIF and bFGF, enhanced EGC formation and caused approximately 60% of E10.5 PGCs to become EGCs. The results indicate that the majority of PGCs at E10.5 could acquire pluripotency with an activated AKT signaling pathway. Importantly, AKT activation did not fully substitute for bFGF and LIF, and AKT activation without both LIF and bFGF did not result in EGC formation. These findings indicate that AKT signal enhances and/or collaborates with signaling pathways of bFGF and of LIF in PGCs for the acquisition of pluripotency.","['Matsui, Yasuhisa', 'Takehara, Asuka', 'Tokitake, Yuko', 'Ikeda, Makiko', 'Obara, Yuka', 'Morita-Fujimura, Yuiko', 'Kimura, Tohru', 'Nakano, Toru']","['Matsui Y', 'Takehara A', 'Tokitake Y', 'Ikeda M', 'Obara Y', 'Morita-Fujimura Y', 'Kimura T', 'Nakano T']","['Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8575, Japan CREST, JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan ymatsui@idac.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8575, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8575, Japan CREST, JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8575, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8575, Japan.', 'Frontier Research Institute of Interdisciplinary Sciences (FRIS), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8578, Japan.', 'School of Science, Kitasato University, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-0373, Japan.', 'CREST, JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (lysyl-arginyl-threonyl-glycyl-glutaminyl-tyrosyl-lysyl-leucyl-cysteine)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*physiology', 'Chimera/embryology', 'Embryonic Development/*physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.113779 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.113779 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2014 Dec;141(23):4457-67. doi: 10.1242/dev.113779.

However, it is uncertain whether plasma MTX levels can predict MTX-related toxicity in the HDMTX plus additional chemotherapy for childhood B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). PROCEDURES: To statistically analyze the relationship between MTX pharmacokinetic parameters and MTX-related toxicities, we collected data from patients with delayed MTX elimination (>/=1 microM at 48 hr and/or >/=0.5 microM at 72 hr) in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) BNHL 03 study. Blood MTX levels were measured at 24, 48, and 72 hr after 3 or 5 g/m(2) HD-MTX administration for 24 hr. RESULTS: Three hundred and four patients received 2-4 courses of the HDMTX plus additional chemotherapy, and delayed MTX elimination was observed in 165 courses of 127 patients. In those, nephrotoxicity was significantly correlated with plasma MTX levels for each patient (P = 0.03), and also for each course (P = 0.009), but no other toxicities were correlated. Another analysis according to HDMTX courses showed no significant correlation between the first high plasma MTX levels and subsequent MTX levels in later course. It also showed that incidence of liver and gastrointestinal toxicities was most frequent in the first HDMTX course, and then sharply decreased in later courses (P < 0.001).

Its clinical relevance is highly dependent on the size and location of the lesion. Therefore, the diagnosis, description of the affected site and the classification of the disease, must be precise. We conducted an extensive literature review to assess the quality of studies reporting the incidence of osteonecrosis in patients with childhood leukemia. Of the 31 included studies, one-third (32% [n = 10]) did not describe the diagnostic method that was used to assess osteonecrosis. In almost two-third (61% [n = 19]) of the studies, the osteonecrosis classification system was not used. We conclude that the quality of most published studies on the incidence of osteonecrosis in patients with childhood leukemia is relatively poor because many studies did not describe the radiological method used to diagnose osteonecrosis and/or did not use a validated osteonecrosis classification system. To compare the incidence of osteonecrosis, and to assess the severity and clinical consequences of osteonecrosis in patients with childhood leukemia, there is a need for a robust and widely recognized classification system to grade all cases of osteonecrosis despite the site of lesion.

Platinum and cytarabine-based regimens have not been evaluated in large cohorts of patients with CLL or RS. This retrospective study was aimed to assess the efficacy of these regimens in 75 patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL or RS. Forty-seven patients had R/R CLL (including 36 ultra high-risk CLL) and 28 had RS. Median age was 62 years (range, 18-79 years). Median number of previous therapies was 3 (range, 1-7), including fludarabine-based regimens (75%) and alemtuzumab (32%), and 61% of patients were refractory to their last treatment. Deletions of chromosomes 17p and 11q were found in 40% and 39% of cases, respectively. The overall response rates were 60% with 24% complete response (CR) in CLL, and 43% with 25% CR in RS. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 11 and 14.6 months, respectively. Fludarabine refractoriness and 17p deletion were not associated with a poorer outcome. The only factors predicting shorter survival were performance status >/= 2 (P = 0.04) and albumin level <3.5 g/dL (P = 0.0004). Toxicities were mainly myelosuppression and infectious complications. Platinum and high-dose cytarabine-based regimens provide high response rates in high-risk CLL and in RS.

NS also is associated with a risk for developing myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Mutations responsible for NS occur in at least 11 different loci including KRAS. Here we describe a mouse model for NS induced by K-Ras(V14I), a recurrent KRAS mutation in NS patients. K-Ras(V14I)-mutant mice displayed multiple NS-associated developmental defects such as growth delay, craniofacial dysmorphia, cardiac defects, and hematologic abnormalities including a severe form of MPD that resembles human JMML. Homozygous animals had perinatal lethality whose penetrance varied with genetic background. Exposure of pregnant mothers to a MEK inhibitor rescued perinatal lethality and prevented craniofacial dysmorphia and cardiac defects. However, Mek inhibition was not sufficient to correct these defects when mice were treated after weaning. Interestingly, Mek inhibition did not correct the neoplastic MPD characteristic of these mutant mice, regardless of the timing at which the mice were treated, thus suggesting that MPD is driven by additional signaling pathways. These genetically engineered K-Ras(V14I)-mutant mice offer an experimental tool for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of NS. Perhaps more importantly, they should be useful as a preclinical model to test new therapies aimed at preventing or ameliorating those deficits associated with this syndrome.","['Hernandez-Porras, Isabel', 'Fabbiano, Salvatore', 'Schuhmacher, Alberto J', 'Aicher, Alexandra', 'Canamero, Marta', 'Camara, Juan Antonio', 'Cusso, Lorena', 'Desco, Manuel', 'Heeschen, Christopher', 'Mulero, Francisca', 'Bustelo, Xose R', 'Guerra, Carmen', 'Barbacid, Mariano']","['Hernandez-Porras I', 'Fabbiano S', 'Schuhmacher AJ', 'Aicher A', 'Canamero M', 'Camara JA', 'Cusso L', 'Desco M', 'Heeschen C', 'Mulero F', 'Bustelo XR', 'Guerra C', 'Barbacid M']","['Molecular Oncology.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain;', 'Molecular Oncology.', 'Molecular Pathology, and.', 'Biotechnology Programs, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, E-28029 Madrid, Spain;', 'Biotechnology Programs, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, E-28029 Madrid, Spain;', 'Departamento de Bioingenieria e Ingenieria Aeroespacial, Universidad Carlos III, E-28911 Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, E-28007 Madrid, Spain; and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Salud Mental, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioingenieria e Ingenieria Aeroespacial, Universidad Carlos III, E-28911 Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, E-28007 Madrid, Spain; and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Salud Mental, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Pathology, and.', 'Biotechnology Programs, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, E-28029 Madrid, Spain;', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain;', 'Molecular Oncology, mcguerra@cnio.es mbarbacid@cnio.es.', 'Molecular Oncology, mcguerra@cnio.es mbarbacid@cnio.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/embryology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Body Size/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Crosses, Genetic', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dwarfism/genetics', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Face/abnormalities', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant', '*Genes, ras', 'Genotype', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mice, Mutant Strains/genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/embryology/genetics', 'Noonan Syndrome/*genetics', 'Phenotype', '*Point Mutation', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics/physiology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1418126111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1418126111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Nov 18;111(46):16395-400. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1418126111.

Here, using purified alpha-toxin and a set of hla-deficient strains, we show that alpha-toxin is critical for the induction of MCL-1 expression and the cytoprotection of infected macrophages. Extracellular or intracellular treatment of macrophages with alpha-toxin alone did not induce cytoprotection conferred by increased Mcl-1, suggesting that the process is dependent on the production of alpha-toxin by intracellular bacteria. The increased expression of MCL-1 in infected cells was associated with enhanced NFkappaB activation, and subsequent IL-6 secretion. This effect was only partially inhibited by blocking TLR2, which suggests the participation of intracellular receptors in the specific recognition of S. aureus strains secreting alpha-toxin. Thus, S. aureus recognition by intracellular receptors and/or activation of downstream pathways leading to Mcl-1 expression is facilitated by alpha-toxin released by intracellular bacteria which permeabilize phagosomes, ensuring pathogen access to the cytoplasmatic compartment. Given that the intracellular survival of S. aureus depends on alpha-toxin, we propose a novel role for this agent in the protection of the intracellular niche, and further dissemination of staphylococci by infected macrophages.","['Koziel, Joanna', 'Chmiest, Daniela', 'Bryzek, Danuta', 'Kmiecik, Katarzyna', 'Mizgalska, Danuta', 'Maciag-Gudowska, Agnieszka', 'Shaw, Lindsey N', 'Potempa, Jan']","['Koziel J', 'Chmiest D', 'Bryzek D', 'Kmiecik K', 'Mizgalska D', 'Maciag-Gudowska A', 'Shaw LN', 'Potempa J']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,Switzerland,J Innate Immun,Journal of innate immunity,101469471,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '0 (staphylococcal alpha-toxin)']",IM,"['Bacterial Toxins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytoprotection', 'Hemolysin Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Evasion', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*immunology/microbiology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*immunology/transmission', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['000368048 [pii]', '10.1159/000368048 [doi]']",ppublish,J Innate Immun. 2015;7(2):187-98. doi: 10.1159/000368048.

To elucidate the immunological alteration in asbestos-related tumors, an asbestos-induced apoptosis-resistant subline (MT-2Rst) was established from a human adult T cell leukemia virus-immortalized T cell line (MT-2Org) by long-term exposure to asbestos chrysotile-B (CB). In this study, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) knockdown using lentiviral vector-mediated RNA interference showed that MT-2Rst cells secreted increased levels of TGF-beta1, and acquired resistance to TGF-beta1-mediated growth inhibition. We showed that exposure of MT-2Org cells to CB activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK1/2, p38 and JNK1. Furthermore, TGF-beta1-knockdown cells and treatment with MAPK inhibitors revealed that MT-2Rst cells secreted a high level of TGF-beta1 mainly through phosphorylation of p38. However, an Annexin V assay indicated that TGF-beta1 resistance in MT-2Rst cells was not directly involved in the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis that is triggered by CB exposure. The overall results demonstrate that long-term exposure of MT-2Org cells to CB induces a regulatory T cell-like phenotype, suggesting that chronic exposure to asbestos leads to a state of immune suppression.","['Maeda, Megumi', 'Chen, Ying', 'Hayashi, Hiroaki', 'Kumagai-Takei, Naoko', 'Matsuzaki, Hidenori', 'Lee, Suni', 'Nishimura, Yasumitsu', 'Otsuki, Takemi']","['Maeda M', 'Chen Y', 'Hayashi H', 'Kumagai-Takei N', 'Matsuzaki H', 'Lee S', 'Nishimura Y', 'Otsuki T']","['Department of Biofunctional Chemistry, Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama 7008530, Japan.', 'Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama 7010192, Japan.', 'Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama 7010192, Japan.', 'Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama 7010192, Japan.', 'Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama 7010192, Japan.', 'Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama 7010192, Japan.', 'Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama 7010192, Japan.', 'Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama 7010192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140929,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '1332-21-4 (Asbestos)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Asbestos/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immune System/drug effects/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2682 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Dec;45(6):2522-32. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2682.

Whether hBMSCs retain immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties upon oncogenic transformation remains unknown. Using sequentially mutated hBMSCs and spontaneously transformed hBMSCs, we report that, upon oncogenic transformation, hBMSCs lose immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome profiling and functional assays reveal immune effectors underlying the loss of immunomodulation in transformed hBMSCs. They display a proinflammatory transcriptomic signature, with deregulation of immune and inflammatory modulators and regulators of the prostaglandin synthesis. Transformed hBMSCs lose their capacity to secrete the immunosuppressive prostacyclins prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGI2 but produce proinflammatory thromboxanes. Together, the immunoregulatory profile adopted by hBMSCs largely depends on intrinsic genetic-molecular determinants triggered by genomic instability/oncogenic transformation.","['Rodriguez, Rene', 'Rosu-Myles, Michael', 'Arauzo-Bravo, Marcos', 'Horrillo, Angelica', 'Pan, Qiuwei', 'Gonzalez-Rey, Elena', 'Delgado, Mario', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Rodriguez R', 'Rosu-Myles M', 'Arauzo-Bravo M', 'Horrillo A', 'Pan Q', 'Gonzalez-Rey E', 'Delgado M', 'Menendez P']","['Hospital Universitario de Asturias-Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo 33006, Spain.', 'Centre for Biologics Evaluation, Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate, Health Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0K9, Canada.', 'Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation of Science, Bilbao 20014, Spain; Group of Computational Biology and Systems Biomedicine, Biodonostia Health Research Institute, San Sebastian 20014, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Cell Therapy Program, Medicine School, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam 3000, the Netherlands.', 'Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra/CSIC, Granada 18016, Spain.', 'Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra/CSIC, Granada 18016, Spain.

METHODS: We extended follow-up to December 2012 for 7970 workers at eight companies in England which used styrene in the manufacture of glass-reinforced plastics. Mortality was compared with that for England and Wales by the person-years method, and summarised by SMRs with 95% CIs. A supplementary nested case-control analysis compared styrene exposures, lagged by 5 years, in 122 incident or fatal cases of LH cancer and 1138 matched controls. RESULTS: A total of 3121 cohort members had died (2022 since the last follow-up). No elevation of mortality was observed for LH cancer, either in the full cohort (62 deaths, SMR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.15), or in those with more than background exposure to styrene (38 deaths, SMR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.14). Nor did the case-control analysis suggest any association with LH cancer. In comparison with background exposure, the OR for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in workers with high exposure (estimated 8-h time-weighted average of 40-100 ppm) for >/=1 year was 0.54 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.27). Mortality from lung cancer was significantly elevated, and risk increased progressively across exposure categories, with an SMR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.86) in workers highly exposed for >/=1 year. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that styrene causes LH cancer. An association with lung cancer is not consistently supported by other studies. It may have been confounded by smoking, but would be worth checking further.","['Coggon, David', 'Ntani, Georgia', 'Harris, E Clare', 'Palmer, Keith T']","['Coggon D', 'Ntani G', 'Harris EC', 'Palmer KT']","['MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Plastics)', '0 (Styrenes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupations/classification', 'Plastics', 'Risk Factors', 'Styrenes/*toxicity', 'Time Factors']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2014-102382 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2014-102382 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2015 Mar;72(3):165-70. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2014-102382.

However, many tumor cells including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed certain degrees of resistance to TRAIL and the mechanism remains largely unknown. Embelin is a potent XIAP inhibitor which has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and cause cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of Embelin on the TRAIL-induced apoptosis and the underlying mechanism. Here, we chose an adenovirus vector as the expression vector for TRAIL, which was named Ad-TRAIL. The results in vitro showed that the co-treatment of Embelin and Ad-TRAIL has synergistically suppressed the proliferation of AML cells. Embelin has the ability to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis and activate caspase pathway. More interestingly, we found that the underlying mechanism for these talent skills of Embelin is through reducing the TRAIL-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and decreasing its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, our results in vivo suggest that combined therapy of Embelin and Ad-TRAIL caused significant growth inhibition of HL-60 xenograft tumors. Our results suggested that Embelin could sensitize AML cell to TRAIL through the repression of NF-kappaB signal pathway in vitro and in vivo, and combined therapy of Ad-TRAIL and Embelin may be the attractive candidate for clinical application in treatment of AML.","['Yang, Tianxin', 'Lan, Jianping', 'Huang, Qiang', 'Chen, Xiaoyi', 'Sun, Xiaodong', ""Liu, Xing'e"", 'Yang, Ping', 'Jin, Tao', 'Wang, Shibing', 'Mou, Xiaozhou']","['Yang T', 'Lan J', 'Huang Q', 'Chen X', 'Sun X', 'Liu X', 'Yang P', 'Jin T', 'Wang S', 'Mou X']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, 310014, Zhejiang, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', 'SHC6U8F5ER (embelin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/11/02 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/11/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12013-014-0197-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2015 Jan;71(1):291-7. doi: 10.1007/s12013-014-0197-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neonatal ovary development predisposes adult ovary function, yet the effect of maternal nutrition on the neonatal ovary has not been described. Therefore, here we show the impact of maternal protein restriction on the expression of folliculogenic and steroidogenic genes, their regulatory microRNAs and promoter DNA methylation in the ovary of neonatal piglets. Sows were fed either standard-protein (SP, 15% crude protein) or low-protein (LP, 7.5% crude protein) diets throughout gestation. Female piglets born to LP sows showed significantly decreased ovary weight relative to body weight (p<0.05) at birth, which was accompanied with an increased serum estradiol level (p<0.05). The LP piglets demonstrated higher ratio of bcl-2 associated X protein/B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 mRNA (p<0.01), which was associated with up-regulated mRNA expression of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) (p<0.05) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (p<0.05). The steroidogenic gene, cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19A1) was significantly down-regulated (p<0.05) in LP piglets. The alterations in ovarian gene expression were associated with a significant down-regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor mRNA expression (p<0.05) in LP piglets. Moreover, three microRNAs, including miR-423-5p targeting both CYP19A1 and PCNA, miR-378 targeting CYP19A1 and miR-210 targeting BMP4, were significantly down-regulated (p<0.05) in the ovary of LP piglets.

However, this method is not convenient in routine clinical practice. Hence, we detected hOCT1 protein expression levels (Choct1) of peripheral blood in CML patients and evaluated the relationship between Choct1 and IM response. A total of 83 patients who were diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML with IM therapy and 31 heathy donors were collected. Choct1 were detected by indirect immunofluorescent flow cytometry.

The stability of the DPV signals obtained by oxidation of the extracted guanine on the rGONWs was studied after 20 cycles.

It is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1.3 new cases per one million individuals per year. The treatment of PNH has been largely empirical and symptomatic, with blood transfusions, anticoagulation, and supplementation with folic acid or iron. Eculizumab, a biological agent that inhibits complement cascade, was developed for preventing hemolytic anemia and severe thrombotic episodes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical benefits and harms of eculizumab for treating patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search strategy. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to 15 May 2014), EMBASE (from 1980 to 25 June 2014), and LILACS (from 1982 to 25 June 2014). We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of their publication status or language. No limits were applied with respect to period of follow-up. We excluded quasi-RCTs. We included trials comparing eculizumab with placebo or best available therapy. We included any patient with a confirmed diagnosis of PNH. Primary outcome was overall survival. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently performed a duplicate selection of eligible trials, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We used a random-effects model for analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one multicenter (34 sites) phase III RCT involving 87 participants. The trial compared eculizumab versus placebo, and was conducted in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia with 26 weeks of follow-up. This small trial had high risk of bias in many domains (attrition and selective reporting). It was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. No patients died during the study. By using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales indicating improvement), the trial showed improvement in health-related quality of life in patients treated with eculizumab (mean difference (MD) 19.4, 95% CI 8.25 to 30.55; P = 0.0007; low quality of evidence). By using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue instrument (scores can range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating improvement in fatigue), the trial showed a reduction in fatigue (MD 10.4, 95% CI 9.97 to 10.83; P = 0.00001; moderate quality of evidence) in the eculizumab group compared with placebo. Eculizumab compared with placebo showed a greater proportion of patients with transfusion independence: 51% (22/43) versus 0% (0/44); risk ratio (RR) 46.02, 95% CI 2.88 to 735.53; P = 0.007; moderate quality of evidence; and withdrawal for any reason: 4.7% (2/43) versus 22.72% (10/44); RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.88; P = 0.03; moderate quality of evidence. Due to the low rate of events observed, the included trial did not show any difference between eculizumab and placebo in terms of serious adverse events: 9.3% (4/43) versus 20.4% (9/44); RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.37; P = 0.16; low quality of evidence. We did not observe any difference between intervention and placebo for the most frequent adverse events. One participant receiving placebo showed an episode of thrombosis. The trial did not assess overall survival, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia, or development or recurrence of aplastic anemia on treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review has detected an absence of evidence for eculizumab compared with placebo for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), in terms of overall survival, nonfatal thrombotic events, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia, and development and recurrence of aplastic anemia on treatment. Current evidence indicates that compared with placebo, eculizumab increases health-related quality of life and increases transfusion independence. During the execution of the included trial, no patients died. Furthermore, the intervention seems to reduce fatigue and withdrawals for any reason. The safety profile of eculizumab is unclear. These conclusions are based on one small trial with risk of attrition and selective reporting bias.Therefore, prescription of eculizumab for treating patients with PNH can neither be supported nor rejected, unless new evidence from a large high quality trial alters this conclusion. Therefore, we urge the reader to interpret the trial results with much caution. Future trials on this issue should be conducted according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement by independent investigators, and using the Foundation of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research recommendations.","['Marti-Carvajal, Arturo J', 'Anand, Vidhu', 'Cardona, Andres Felipe', 'Sola, Ivan']","['Marti-Carvajal AJ', 'Anand V', 'Cardona AF', 'Sola I']","['Iberoamerican Cochrane Network, Valencia, Venezuela.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20141030,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', 'A3ULP0F556 (eculizumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2014/10/31 06:00,2014/12/20 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD010340.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 Oct 30;(10):CD010340. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD010340.pub2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The N- and C-terminal regions of p12 are sequentially acting domains, both required for p12 function. Defects in the C-terminal domain can be overcome by introducing a chromatin binding motif into the protein. However, the function of the N-terminal domain remains unknown. Here, we undertook a detailed analysis of the effects of p12 mutation on incoming viral cores. We found that both reverse transcription complexes and isolated mature cores from N-terminal p12 mutants have altered capsid complexes compared to wild type virions. Electron microscopy revealed that mature N-terminal p12 mutant cores have different morphologies, although immature cores appear normal. Moreover, in immunofluorescent studies, both p12 and capsid proteins were lost rapidly from N-terminal p12 mutant viral cores after entry into target cells. Importantly, we determined that p12 binds directly to the MLV capsid lattice. However, we could not detect binding of an N-terminally altered p12 to capsid. Altogether, our data imply that p12 stabilises the mature MLV core, preventing premature loss of capsid, and that this is mediated by direct binding of p12 to the capsid shell. In this manner, p12 is also retained in the pre-integration complex where it facilitates tethering to mitotic chromosomes. These data also explain our previous observations that modifications to the N-terminus of p12 alter the ability of particles to abrogate restriction by TRIM5alpha and Fv1, factors that recognise viral capsid lattices.","['Wight, Darren J', 'Boucherit, Virginie C', 'Wanaguru, Madushi', 'Elis, Efrat', 'Hirst, Elizabeth M A', 'Li, Wilson', 'Ehrlich, Marcelo', 'Bacharach, Eran', 'Bishop, Kate N']","['Wight DJ', 'Boucherit VC', 'Wanaguru M', 'Elis E', 'Hirst EM', 'Li W', 'Ehrlich M', 'Bacharach E', 'Bishop KN']","['Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Cell Research and Immunology, George S.

We test here whether a 'corona-ion hypothesis' could explain these results. This hypothesis proposes that corona ions, atmospheric ions produced by power lines and blown away from them by the wind, increase the retention of airborne pollutants in the airways when breathed in and hence cause disease. We develop an improved model for calculating exposure to corona ions, using data on winds from meteorological stations and considering the whole length of power line within 600 m of each subject's address. Corona-ion exposure is highly correlated with proximity to power lines, and hence the results parallel the elevations in leukaemia risk seen with distance analyses. But our model explains the observed pattern of leukaemia rates around power lines less well than straightforward distance measurements, and ecological considerations also argue against the hypothesis. This does not disprove the corona-ion hypothesis as the explanation for our previous results, but nor does it provide support for it, or, by extension, any other hypothesis dependent on wind direction.","['Swanson, J', 'Bunch, K J', 'Vincent, T J', 'Murphy, M F G']","['Swanson J', 'Bunch KJ', 'Vincent TJ', 'Murphy MF']","['National Grid, 1-3 Strand, London WC2N 5EH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,['0 (Ions)'],IM,"['Body Burden', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Electricity', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ions', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Power Plants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', '*Wind']",2014/10/31 06:00,2015/08/14 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/34/4/873 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2014 Dec;34(4):873-89. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/34/4/873.

This study indirectly compares MR in patients taking nilotinib 300 mg bid with that in those taking dasatinib 100 mg qd by 12 months and through 48 months. METHODS: Patients in ENESTnd were re-weighted to match published baseline characteristics reported for DASISION using a propensity score model. After matching, differences in rates of major MR (MMR, measured as a 3 log reduction on the International Scale [IS]), MR(4.0) (4 log reduction on IS), and MR(4.5) (4.5 log reduction on IS) relative to imatinib were indirectly compared between nilotinib and dasatinib. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to indirectly compare MR outcomes between nilotinib and dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up, while rate differences were used to compare progression to AP/BC between nilotinib and dasatinib by 48 months. RESULTS: After matching, rates of MR by 12 months were higher with nilotinib vs dasatinib by 11.7% for MMR (p = 0.045), 8.2% for MR(4.0) (p = 0.029), and 8.5% for MR(4.5) (p < 0.001). Higher rates of MMR (HR = 1.44, p = 0.018) and MR(4.0) (HR = 1.58, p = 0.013) achievement were maintained with nilotinib compared to dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up. No statistically significant differences were observed for MR(4.5) through 48 months or progression to AP/BC by 48 months. LIMITATIONS: LIMITATIONS include comparisons based solely on indirect evidence and HRs for MR(4.0) and MR(4.5) from the DASISION trial being extracted from cumulative incidence curves. CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison suggests that nilotinib is associated with higher rates of achieving MMR, MR(4.0), and MR(4.5) by 12 months compared to dasatinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP. In addition, higher rates of MR achievement with nilotinib were also maintained through 48 months of follow-up.","['Signorovitch, James E', 'Betts, Keith A', 'Reichmann, William M', 'Thomason, Darren', 'Galebach, Phil', 'Wu, Eric Q', 'Chen, Lei', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J']","['Signorovitch JE', 'Betts KA', 'Reichmann WM', 'Thomason D', 'Galebach P', 'Wu EQ', 'Chen L', 'DeAngelo DJ']","['Analysis Group Inc. , Boston, MA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141107,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Propensity Score', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Thiazoles/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/10/31 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2014.977992 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2015 Feb;31(2):315-22. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.977992.

The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as primary treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has greatly changed expectations of both physicians and patients. The use of imatinib has led not only to reliable cytogenetic responses, but also to deeper ""molecular"" responses that have brought long-term survival to a disease that was generally lethal in patients who were not candidates for stem cell transplantation. The more recent entree of second-generation TKIs-nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib-as well as the protein synthesis inhibitor omacetaxine, has provided access to more potent agents. These new drugs provide a safety net for patients whose disease does not respond to imatinib, but also create dilemmas for physicians treating CML patients.

We found that BFA, at sub-microgram per milliliter concentrations, preferentially induced cell death in MDA-MB-231 suspension cultures (EC50: 0.016 microg/mL) compared to adhesion cultures. BFA also effectively inhibited clonogenic activity and the migration and matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) activity of MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blotting analysis indicated that the effects of BFA may be mediated by the down-regulation of breast CSC marker CD44 and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, as well as the reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, BFA also displayed selective cytotoxicity toward suspended MDA-MB-468 cells, and suppressed tumorsphere formation in T47D and MDA-MB-453 cells, suggesting that BFA may be effective against breast cancer cells of various phenotypes.","['Tseng, Chao-Neng', 'Hong, Yi-Ren', 'Chang, Hsueh-Wei', 'Yu, Tsai-Jung', 'Hung, Ting-Wei', 'Hou, Ming-Feng', 'Yuan, Shyng-Shiou F', 'Cho, Chung-Lung', 'Liu, Chien-Tsung', 'Chiu, Chien-Chih', 'Huang, Chih-Jen']","['Tseng CN', 'Hong YR', 'Chang HW', 'Yu TJ', 'Hung TW', 'Hou MF', 'Yuan SS', 'Cho CL', 'Liu CT', 'Chiu CC', 'Huang CJ']","['Department of Biomedical Science and Environmental Biology, Translational Research Center, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. clcho@faculty.nsysu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan. m835016@cc.kmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biomedical Science and Environmental Biology, Translational Research Center, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. changhw@kmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Natural Products, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. raynebox@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Natural Products, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. kva916@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Cancer Center and Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. mifeho@kmu.edu.tw.', 'Translational Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. 1020005@kmuh.org.tw.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan. clcho@faculty.nsysu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. u100022015@cc.kmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. cchiu@kmu.edu.tw.', 'Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. ccjjhh@kmu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141029,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mycotoxins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Brefeldin A/*pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Mycotoxins/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",2014/10/31 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules191117464 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules191117464 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2014 Oct 29;19(11):17464-77. doi: 10.3390/molecules191117464.,,,,PMC6271931,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further knowledge of arsenic binding to proteins will advance the development of bioanalytical techniques and therapeutic drugs. This review summarizes recent work on arsenic-based drugs, imaging of cellular events, capture and purification of arsenic-binding proteins, and biosensing of arsenic. Binding of arsenic to the promyelocytic leukemia fusion oncoprotein (PML-RARalpha) is a plausible mode of action leading to the successful treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Identification of other oncoproteins critical to other cancers and the development of various arsenicals and targeted delivery systems are promising approaches to the treatment of other types of cancers. Techniques for capture, purification, and identification of arsenic-binding proteins make use of specific binding between trivalent arsenicals and the thiols in proteins. Biarsenical probes, such as FlAsH-EDT2 and ReAsH-EDT2, coupled with tetracysteine tags that are genetically incorporated into the target proteins, are used for site-specific fluorescence labelling and imaging of the target proteins in living cells. These allow protein dynamics and protein-protein interactions to be studied. Arsenic affinity chromatography is useful for purification of thiol-containing proteins, and its combination with mass spectrometry provides a targeted proteomic approach for studying the interactions between arsenicals and proteins in cells. Arsenic biosensors evolved from the knowledge of arsenic resistance and arsenic binding to proteins in bacteria, and have now been developed into analytical techniques that are suitable for the detection of arsenic in the field. Examples in the four areas, arsenic-based drugs, imaging of cellular events, purification of specific proteins, and arsenic biosensors, demonstrate important therapeutic and analytical applications of arsenic protein binding.","['Chen, Beibei', 'Liu, Qingqing', 'Popowich, Aleksandra', 'Shen, Shengwen', 'Yan, Xiaowen', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Li, Xing-Fang', 'Weinfeld, Michael', 'Cullen, William R', 'Le, X Chris']","['Chen B', 'Liu Q', 'Popowich A', 'Shen S', 'Yan X', 'Zhang Q', 'Li XF', 'Weinfeld M', 'Cullen WR', 'Le XC']","['Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. xc.le@ualberta.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141030,England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Arsenic/chemistry/metabolism', '*Arsenicals/chemistry/metabolism', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', '*Protein Binding', 'Proteomics/*methods', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']",2014/10/31 06:00,2016/02/11 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4mt00222a [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2015 Jan;7(1):39-55. doi: 10.1039/c4mt00222a.

Elevated ferritin level pre-HSCT has been used as a marker for iron overload. It is unclear whether the negative effect of iron overload as measured by elevated ferritin level extends beyond the first three months post HSCT, as this would suggest a potential role for active management of iron overload post HSCT. PATIENTS: Sixty-three patients with AML and MDS who underwent an allogeneic HSCT from a sibling or unrelated donor between January to December 2006, had a pre-HSCT ferritin level and were alive and disease free 90 days post HSCT. RESULTS: Median age was 51. Patients with the lowest pre-HSCT ferritin level (Q1) had a trend towards improved overall survival and progression free survival when compared to patients with higher level (Q2-Q4) (P=0.06, and 0.125). Cumulative incidence of NRM at 2 years was 20 and 30% respectively (P=0.4). CONCLUSION: Pre-HSCT ferritin level may still have an impact on HSCT events beyond 3 months post transplant, suggesting a role for research into active management of iron overload with either phlebotomy or chelation.","['Efebera, Yvonne A', 'Thandi, Rupinderjit S', 'Saliba, Rima M', 'Popat, Uday', 'De Lima, Marcos', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Giralt, Sergio']","['Efebera YA', 'Thandi RS', 'Saliba RM', 'Popat U', 'De Lima M', 'Alousi A', 'Hosing C', 'Rondon G', 'Champlin R', 'Giralt S']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Internet J Hematol,The Internet journal of hematology,101279474,,,,2009/01/01 00:00,2009/01/01 00:01,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Internet J Hematol. 2009;7(1).,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Ferritin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant', 'Late Transplant Outcome', 'MDS']",['K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4209589,['NIHMS385293'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This led to the findings of previously identified infections by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). In addition, we also found a previously unreported infection of one cell line (DEL) with a murine leukemia virus. High expression of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) transcripts was observed in DEL cells, and we identified four transcriptionally active integration sites, one being in the TNFRSF6B gene. We also found low levels of MuLV reads in a number of other cell lines and provided evidence suggesting cross-contamination during sequencing. Analysis of HTLV-1 integrations in two cell lines, HuT 102 and MJ, identified 14 and 66 transcriptionally active integration sites with potentially activating integrations in immune regulatory genes, including interleukin-15 (IL-15), IL-6ST, STAT5B, HIVEP1, and IL-9R. Although KSHV and EBV do not typically integrate into the genome, we investigated a previously identified integration of EBV into the BACH2 locus in Raji cells. This analysis identified a BACH2 disruption mechanism involving splice donor sequestration. Through viral gene expression analysis, we detected expression of stable intronic RNAs from the EBV BamHI W repeats that may be part of long transcripts spanning the repeat region. We also observed transcripts at the EBV vIL-10 locus exclusively in the Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line, Hs 611.T, the expression of which were uncoupled from other lytic genes. Assessment of the KSHV viral transcriptome in BCP-1 cells showed expression of the viral immune regulators, K2/vIL-6, K4/vIL-8-like vCCL1, and K5/E2-ubiquitin ligase 1 that was significantly higher than expression of the latency-associated nuclear antigen. Together, this investigation sheds light into the virus composition across these lymphoma model systems and provides insights into common viral mechanistic principles. IMPORTANCE: Viruses cause cancer in humans. In lymphomas the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 are major contributors to oncogenesis. We assessed virus-host interactions using a high throughput sequencing method that facilitates the discovery of new virus-host associations and the investigation into how the viruses alter their host environment. We found a previously unknown murine leukemia virus infection in one cell line. We identified cellular genes, including cytokine regulators, that are disrupted by virus integration, and we determined mechanisms through which virus integration causes deregulation of cellular gene expression. Investigation into the KSHV transcriptome in the BCP-1 cell line revealed high-level expression of immune signaling genes. EBV transcriptome analysis showed expression of vIL-10 transcripts in a Hodgkin's lymphoma that was uncoupled from lytic genes. These findings illustrate unique mechanisms of viral gene regulation and to the importance of virus-mediated host immune signaling in lymphomas.","['Cao, Subing', 'Strong, Michael J', 'Wang, Xia', 'Moss, Walter N', 'Concha, Monica', 'Lin, Zhen', ""O'Grady, Tina"", 'Baddoo, Melody', 'Fewell, Claire', 'Renne, Rolf', 'Flemington, Erik K']","['Cao S', 'Strong MJ', 'Wang X', 'Moss WN', 'Concha M', 'Lin Z', ""O'Grady T"", 'Baddoo M', 'Fewell C', 'Renne R', 'Flemington EK']","['Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics Microbiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Tulane Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA eflemin@tulane.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141029,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Herpesviridae/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Virus Integration']",2014/10/31 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02570-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02570-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Jan;89(1):713-29. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02570-14.

It is the most common leukemia in Western countries and typically occurs in elderly patients. Initial treatment of CLL often includes a first-generation anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) with chemotherapy and is the current standard of treatment for ""younger"" old adults (< 70 yrs of age) or older, clinically fit patients. However, because disease progression and drug resistance are inevitable, patients typically die from their disease or treatment-related complications. Improved understanding of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, which is essential for normal B-cell growth and tumorigenesis, has led to the development of targeted therapies, with improved short-term clinical outcomes. Ibrutinib, obinutuzumab, and idelalisib, three novel agents recently approved by the U.S. Food and Administration for CLL, all have the potential to change the treatment paradigm. In this article, we describe the pathogenesis of CLL and some of its prognostic factors. Emphasis is on the pharmacology, dosing, clinical efficacy, safety, and place of therapy of ibrutinib, obinutuzumab, and idelalisib. Investigational agents that target different parts of the CLL pathogenic pathway are also described.","['Chung, Clement', 'Lee, Rosetta']","['Chung C', 'Lee R']","['Lyndon B.

However, few effective CTL epitopes have been identified to date yet. We previously reported that MLAA-22, a protein composed of 631 amino acid residues, is a novel acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated antigen. In the present study, ten high-score 9-mer peptides, which were selected from MLAA-22 by using ProPred1 and SYFPEITHI bioinformatics tools, were screened to identify HLA-A*0201-restricted-specific CTL epitopes. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells were generated in vitro to be used as antigen-presenting cells for the induction of CTLs. We found that peptide MLAA-22(379-387) (LLPNAIYKV) exhibited the highest binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 among all peptide candidates in the peptide-T2 binding assay. The percentage of positive T2 cells treated with MLAA-22(379-387) was about 96.3%, which is even higher than that of the positive control peptide CML28(173-181) (95.1%). MLAA-22(379-387)-induced CTLs showed the most significant cytotoxic activity and apparent killing effects on the cell lines including THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia), A549, T2, U937, and MCF-7, and the specific lysis ratios were 83.8, 32.6, 64.4, 64.4, and 32.6%, respectively, when the effector to target ratio (E/T) was 20:1. Specific lysis (%) of MLAA1 was significantly increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, respectively) in THP-1 cell than those in other cancer cell lines and were 28.5, 67.8, and 83.8% at ratio 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1, respectively. Hence, MLAA-22(379-387) is a potential tumor-associated antigen target for AML immunotherapy.","['Li, Jing', 'Bai, Ju', 'Gu, Liufang', 'He, Aili', 'Wang, Jin', 'Wang, Jianli', 'Zhang, Pengyu', 'Zhang, Wanggang']","['Li J', 'Bai J', 'Gu L', 'He A', 'Wang J', 'Wang J', 'Zhang P', 'Zhang W']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004, Shaanxi Province, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology/*metabolism', 'Forecasting', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2014/10/31 06:00,2015/06/25 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0293-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Dec;31(12):293. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0293-0.

Dietary intake in terms of macronutrients, micronutrients, food variety and diet diversity score changed significantly after the induction chemotherapy. No significant relationship was found between the changes in dietary indices and nutritional status. Chemotherapy-related side effects as an additional factor to cancer itself could affect dietary intake of leukaemia patients. The effectiveness of an early assessment of nutritional status and dietary intake should be further investigated in order to deter further deterioration.","['Malihi, Z', 'Kandiah, M', 'Chan, Y M', 'Esfandbod, M', 'Vakili, M', 'Hosseinzadeh, M', 'Zarif Yeganeh, M']","['Malihi Z', 'Kandiah M', 'Chan YM', 'Esfandbod M', 'Vakili M', 'Hosseinzadeh M', 'Zarif Yeganeh M']","['Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Faculty of Applied Sciences, UCSI University, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Institute of Gerontology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Emergency Medicine Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Rasoul Akram Hospital, Oncopathology Research Center, Iran University for Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', ""Imam Reza Hospital, Medical University for the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army, Tehran, Iran."", 'Rasoul Akram Hospital, Iran University for Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141030,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,"['0 (Dietary Carbohydrates)', '0 (Dietary Proteins)', '0 (Micronutrients)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', '*Diet', 'Dietary Carbohydrates/administration & dosage', 'Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Intake/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Meals', 'Micronutrients/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutritional Status/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/31 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ecc.12262 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2015 Jul;24(4):542-52. doi: 10.1111/ecc.12262.

In light of these risks, antifungal prophylaxis has always been debated. We conducted a single-center retrospective study of two prophylactic antifungal agents (fluconazole/posaconazole) in 91 consecutive patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML between 2005 and 2009, in order to evaluate the impact on the incidence of IFI and on the mycological flora of the patients. METHODS: In total, 39 patients received prophylactic fluconazole versus 52 who received posaconazole. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. RESULTS: Overall, 17 patients developed an IFI, with no difference in frequency between the two groups. Utilization of empirical or pre-emptive therapy was similar irrespective of the type of prophylaxis used. Mycological examination of stools revealed an increase in non-albicans Candida colonization in the fluconazole group during hospitalization and the appearance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae colonization in patients receiving posaconazole. CONCLUSION: The present study does not distinguish between fluconazole and posaconazole as a primary effective prevention against fungal infections.

To extend the spectrum of known somatic variants in ALL, we performed whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of three B-cell precursor patients, of which one carried the t(12;21)ETV6-RUNX1 translocation and two lacked a known primary genetic aberration, and one T-ALL patient. We found that each patient had a unique genome, with a combination of well-known and previously undetected genomic aberrations. By targeted sequencing in 168 patients, we identified KMT2D and KIF1B as novel putative driver genes. We also identified a putative regulatory non-coding variant that coincided with overexpression of the growth factor MDK. Our results contribute to an increased understanding of the biological mechanisms that lead to ALL and suggest that regulatory variants may be more important for cancer development than recognized to date.

Since mutations hit different domains of the receptor, they are predicted to heterogeneously perturb ligand-induced NOTCH1 activity. Moreover, T-ALL cells also co-express NOTCH3 receptors which could be triggered by different ligands. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of DLL4 in the regulation of NOTCH signaling in T-ALL cells in the context of different types of NOTCH1 mutation or wild-type NOTCH receptor, as well as the effects of DLL4 neutralization on T-ALL engraftment in mice. We found that NOTCH signaling can be stimulated in T-ALL cells in vitro by either human or murine DLL4 with heterogeneous effects, according to NOTCH1/FBW7 mutation status, and that these effects can be blocked by antibodies neutralizing DLL4, NOTCH1 or NOTCH2/3. In vivo, DLL4 is expressed in the spleen and the bone marrow (BM) of NOD/SCID mice bearing T-ALL xenografts as well as the BM of T-ALL patients. Importantly, DLL4 blockade impaired growth of T-ALL cells in NOD/SCID mice and increased leukemia cell apoptosis. These results show that DLL4 is an important component of the tumor microenvironment which contributes to the early steps of T-ALL cell growth.","['Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Agnusdei, Valentina', 'Pusceddu, Irene', 'Pinazza, Marica', 'Moserle, Lidia', 'Masiero, Massimo', 'Rossi, Elisabetta', 'Crescenzi, Marika', 'Hoey, Timothy', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Indraccolo, Stefano']","['Minuzzo S', 'Agnusdei V', 'Pusceddu I', 'Pinazza M', 'Moserle L', 'Masiero M', 'Rossi E', 'Crescenzi M', 'Hoey T', 'Ponzoni M', 'Amadori A', 'Indraccolo S']","['Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, 35100 Padova, Italy.', 'Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, 35100 Padova, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, 35100 Padova, Italy, Present addresses: Klinische Chemie und Laboratoriumsmedizin, Universitatsklinikum des Saarlandes, Homburg/Saar, Germany.', 'Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, 35100 Padova, Italy.', ""Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, 35100 Padova, Italy, Tumor Angiogenesis Group, Catalan Institute of Oncology-IDIBELL, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, 35100 Padova, Italy, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK and.', 'Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, 35100 Padova, Italy.', 'Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, 35100 Padova, Italy, Gastroenterology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc., Redwood City, 94002 CA, USA and.', 'Pathology Unit and Leukemia Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20100 Milan, Italy.', 'Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, 35100 Padova, Italy, Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, 35100 Padova, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, 35100 Padova, Italy, stefano.indraccolo@unipd.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141029,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DLL4 protein, human)', '0 (DLL4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/10/31 06:00,2015/03/18 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bgu223 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgu223 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2015 Jan;36(1):115-21. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgu223.

Moreover, it has also been associated to the multiple drug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Our first results pointed out a straight relation between OCT4 and ABC transporters in K562-derivative MDR (Lucena) cells. Sequencing of ABC promoters did not reveal any mutation that could explain the differential expression of OCT4 in Lucena cells. Furthermore, sequencing of the homeobox domain region from the OCT4 gene isolated from both cell lines evinced, for the first time, that this transcription factor is a target of mutations and might be related to the MDR phenotype. The encountered mutations implied in several amino acids substitutions in both cell lines. K562 had seven amino acids substituted (three of them exclusive), while Lucena had 13 substitutions (nine of them exclusive). In addition, an in silico search for phosphorylation motifs within the amino acid stretch compared showed that human normal OCT4 has seven potential phosphorylation motifs. However, K562 has lost one phosphorylation motif and Lucena two of them. These findings bring OCT4 as an important target for cancer treatment, especially those resistant to chemotherapy.","['Oliveira, Bruno Rodrigues', 'Figueiredo, Marcio Azevedo', 'Trindade, Gilma Santos', 'Marins, Luis Fernando']","['Oliveira BR', 'Figueiredo MA', 'Trindade GS', 'Marins LF']","['Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas (ICB), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande.

The rationale for this Federal Government Council is to financially support the treatment of all children registered into this system. All patients are within a network of 55 public certified hospitals nationwide. METHODS: In the current study, data from 2007 to 2012 are presented for all patients (0-18 years) with a pathological diagnosis of leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors. The parameters analyzed were prevalence, incidence, mortality, and abandonment rate. RESULTS: A diagnosis of cancer was documented in 14,178 children. The incidence was of 156.9/million/year (2012). The median age was 4.9. The most common childhood cancer is leukemia, which occurs in 49.8% of patients (2007-2012); and has an incidence rate of 78.1/million/year (2012). The national mortality rate was 5.3/100,000 in 2012, however in the group between 15 to 18 years it reaches a level of 8.6. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that there is a high incidence of childhood cancer in Mexico. In particular, the results reveal an elevated incidence and prevalence of leukemia especially from 0 to 4 years. Only 4.7% of these patients abandoned treatment. The clinical outcome for all of the children studied improved since the establishment of this national program.","['Rivera-Luna, Roberto', 'Shalkow-Klincovstein, Jaime', 'Velasco-Hidalgo, Liliana', 'Cardenas-Cardos, Rocio', 'Zapata-Tarres, Marta', 'Olaya-Vargas, Alberto', 'Aguilar-Ortiz, Marco R', 'Altamirano-Alvarez, Eduardo', 'Correa-Gonzalez, Cecilia', 'Sanchez-Zubieta, Fernando', 'Pantoja-Guillen, Francisco']","['Rivera-Luna R', 'Shalkow-Klincovstein J', 'Velasco-Hidalgo L', 'Cardenas-Cardos R', 'Zapata-Tarres M', 'Olaya-Vargas A', 'Aguilar-Ortiz MR', 'Altamirano-Alvarez E', 'Correa-Gonzalez C', 'Sanchez-Zubieta F', 'Pantoja-Guillen F']","['Head of the Division of Pediatric Hem/Oncology, National Institute of Pediatrics (NIP), Coordinator for the Technical Committee of the National Council for the Prevention and Treatment of Childhood Cancer, Mexico City, Mexico. riveraluna@terra.com.mx.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141029,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Insurance, Health', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prevalence', '*Public Health Surveillance', 'Registries']",2014/10/31 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-790 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-790 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Oct 29;14:790. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-790.,,,,PMC4228174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the lack of unique surface markers expressed by neoplastic monocytes and the frequent CD34-negative blast immunophenotype, the diagnostic value of flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) in CMML is rarely studied. In this study, by using a multicolor FCI assay, we assessed bone marrow (BM) immunophenotypical alterations in 118 CMML patients and follow-up BM samples in 35 of these patients. The median BM monocytes as determined by FCI were 14% (1-63%), correlated with morphologic count (P = 0.0004). FCI alterations in monocytes were observed in 96% and granulocytes in 83% of cases. The percentage of CD34(+) myeloblasts by FCI was low [median 0.6% (0.02-12.6%)], but exhibiting frequent aberrancies [median 6 (2-12)]. CD34(+) B-cell precursors were absent in 93% of cases. In 35 patients with follow-up BM samples assessed, the CD34(+) myeloblasts showed persistent FCI aberrancies in all 29 patients treated with hypomethylating agents and 3 patients on observation, but became normal in 3 patients following stem cell transplant. In conclusion, CMML exhibit numerous FCI alterations in monocytes, granulocytes, and more profound/frequent in CD34(+) myeloblasts. These findings provide solid evidence for using FCI as an ancillary test in CMML diagnosis and also, in assessment of treatment responses.","['Shen, Qi', 'Ouyang, Juan', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Routbort, Mark', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Shen Q', 'Ouyang J', 'Tang G', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Routbort M', 'Konoplev S', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150417,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/31 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12477 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Aug;95(2):168-76. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12477.

Current first-line treatments include all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), anthracyclines, and other conventional chemotherapies (CTs). Although APL is generally associated with a good prognosis, about 20% of patients who achieve remission subsequently relapse and are resistant to the previously administrated treatment. The objective of this study was to assess, from a Canadian perspective, the economic impact of arsenic trioxide (ATO) compared to ATRA+CT for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory APL. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of ATO compared to ATRA+CT for treating patients with relapsed/refractory APL was assessed over a lifetime horizon using a Markov model. The model considers five health states: induction, second remission, treatment failure or relapse, postfailure, and death. Markov cycle length was 1 month for the first 24 months and 1 yr thereafter. The model also takes into account the incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events reported in clinical trials. Analyses were conducted from a Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and a societal perspective. RESULTS: Compared to ATRA+CT, ATO was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $ 20,551/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from a MoH perspective and $ 22,219/QALY from a societal perspective. Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that ATO is a cost-effective strategy in 99.27% and 98.98% of the simulations from a MoH and a societal perspective, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation demonstrates that ATO is a cost-effective strategy compared to ATRA+CT for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory APL in Canada.","['Lachaine, Jean', 'Mathurin, Karine', 'Barakat, Stephane', 'Couban, Stephen']","['Lachaine J', 'Mathurin K', 'Barakat S', 'Couban S']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Market Access and Health Outcomes, Lundbeck Canada Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150204,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Canada/epidemiology', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2014/10/31 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12475 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Sep;95(3):218-29. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12475.

To design a tumor-specific retroviral replicating vector (RRV), we replaced the U3 region of the RRV ACE-GFP with a regulatory sequence consisting of the hepatitis B virus enhancer II (EII) and human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) core promoter to produce ACE-GFP-EIIAFP, a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-targeting RRV. Similar to ACE-GFP, ACE-GFP-EIIAFP exhibited robust green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in HCC cells and, most importantly, it exhibited HCC-specific replication and did not replicate in non-HCC tumor cells or normal liver cells. We sequenced the promoter region of ACE-GFP-EIIAFP collected from serial infection cycles to examine the genomic stability of the vector during its replicative spread, and found that the vector could retain the hybrid promoter in the genome for at least six infection cycles. In vitro studies revealed that ACE-CD-EIIAFP and ACE-PNP-EIIAFP, which express the yeast cytosine deaminase and Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase, respectively, exert a highly potent cytotoxic effect on HCC cells in the presence of their respective prodrugs. In vivo, ACE-CD-EIIAFP-mediated suicide gene therapy efficiently suppressed HCC tumor growth and no detectable RRV signal was observed in extratumoral tissues. These results suggest that the tumor-specific, suicide-gene-encoding RRV may fulfill the promise of retroviral gene therapy for cancer.","['Lai, Y-H', 'Lin, C-C', 'Chen, S-H', 'Tai, C-K']","['Lai YH', 'Lin CC', 'Chen SH', 'Tai CK']","['Department of Life Science and Institutes of Molecular Biology and Biomedical Science, National Chung Cheng University, Min-Hsiung, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science and Institutes of Molecular Biology and Biomedical Science, National Chung Cheng University, Min-Hsiung, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science and Institutes of Molecular Biology and Biomedical Science, National Chung Cheng University, Min-Hsiung, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science and Institutes of Molecular Biology and Biomedical Science, National Chung Cheng University, Min-Hsiung, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*therapy', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genomic Instability', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*therapy', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/genetics/metabolism']",2014/10/31 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2014/10/31 06:00'],"['2014/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['gt201498 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2014.98 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2015 Feb;22(2):155-62. doi: 10.1038/gt.2014.98.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effect of QH on prostate cancer cells. The results demonstrated that QH decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased antioxidant capacity in PC3 cells at various concentrations (2.560 microg/ml) with peak inhibition and augmentation changes of 3.22 and 3.00fold, respectively. Following treatment with QH for 48 and 72 h, the IC50-values on PC3 cells were 19.7 and 12.4 microg/ml, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed that QH induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells via activation of caspase3 and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase. In addition, QH significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of PC3 cells as well as reduced the expression of numerous prostate tumorassociated microRNAs (miRs), including miR21, compared to that of untreated human prostate cancer cells. QH was also found to enhance the expression of tumor suppressor programmed cell death protein 4, which was negatively regulated by miR21. Furthermore, induced overexpression of miR21 using premiR21 oligonucleotides attenuated the beneficial effect of QH on prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that QH exerted an anticancer effect on human prostate cancer cells, the mechanism of which proceeded, at least in part, via the inhibition of the miR21 signaling pathway.","['Yang, Feng-Qiang', 'Liu, Min', 'Li, Wei', 'Che, Jian-Ping', 'Wang, Guang-Chun', 'Zheng, Jun-Hua']","['Yang FQ', 'Liu M', 'Li W', 'Che JP', 'Wang GC', 'Zheng JH']","[""Department of Urology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, P.R.

Related molecular mechanism may be the direct effect of IFN-alpha on CML stem cells. Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) are important to protect CML stem cells, and IFN-alpha was described as a potential inhibitor of hMSCs. However, the exact mechanism remains obscure. PML as a known tumor suppressor locates downstream of the IFN-alpha pathway, and little is known about the PML gene regulation in hMSCs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IFN-alpha on hMSCs and defined the role of PML involved in this process. Our results suggested that hMSCs incurred senescence upon IFN-alpha stimulation, while PML levels were observed significant increased. The recombinant lentiviral vector, which encodes shRNA against PML or full-length PML cDNA, was constructed. By knocking-down and overexpressing PML, we found that PML was indispensable to IFN-alpha mediated hMSC senescence. The molecular mechanism underlying this process may be an increased co-localization of PML and p53 induced by IFN-alpha. Our data demonstrated that IFN-alpha can induce cellular senescence of hMSCs and PML plays a key role in this process. These findings provided novel insight into the effect of IFN-alpha on hMSCs.","['Fu, Shan', 'Wei, Jieping', 'Wang, Gang', 'Wang, Binsheng', 'Wang, Yebo', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Huang, He']","['Fu S', 'Wei J', 'Wang G', 'Wang B', 'Wang Y', 'Lai X', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, P.R.

However, in Mexico and other developing countries with large populations of children, little is known regarding the need for palliative care services. We aimed to assess the need for palliative and end-of-life care for children dying in public hospitals affiliated with Secretaria de Salud in Mexico. MEASUREMENT: We conducted a retrospective review of deaths of children (1-17 years old) occurring during 2011 and determined deaths associated with underlying complex chronic conditions by reviewing the four causes of death listed in the death certificate. We collected sociodemographic and clinical data and utilized univariate and multivariate analyses to determine factors associated with complex chronic conditions. RESULTS: A total of 2715 pediatric deaths were studied. We found 41% were associated with a complex chronic condition. The most frequent types of conditions were malignancies (47%), neuromuscular (18%), cardiovascular (12%), and renal (10%). Children with renal and malignant conditions died at an older age than children with other types of complex chronic conditions. Multivariate analysis indicated the independent predictors of death with complex chronic condition were no indigenous ethnicity, lack of admission to the intensive care unit during the final hospital stay, and having affiliation with an institution for health care. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of pediatric deaths are associated with complex chronic conditions indicating the provision of adequate funding for professional education and palliative care initiatives for children in Mexico, should be a topic of the national health care agenda.","['Cardenas-Turanzas, Marylou', 'Tovalin-Ahumada, Horacio', 'Romo, Carlos Guillermo', 'Okhuysen-Cawley, Regina']","['Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Tovalin-Ahumada H', 'Romo CG', 'Okhuysen-Cawley R']","['1 Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141029,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child Mortality', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease/*mortality', 'Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Needs Assessment/*statistics & numerical data', 'Palliative Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Terminal Care/*statistics & numerical data']",2014/10/30 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/30 06:00'],"['2014/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jpm.2014.0129 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2015 Feb;18(2):162-6. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2014.0129.

The growing use of antifungals in prophylaxis and treatment influences which species will cause an IFD as well as the resistance patterns of these fungi. On the one hand, antifungal prophylaxis has mitigated, but not eliminated, the threat of candidiasis. Furthermore, prophylaxis trials have shown trends of reduced aspergillosis in BMT patients; however, no survival benefits were seen, and 1 trial indicated a lower rate of aspergillosis and survival benefits in patients with AML. Future prophylaxis trials should reduce the heterogeneity of risk in study participants in order to better assess benefit; these trials should also incorporate fungal biomarkers into their design.

The variant GLI1 protein exhibited reduced transactivation function in vivo, decreasing the ability of activating hedgehog signal, which has been proposed as an unfavorable prognostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The GLI1 Q1100E (NCBI SNP ID: rs2228226) genotypes in 155 CLL patients were detected by direct sequencing. The difference between frequencies of GLI1 Q1100E genotype among CLL patients and controls was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that in comparison with G/G, GLI1 SNP1100 C/C genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CLL (OR 3.787, 95% CI 1.814-7.907, p < 0.001). Compared with the SNP1100 C/G genotype, C/C genotype significantly increased the risk of CLL (OR 3.860, 95% CI 1.827-8.153, p < 0.001). In addition, combining C/G with G/G, C/C genotype also significantly increased the risk of CLL (OR 3.820, 95% CI 1.885-7.742, p < 0.001). The comparison between frequencies of C and G allele of GLI1 was also statistically significant (p = 0.004). In the entire cohort, SNP1100 genotypes were found in association with Binet stage (p = 0.045) and trisomy 12 (p = 0.036). By comparing C/C with G allele (C/G+G/G) genotype, there was a significant correlation with trisomy 12 (p = 0.013). This study demonstrated that GLI1 Q1100E polymorphism was closely associated with CLL. C/C genotype contributes to the risk of developing CLL and correlates with trisomy 12.

In each case, lymphocytes were the predominant cell type and had atypical cytologic features that closely resembled those of malignant lymphoblasts, including larger size, irregular nuclear contours, immature chromatin, presence of nucleoli, and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios. Flow cytometry (FC) was performed in two cases and revealed a predominant T-cell population with normal expression of T-lineage antigens and no expression of CD34, CD10, or CD1a or coexpression of CD4 and CD8. In summary, chylothorax in neonates and infants are comprised of cytologically immature lymphoid cells.

Recently, with the development of gene signatures which integrate rather than replace the clinical predictors in the prediction rule, the focus has been moved to the validation of the added predictive value of a gene signature, i.e. to the verification that the inclusion of the new gene signature in a prediction model is able to improve its prediction ability. METHODS: The high-dimensional nature of the data from which a new signature is derived raises challenging issues and necessitates the modification of classical methods to adapt them to this framework. Here we show how to validate the added predictive value of a signature derived from high-dimensional data and critically discuss the impact of the choice of methods on the results. RESULTS: The analysis of the added predictive value of two gene signatures developed in two recent studies on the survival of leukemia patients allows us to illustrate and empirically compare different validation techniques in the high-dimensional framework. CONCLUSIONS: The issues related to the high-dimensional nature of the omics predictors space affect the validation process. An analysis procedure based on repeated cross-validation is suggested.","['De Bin, Riccardo', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Boulesteix, Anne-Laure']","['De Bin R', 'Herold T', 'Boulesteix AL']","['Department of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Marchioninistr, 15, 81377 Munchen, Germany. debin@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141028,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Rate', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Validation Studies as Topic', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2014/10/30 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2014/10/30 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2288-14-117 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-14-117 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2014 Oct 28;14:117. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-14-117.,,,,PMC4271356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maitake mushroom beta-glucan, a dietary supplement, stimulates hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production, and recovery of peripheral blood leukocytes after bone marrow injury. This phase II trial examined the effects of Maitake on innate immune function in MDS. METHODS: Myelodysplastic syndromes patients with International Prognostic Scoring System Low- and Intermediate-1-risk disease received oral Maitake extract at 3 mg/kg twice daily for 12 weeks. Primary endpoints included neutrophil count and function tested as endogenous or stimulated neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC). ROS activators were Escherichia coli, phorbol ester, and the bacterial peptide N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Complete blood counts, chemistry panels, iron studies, and monocyte function were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 21 patients enrolled, 18 completed the study and were evaluable. Maitake increased endogenous (basal) neutrophil (p = 0.005) and monocyte function (p = 0.021). Pre-treatment monocyte response to E. coli was reduced in MDS patients compared with HC (p = 0.002) and increased (p = 0.0004) after treatment. fMLP-stimulated ROS production response also increased (p = 0.03). Asymptomatic eosinophilia occurred in 4 patients (p = 0.014). Other changes in albumin, hemoglobin, and total protein were not clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Maitake was well tolerated. Enhanced in vitro neutrophil and monocyte function following treatment demonstrate that Maitake has beneficial immunomodulatory potential in MDS. Further study is warranted.","['Wesa, Kathleen M', 'Cunningham-Rundles, Susanna', 'Klimek, Virginia M', 'Vertosick, Emily', 'Coleton, Marci I', 'Yeung, K Simon', 'Lin, Hong', 'Nimer, Stephen', 'Cassileth, Barrie R']","['Wesa KM', 'Cunningham-Rundles S', 'Klimek VM', 'Vertosick E', 'Coleton MI', 'Yeung KS', 'Lin H', 'Nimer S', 'Cassileth BR']","['Integrative Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1429 First Avenue, New York, NY, 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141029,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Complex Mixtures)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Complex Mixtures/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Grifola/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Neutrophils/immunology/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/10/30 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2014/10/30 06:00'],"['2014/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-014-1628-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2015 Feb;64(2):237-47. doi: 10.1007/s00262-014-1628-6.

Notch receptor signaling in this microenvironment is a critical regulator of HSC fate and differentiation. Notch signaling also has the potential to modulate the growth of various malignant cell types, as evidenced by the growing list of hematologic cancers and other malignancies associated with either mutations in Notch genes or alterations in Notch signaling. In both health and disease, activation of Notch signaling predominantly exerts influence through stromal cell interactions with the tumor or stem cell microenvironments. Definitive evidence from transgenic mouse models has shown that alterations in stromal cell signaling from the bone marrow niche can induce malignant outgrowth of preleukemic clones and leukemia. Understanding how Notch receptor signals in the bone marrow microenvironment govern stem cell behavior will advance our understanding of cancer pathogenesis in hematologic malignancies and may have implications for treating metastatic solid tumors involving bone.

Since then, DEK has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in a variety of cancer cell types through its roles in inhibiting cell differentiation, senescence and apoptosis. Certain studies have established that DEK is dysregulated in several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its clinical significance in human HCC remains unknown. In this study, the expression of DEK mRNA and protein was examined in 55 surgical HCC specimens and matched nontumorous tissues. In addition, the correlation between DEK expression and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis was analyzed. mRNA and protein levels of DEK were found to be significantly overexpressed in the majority of HCC tumors when compared with matched normal hepatic tissues (P<0.05). In addition, the expression pattern of DEK was closely correlated with differentiation status, portal venous invasion and tumor size (P<0.05). KaplanMeier curves demonstrated that patients with higher DEK expression levels had significantly poorer survival than those with lower DEK expression levels (P=0.003). In addition, Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the level of DEK expression may be a valuable prognostic factor (P<0.05). These results suggested that DEK may play a significant role in hepatocyte differentiation and may serve as a useful prognostic marker and biomarker for the staging of HCC.","['Yi, Huo-Chun', 'Liu, Ya-Li', 'You, Pan', 'Pan, Jin-Shui', 'Zhou, Jian-Yan', 'Liu, Zhen-Jin', 'Zhang, Zhong-Ying']","['Yi HC', 'Liu YL', 'You P', 'Pan JS', 'Zhou JY', 'Liu ZJ', 'Zhang ZY']","['Center of Clinical Laboratory, Zhongshan Hospital, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361004, P.R.

METHODS: The nearest-aged siblings (8-17 years) of minor CLS participating in the French LEA cohort (Childhood and Adolescent Leukemia), at the Marseilles center, were included. Siblings' QoL was self-reported using the 'Vecu et Sante Percue de l'Adolescent et l'enfant' questionnaire. Results were compared with those obtained for age-matched and sex-matched French controls subjects. Characteristics likely to be associated with siblings' QoL (sibling's and survivor's sociodemographic and health-related and cancer-related characteristics) were explored through multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-one siblings participated (mean age 12.7 +/- 2.8 years, mean follow-up duration from diagnosis to evaluation 8.8 +/- 2.5 years). They reported a significantly higher perception of QoL compared with the general population regarding psychological domains, while reporting a lower perception regarding social domains. In multivariate analysis, older age at diagnosis for both siblings and survivors was risk factor for impaired psychological QoL. An elevated leukemia burden index was linked with lower scores in self-esteem dimension, whereas having at least one sequelae for the survivor was linked with better scores in psychological well-being dimension. Low or middle affluence and older sibling's age at diagnosis were risk factors for impaired social QoL. Maximal R(2) was 30%. CONCLUSIONS: Minor siblings of CLS reported a relatively good QoL, particularly in psychological domains. Given the low proportion of QoL variability explained, other contributing factors (e.g., family functioning) must be explored.","['Berbis, Julie', 'Oudin, Claire', 'Alessandrini, Marine', 'Vercasson, Camille', 'Barlogis, Vincent', 'Chambost, Herve', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Auquier, Pascal']","['Berbis J', 'Oudin C', 'Alessandrini M', 'Vercasson C', 'Barlogis V', 'Chambost H', 'Michel G', 'Auquier P']","['Aix-Marseilles Univ, EA 3279 - Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, 13005, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, APHM, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, EA 3279 - Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, 13005, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, EA 3279 - Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, 13005, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, EA 3279 - Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, 13005, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, APHM, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, APHM, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, EA 3279 - Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, 13005, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, APHM, Marseilles, France.', 'Aix-Marseilles Univ, EA 3279 - Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, 13005, Marseilles, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141028,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Family Relations', 'Female', 'Friends', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Leisure Activities', '*Leukemia', 'Male', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', '*Self Concept', 'Siblings/*psychology', '*Survivors']",2014/10/29 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3709 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2015 Jun;24(6):661-8. doi: 10.1002/pon.3709.

With the advances in high-throughput techniques, a large number of protein-protein interactions are available, which make it possible to identify disease-related genes at the network level. However, network-based identification of disease-related genes is still a challenge as the considerable false-positives are still existed in the current available protein interaction networks (PIN). RESULTS: Considering the fact that the majority of genetic disorders tend to manifest only in a single or a few tissues, we constructed tissue-specific networks (TSN) by integrating PIN and tissue-specific data. We further weighed the constructed tissue-specific network (WTSN) by using DNA methylation as it plays an irreplaceable role in the development of complex diseases. A PageRank-based method was developed to identify disease-related genes from the constructed networks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we constructed PIN, weighted PIN (WPIN), TSN, WTSN for colon cancer and leukemia, respectively. The experimental results on colon cancer and leukemia show that the combination of tissue-specific data and DNA methylation can help to identify disease-related genes more accurately. Moreover, the PageRank-based method was effective to predict disease-related genes on the case studies of colon cancer and leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue-specific data and DNA methylation are two important factors to the study of human diseases. The same method implemented on the WTSN can achieve better results compared to those being implemented on original PIN, WPIN, or TSN. The PageRank-based method outperforms degree centrality-based method for identifying disease-related genes from WTSN.","['Li, Min', 'Zhang, Jiayi', 'Liu, Qing', 'Wang, Jianxin', 'Wu, Fang-Xiang']","['Li M', 'Zhang J', 'Liu Q', 'Wang J', 'Wu FX']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141022,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease/*genetics', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Protein Interaction Maps']",2014/10/29 06:00,2015/07/01 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-7-S2-S4 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-7-S2-S4 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2014;7 Suppl 2:S4. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-7-S2-S4.

Ponatinib is the only approved TKI capable of inhibiting BCR-ABL with the gatekeeper T315I kinase domain mutation, known to be the cause for 20% of resistant or relapsed CML cases. In 2013, ponatinib sales were temporarily suspended due to serious side effects seen in nearly 12% of the patient population.

Blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) attenuated cardiac fibrosis and improved the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure but the ligand for MR and the regulatory mechanism of MR pathway in the diseased heart are unclear. Here, we investigated whether glucocorticoids can promote cardiac fibrosis through MR in oxidative stress and the involvement of elongation factor eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL), a co-activator of MR, in this pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS: The MR antagonist eplerenone attenuated corticosterone-induced collagen synthesis assessed by [(3)H]proline incorporation in rat neonatal cultured cardiac fibroblasts in the presence of H2O2, as an oxidative stress but not in the absence of H2O2. H2O2 increased the ELL expression levels and MR-bound ELL. ELL expression levels and MR-bound ELL were also increased in the left ventricle of heart failure model rats with significant fibrosis and enhanced oxidative stress. Eplerenone did not attenuate corticosterone-induced increase of [(3)H]proline incorporation in the presence of H2O2 after knockdown of ELL expression using small interfering RNA in cardiac fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: Glucocorticoids can promote cardiac fibrosis via MR in oxidative stress, and oxidative stress modulates MR response to glucocorticoids through the interaction with ELL. Preventing cardiac fibrosis by modulating glucocorticoid-MR-ELL pathway may become a new therapeutic strategy for heart failure.","['Omori, Yosuke', 'Mano, Toshiaki', 'Ohtani, Tomohito', 'Sakata, Yasushi', 'Takeda, Yasuharu', 'Tamaki, Shunsuke', 'Tsukamoto, Yasumasa', 'Miwa, Takeshi', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhiro', 'Komuro, Issei']","['Omori Y', 'Mano T', 'Ohtani T', 'Sakata Y', 'Takeda Y', 'Tamaki S', 'Tsukamoto Y', 'Miwa T', 'Yamamoto K', 'Komuro I']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'daggerCardiovascular Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya 663-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'double daggerGenome Information Research Center, Osaka University, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'section signDivision of Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Multidisciplinary Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Tottori University Faculty of Medicine, Yonago 683-8504, Japan.', 'paragraph signDepartment of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141015,Japan,Yonago Acta Med,Yonago acta medica,0414002,,,,2014/10/29 06:00,2014/10/29 06:01,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Yonago Acta Med. 2014 Sep;57(3):109-16.

Persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow as measured by multidimensional flow cytometry (MDF) is a key early prognostic indicator and is strongly associated with EFS. We therefore hypothesized that obesity during induction would be associated with positive end-of-induction MRD (>/=0.01%). We analyzed MDF of end-induction bone marrow samples from a historical cohort of 198 children newly diagnosed with B-precursor ALL (BP-ALL) and treated with Children's Oncology Group induction regimens. We assessed the influence of body mass index on risk for positive end-induction MRD in the bone marrow. In our cohort of BP-ALL, 30 children (15.2%) were overweight and 41 (20.7%) were obese at diagnosis. Independent of established predictors of treatment response, obesity during induction was associated with significantly greater risk for persistent MRD (odds ratio, 2.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.19 to 5.54; P = .016). Obesity and overweight were associated with poorer EFS irrespective of end-induction MRD (P = .012). Obese children with newly diagnosed BP-ALL are at increased risk for positive end-induction MRD and poorer EFS.","['Orgel, Etan', 'Tucci, Jonathan', 'Alhushki, Waseem', 'Malvar, Jemily', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Fu, Cecilia H', 'Freyer, David R', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Mittelman, Steven D']","['Orgel E', 'Tucci J', 'Alhushki W', 'Malvar J', 'Sposto R', 'Fu CH', 'Freyer DR', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Mittelman SD']","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; Jonathan Jaques Children's Cancer Center, Miller Children's Hospital Long Beach, Long Beach, CA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA;"", ""Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; and."", 'Childrens Specialty Centers of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA;"", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA;"", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA;"", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA;"", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA;"", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; and.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141027,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Overweight', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",2014/10/29 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39559-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-08-595389 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 18;124(26):3932-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-08-595389.

Recently, mutations in STAT1, STAT5B, and STAT3 have been linked to development of immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked-like syndrome. Here, we immunologically characterized 3 patients with de novo activating mutations in the DNA binding or dimerization domains of STAT3 (p.K392R, p.M394T, and p.K658N, respectively). The patients displayed multiorgan autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and delayed-onset mycobacterial disease. Immunologically, we noted hypogammaglobulinemia with terminal B-cell maturation arrest, dendritic cell deficiency, peripheral eosinopenia, increased double-negative (CD4(-)CD8(-)) T cells, and decreased natural killer, T helper 17, and regulatory T-cell numbers. Notably, the patient harboring the K392R mutation developed T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia at age 14 years. Our results broaden the spectrum of phenotypes caused by activating STAT3 mutations, highlight the role of STAT3 in the development and differentiation of multiple immune cell lineages, and strengthen the link between the STAT family of transcription factors and autoimmunity.","['Haapaniemi, Emma M', 'Kaustio, Meri', 'Rajala, Hanna L M', 'van Adrichem, Arjan J', 'Kainulainen, Leena', 'Glumoff, Virpi', 'Doffinger, Rainer', 'Kuusanmaki, Heikki', 'Heiskanen-Kosma, Tarja', 'Trotta, Luca', 'Chiang, Samuel', 'Kulmala, Petri', 'Eldfors, Samuli', 'Katainen, Riku', 'Siitonen, Sanna', 'Karjalainen-Lindsberg, Marja-Liisa', 'Kovanen, Panu E', 'Otonkoski, Timo', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Heiskanen, Kaarina', 'Hanninen, Arno', 'Bryceson, Yenan T', 'Uusitalo-Seppala, Raija', 'Saarela, Janna', 'Seppanen, Mikko', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Kere, Juha']","['Haapaniemi EM', 'Kaustio M', 'Rajala HL', 'van Adrichem AJ', 'Kainulainen L', 'Glumoff V', 'Doffinger R', 'Kuusanmaki H', 'Heiskanen-Kosma T', 'Trotta L', 'Chiang S', 'Kulmala P', 'Eldfors S', 'Katainen R', 'Siitonen S', 'Karjalainen-Lindsberg ML', 'Kovanen PE', 'Otonkoski T', 'Porkka K', 'Heiskanen K', 'Hanninen A', 'Bryceson YT', 'Uusitalo-Seppala R', 'Saarela J', 'Seppanen M', 'Mustjoki S', 'Kere J']","['Folkhalsan Institute of Genetics and Research Programs Unit, Molecular Neurology, and.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland;', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;', 'Department of Pediatrics and Department of Medicine, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland;', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Medical Research Center Oulu, Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland;', ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Immunology, Addenbrooke's Hospital and National Institute for Health Research, Cambridge Biomedical Research Center, Cambridge, United Kingdom;"", 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland;', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Medical Research Center Oulu, Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland;

However, the importance of late-stage mediators of apoptosis in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis has not been elucidated. Here, we examine the role of caspase-9 (Casp9), the initiator caspase of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade, in murine fetal and adult hematopoiesis. Casp9 deficiency resulted in decreased erythroid and B-cell progenitor abundance and impaired function of hematopoietic stem cells after transplantation. Mouse bone marrow chimeras lacking Casp9 or its cofactor Apaf1 developed low white blood cell counts, decreased B-cell numbers, anemia, and reduced survival. Defects in apoptosis have also been previously implicated in susceptibility to therapy-related leukemia, a disease caused by exposure to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. We found that the burden of DNA damage was increased in Casp9-deficient cells after exposure to the alkylator, N-ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU). Furthermore, exome sequencing revealed that oligoclonal hematopoiesis emerged in Casp9-deficient bone marrow chimeras after alkylator exposure. Taken together, these findings suggest that defects in apoptosis could be a key step in the pathogenesis of alkylator-associated secondary malignancies.","['Lu, Elise Peterson', 'McLellan, Michael', 'Ding, Li', 'Fulton, Robert', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Wilson, Richard K', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Graubert, Timothy A']","['Lu EP', 'McLellan M', 'Ding L', 'Fulton R', 'Mardis ER', 'Wilson RK', 'Miller CA', 'Westervelt P', 'DiPersio JF', 'Link DC', 'Walter MJ', 'Ley TJ', 'Graubert TA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology.', 'The Genome Institute.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, The Genome Institute, Siteman Cancer Center, and.', 'The Genome Institute.', 'The Genome Institute, Siteman Cancer Center, and Department of Genetics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'The Genome Institute, Siteman Cancer Center, and Department of Genetics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'The Genome Institute.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, and Department of Genetics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, The Genome Institute, Siteman Cancer Center, and Department of Genetics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141027,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Caspase 9/*physiology', 'Crosses, Genetic', '*DNA Damage', 'Ethylnitrosourea/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism', 'Phenotype']",2014/10/29 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39554-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-582551 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 18;124(26):3887-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-582551.

A well-characterized member of this protein family is MEIS1, which orchestrates a transcriptional program required for the maintenance of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML). TGIF1/TGIF2 are relatively uncharacterized TALE transcription factors, which, in contrast to the remaining family, have been shown to act as transcriptional repressors. Given the general importance of this family in malignant hematopoiesis, we therefore tested the potential function of TGIF1 in the maintenance of MLL-rearranged AML. Gene expression analysis of MLL-rearranged patient blasts demonstrated reduced TGIF1 levels, and, in accordance, we find that forced expression of TGIF1 in MLL-AF9-transformed cells promoted differentiation and cell cycle exit in vitro, and delayed leukemic onset in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that TGIF1 interferes with a MEIS1-dependent transcriptional program by associating with MEIS1-bound regions in a competitive manner and that the MEIS1:TGIF1 ratio influence the clinical outcome.

To highlight this issue, we revised 128 patients with CML (M/F 64/64, median age at diagnosis 56.9 years, interquartile range 43.0-69.3) treated at our Institution with 1st line imatinib for at least 36 months and in stable complete cytogenetic response. At the 36th month of imatinib, a chronic anemia (Hb < 12 g/dl for > 6 months) was present in 38/128 patients (29.6%): the anemia was moderate (Hb > 8 </= 10 g/dl) in 12 patients (9.3%) and mild (Hb > 10 < 12 g/dl) in 26 patients (20.3%). All patients with persistent/late chronic anemia had a low reticulocyte count and 8/38 a condition of iron deficiency without clinical and instrumental signs of chronic blood loss. Four out of 38 patients (10.5%) needed red cell transfusions during the follow-up. At a landmark analysis from the 36th month of imatinib treatment, cumulative 4-year overall survival (OS) for patients with chronic anemia was 94.4% (CI 95% 83.8-100) compared to 93.5% (CI 95% 87.2-99.8) for patients without chronic anemia (P = 0.617). In conclusion, the occurrence of a late chronic anemia during long-lasting treatment with imatinib has been observed in about 30% of our responsive patients: its occurrence does not seem to affect OS, but its real impact should be evaluated on a larger cohort of patients.","['Latagliata, Roberto', 'Volpicelli, Paola', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Vozella, Federico', 'Romano, Angela', 'Montagna, Chiara', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Finsinger, Paola', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Serrao, Alessandra', 'Zacheo, Irene', 'Santopietro, Michelina', 'Salaroli, Adriano', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Latagliata R', 'Volpicelli P', 'Breccia M', 'Vozella F', 'Romano A', 'Montagna C', 'Molica M', 'Finsinger P', 'Carmosino I', 'Serrao A', 'Zacheo I', 'Santopietro M', 'Salaroli A', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University ""La Sapienza"" of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141119,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Reticulocytes/pathology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2014/10/29 06:00,2015/03/20 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23879 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Feb;90(2):105-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23879.

Dysregulation of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) activity has been implicated in cancer and other serious diseases. Thus, small molecule inhibitors against PRMT have great potential for therapeutic development. Herein, through the combination of virtual screening and bioassays, six small molecular compounds were identified as PRMT1 inhibitors. Amongst them, the binding affinity of compounds DCLX069 and DCLX078 with PRMT1 was further validated by T1rho and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR experiments. Most important of all, both compounds effectively blocked cell proliferation in breast cancer, liver cancer and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. The binding mode analysis from molecular docking simulations theoretically indicated that both inhibitors occupied the SAM binding pocket to exert the inhibitory effect.

These agents can amplify existent antitumour immunity or induce durable antitumour immune responses in a wide array of cancers. The spectrum of immunotherapeutics is broad, spanning monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives, tumour vaccines, and adoptive therapies using T cells and natural killer cells. Only a small number of immunotherapies have been tested in paediatric cancers, but impressive antitumour effects have already been observed. Mononclonal antibodies targeting GD2 that induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity improve survival in high-risk neuroblastoma. Bi-specific monoclonal antibodies that simultaneously target CD19 and activate T cells can induce remission in acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and adoptive immunotherapy using T cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors targeting CD19 induce impressive responses in B-ALL. Efforts are underway to generate and test new immunotherapies in a wider array of paediatric cancers. Major challenges include a need to identify immunotherapy targets on the most lethal childhood cancers, to expand availability of technology-intense platforms, such as adoptive cell therapy, to optimize management of novel toxicities associated with this new class of cancer therapies and to determine how best to incorporate these therapies into standard treatment paradigms.","['Mackall, Crystal L', 'Merchant, Melinda S', 'Fry, Terry J']","['Mackall CL', 'Merchant MS', 'Fry TJ']","['Paediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1104, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Paediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1104, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Paediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1104, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20141028,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

Although specific cancer types and clinical aggressiveness of tumors can be determined by DNA methylation status, the assessment of DNA methylation at multiple loci is not routinely performed in the clinical laboratory. METHODS: We recently described a novel microsphere-based assay for multiplex evaluation of DNA methylation. In the current study, we validated and used an improved assay [termed expedited microsphere HpaII small fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR (xMELP)] that can be performed with appropriate clinical turnaround time. RESULTS: Using the xMELP assay in conjunction with a new 17-locus random forest classifier that has been trained using 344 AML samples, we were able to segregate an independent cohort of 70 primary AML patients into methylation-determined subgroups with significantly distinct mortality risk (P = 0.009). We also evaluated precision, QC parameters, and preanalytic variables of the xMELP assay and determined the sensitivity of the random forest classifier score to failure at 1 or more loci. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that xMELP performance is suitable for implementation in the clinical laboratory and predicts AML outcome in an independent patient cohort.","['Wertheim, Gerald B W', 'Smith, Catherine', 'Luskin, Marlise', 'Rager, Alison', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Master, Stephen R']","['Wertheim GB', 'Smith C', 'Luskin M', 'Rager A', 'Figueroa ME', 'Carroll M', 'Master SR']","[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine."", ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia;"", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, and Abramson Research Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, srmaster@mail.med.upenn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141027,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'DNA/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2014/10/29 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2014.229781 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2014.229781 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2015 Jan;61(1):249-58. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2014.229781.

In this prospective study, we aimed to identify metabolic and genetic determinants of MTX toxicity. One hundred and thirty-four Dutch pediatric ALL patients were treated with four high infusions MTX (HD-MTX: 5 g m(-2)) every other week according to the DCOG-ALL-10 protocol. Mucositis (National Cancer Institute grade 3) was the most frequent occurring toxicity during the HD-MTX phase (20%) and occurred especially after the first MTX course. Mucositis was not associated with plasma MTX, plasma folate or plasma homocysteine levels. Patients with mucositis had higher erythrocyte folate levels at the start of protocol M than patients without mucositis (median 1.4 vs 1.2 mumol l(-1), P<0.008), this could reflect an increased MTX uptake in mucosal cells of patients with mucositis. From 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the MTX pathway, only patients with the wild-type variant of rs7317112 SNP in the ABCC4 gene had more mucositis (AA (39%) vs AG/GG (15%), P=0.016).

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is associated with fewer relapses. However, when studying effects of cGVHD on relapse, it is difficult to separate from acute GVHD effects as most cases of cGVHD occur within the first year after transplant at the time when acute GVHD is still active. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This study based on CIBMTR registry data investigated cGVHD and its association with the incidence of late relapse and survival in 7,489 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), who were leukemia free at 12 months after myeloablative allogeneic HCT. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of the study population was diagnosed with cGVHD at 12 months after transplant. The protective effect of cGVHD on late relapse was present only in patients with CML [RR, 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.59; P < 0.0001). cGVHD was significantly associated with higher risk of treatment-related mortality (TRM; RR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.09-2.82; P < 0.0001) and inferior overall survival (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.41-1.73; P < 0.0001) for all diseases. In patients with CML, all organ sites and presentation types of cGVHD were equally associated with lower risk of late relapse. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that clinically relevant antileukemia effects of cGVHD on late relapses are present only in CML but not in AML, ALL, or MDS. Chronic GVHD in patients who are 1-year survivors after myeloablative allogeneic HCT is primarily associated with higher TRM and inferior survival.","['Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Klein, John P', 'Hassebroek, Anna', 'Hemmer, Michael', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Bolwell, Brian J', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves Y', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Flowers, Mary E', 'Gale, Robert P', 'Herzig, Roger', 'Isola, Luis M', 'Jacobsohn, David A', 'Jagasia, Madan H', 'Klumpp, Thomas R', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Petersdorf, Effie W', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Wingard, John R', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Pavletic, Steven Z']","['Boyiadzis M', 'Arora M', 'Klein JP', 'Hassebroek A', 'Hemmer M', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Antin JH', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Cahn JY', 'Cairo MS', 'Cutler CS', 'Flowers ME', 'Gale RP', 'Herzig R', 'Isola LM', 'Jacobsohn DA', 'Jagasia MH', 'Klumpp TR', 'Lee SJ', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Santarone S', 'Spellman SR', 'Schouten HC', 'Verdonck LF', 'Wingard JR', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Horowitz MM', 'Pavletic SZ']","['University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. boyiadzism@upmc.edu.', 'University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Hopital Michallon, CHU de Grenoble, Grenoble, France.', 'New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.', 'University of Louisville Hospital/James Brown Cancer Center, Louisville, Kentucky.', 'Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami, Florida.', 'National Medical Center, Washington, DC.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Temple Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Ospedale Civile BMT Center, Pescara, Italy.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Academische Ziekenhuis Maastricht, Maastricht, the Netherlands.', 'Isala Clinics, Zwolle, the Netherlands.', 'Shands HealthCare and University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20141027,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/29 06:00,2016/04/01 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-0586 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0586 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 May 1;21(9):2020-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0586.

Gain-of-function genomic lesions of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway components are usually absent in CLL. We previously established that a BCR-mediated growth response in CLL is determined by the oncogene T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) through a sensitizer effect on AKT phospho-activation. Despite high clinical response rates following AKT-cascade inhibition in CLL, resistances in a substantial proportion of patients call for reliable pre- and post-exposure strata to better predict compound responses. Using a panel of inhibitors with differential vertical affinities in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis, we describe distinct patterns and determinants of sensitivities in 75 CLL samples. The compounds specifically impacted the BCR-induced physical TCL1-AKT interaction. In general, there was an efficient and tumor-selective abrogation of cell survival in suspension or protective stromal-cell cultures. However, biochemical and survival responses were heterogeneous across CLL and showed only incomplete overlap across inhibitors. Sensitivity clusters could be defined by differential responses to selective pan-PI3K inhibition vs. compounds acting more down-stream. An elevated PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation state conferred sensitivity or resistance, depending on the applied inhibitor. In fact, down-stream interception by mTOR or dual mTOR/PI3K inhibition appears more efficient in cases expressing the BCR-response and poor-risk determinants of ZAP70 or TCL1. Finally, exploiting the TCL1-AKT interaction, peptide-based TCL1-interphase mimics were potent in steric AKT antagonization and in reducing CLL cell survival. Overall, this study provides informative response relationships in AKT-pathway interception that can help refining predictive models in BCR-pathway inhibition in CLL.","['Schrader, Alexandra', 'Popal, Wagma', 'Lilienthal, Nils', 'Crispatzu, Giuliano', 'Mayer, Petra', 'Jones, Dan', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Herling, Marco']","['Schrader A', 'Popal W', 'Lilienthal N', 'Crispatzu G', 'Mayer P', 'Jones D', 'Hallek M', 'Herling M']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signaling and Oncoproteome, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Koln- Bonn and Cologne Cluster of Excellence in Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Germany. marco.herling@uk-koeln.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",2014/10/29 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['CCDT-EPUB-63081 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009614666141028101711 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2014;14(8):700-12. doi: 10.2174/1568009614666141028101711.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a proportion of NPMc+ AML cells cannot be cleared by conventional treatments. Therefore, we determined the therapeutic efficacy of deguelin that has demonstrated extensive biological activity with low toxicity. We previously reported that deguelin selectively reduces Mt NPM1, as well as induces differentiation and potentiates apoptosis in NPMc+ AML cells. Nevertheless, little information is available regarding the mechanism of deguelin-induced differentiation. Here, we investigated the role of deguelin in the induction of NPMc+ AML cell differentiation. Deguelin at the nontoxic concentration of 2 muM strongly inhibited cell growth but reduced apoptosis in OCI-AML3 cells carrying Mt NPM1, whereas the antiproliferative effect was minimal in OCIM2 cells harboring Wt NPM1. Compared with OCIM2 cells that showed no response, deguelin-treated OCI-AML3 cells exhibited the morphological features of granulocytic/monocytic differentiation, increased expression of differentiation antigens, and a nitroblue tetrazolium reduction activity. Induction of differentiation was associated with downregulation of Mt NPM1 and SIRT1, but not Wt NPM1, which was accompanied by an increase in CEBPbeta and G-CSFR expression, and further confirmed by sh-Mt NPM1 and sh-SIRT1. sh-Mt NPM1 treatment reduced SIRT1 expression, but did not change HDAC1/3 levels, suggesting that the decline of SIRT1 was partially accountable for the deguelin-induced, Mt-NPM1-related differentiation. Moreover, Mt NPM1 overexpression blocked deguelin-induced cell differentiation. Lastly, we showed that deguelin reduced the expression of Mt NPM1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that deguelin may be a therapeutic candidate for NPMc+ AML.","['Wang, You Ping', 'Yi, Sha', 'Wen, Lu', 'Zhang, Ben Ping', 'Zhao, Zichu', 'Hu, Jing Yu', 'Zhao, Fei', 'He, Jing', 'Fang, Jun', 'Zhang, Chun', 'Cui, Guohui', 'Chen, Yan']","['Wang YP', 'Yi S', 'Wen L', 'Zhang BP', 'Zhao Z', 'Hu JY', 'Zhao F', 'He J', 'Fang J', 'Zhang C', 'Cui G', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, P.R.

Pegaspargase (SS-PEG), a pegylated form of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase with a succinimidyl succinate (SS) linker, is the first-line asparaginase product used in Children's Oncology Group (COG) ALL trials. Calaspargase pegol (SC-PEG) replaces the SS linker in SS-PEG with a succinimidyl carbamate linker, creating a more stable molecule. COG AALL07P4 was designed to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparability of SC-PEG to SS-PEG in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk (HR) B-cell ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 165 evaluable patients were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive SC-PEG at 2,100 (SC-PEG2100; n = 69) or 2,500 IU/m(2) (SC-PEG2500; n = 42) versus SS-PEG 2,500 IU/m(2) (SS-PEG2500; n = 54) as part of an otherwise identical chemotherapy regimen. The groups were similar demographically, except more female patients received SC-PEG2500. RESULTS: The mean half-life of plasma asparaginase activity for both SC-PEG doses was approximately 2.5x longer than that of SS-PEG2500. The total systemic exposure, as defined by induction area under the curve from time 0 to 25 days, was greater with SC-PEG2500 than with SS-PEG2500 or SC-PEG2100. The proportion of patients with plasma asparaginase activity >/= 100 mIU/mL and >/= 400 mIU/mL was higher in patients who received SC-PEG as compared with SS-PEG2500. After one dose of pegylated asparaginase on induction day 4, plasma asparagine was undetectable for 11 days for SS-PEG2500 and 18 days for both SC-PEG groups. CONCLUSION: SC-PEG2500 achieves a significantly longer period of asparaginase activity above defined thresholds and asparagine depletion compared with SS-PEG2500 and has a comparable toxicity profile in children with HR B-cell ALL.","['Angiolillo, Anne L', 'Schore, Reuven J', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Keilani, Taha', 'Lane, Ashley R', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Wood, Brent', 'Wood, Charlotte', 'Zheng, Hao W', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Angiolillo AL', 'Schore RJ', 'Devidas M', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Carroll AJ', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Heerema NA', 'Keilani T', 'Lane AR', 'Loh ML', 'Reaman GH', 'Adamson PC', 'Wood B', 'Wood C', 'Zheng HW', 'Raetz EA', 'Winick NJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP']","[""Anne L.

Patients with intermediate activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT(IA)) have higher cytosol 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels. We investigated toxicity following HD-MTX during MTX/6MP maintenance therapy in relation to 6MP and TPMT. METHODS: Using linear mixed models, we explored myelo- and hepatotoxicity in relation to 6MP dosage and TPMT phenotype following 1,749 HD-MTX courses to 411 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on maintenance therapy. RESULTS: The degree of myelosuppression following HD-MTX was similar for patients with TPMT(IA) and patients with high TPMT activity (TPMT(HA)), when HD-MTX started with same blood counts and 6MP doses. However, since TPMT(IA) had lower blood counts at initiation of HD-MTX compared with TPMT(HA) patients (median WBC 2.8 vs. 3.3 x 10(9)/L, P = 0.01; median ANC 1.4 vs. 1.7 x 10(9)/L, P = 0.02), TPMT(IA) continued to have lower WBC and ANC levels compared with TPMT(HA) during all 28 days after HD-MTX [relative difference 9 % (95 % CI 2-17), P = 0.02 and 21 % (95 % CI 6-39), P = 0.005]. Still, the fractional decrease in WBC and ANC levels after HD-MTX did not differ between TPMT(IA) and TPMT(HA) patients (P = 0.47; P = 0.38). The degree of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and rise in aminotransferases were all significantly related to 6MP dose (P < 0.001 for all analyses). CONCLUSION: For both TPMT(IA) and TPMT(HA) patients, dose of 6MP prior to HD-MTX should be guided by pre-HD-MTX blood counts, but not by TPMT activity.","['Levinsen, Mette', 'Rosthoj, Susanne', 'Nygaard, Ulrikka', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Bechensteen, Anne Grete', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Frandsen, Thomas L', 'Weinshilboum, Richard M', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Levinsen M', 'Rosthoj S', 'Nygaard U', 'Heldrup J', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Jonsson OG', 'Bechensteen AG', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Lausen B', 'Frandsen TL', 'Weinshilboum RM', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141028,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis']",2014/10/29 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2613-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Jan;75(1):59-66. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2613-7.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the augmentative property of SA on saporin and saporin-based immunotoxins (IT) directed against five different cell surface target molecules on human leukemia and lymphoma cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After determining the optimum dose of SA for each cell line, the extent of SA-mediated augmentation was established for saporin and five saporin-based ITs using XTT and an annexin V apoptosis assay. Immunospecificity was investigated using three different blocking assays. Dose-scheduling was also investigated using the XTT assay. RESULTS: Uncorrected SA-mediated augmentation ranged at best from 31.5 million-fold to, at worse, 174-fold. However, when the calculated fold-increases were adjusted for the non-immunospecific effects of SA on an off-target IT, the true augmentative effects of SA were found to be largely non-immunospecific. Antibody blocking studies demonstrated that the augmentative effect of SA was only partially immunospecific. Separate exposure of target cells to IT and SA at different times demonstrated that immunospecific augmentation of IT by SA could be achieved but only if cells were exposed to IT first and SA second. CONCLUSIONS: SA significantly, although variably, augments the cytotoxicity of saporin and saporin-based immunotoxins. Concomitant exposure to both IT and SA can result in non-immunospecific cytotoxicity that can be overcome by temporally separating exposure to each.","['Holmes, Suzanne E', 'Bachran, Christopher', 'Fuchs, Hendrik', 'Weng, Alexander', 'Melzig, Matthias F', 'Flavell, Sopsamorn U', 'Flavell, David J']","['Holmes SE', 'Bachran C', 'Fuchs H', 'Weng A', 'Melzig MF', 'Flavell SU', 'Flavell DJ']","['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital , Southampton , UK .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141027,England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/drug effects/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Saponins/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Saporins', 'Triterpenes/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2014/10/28 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/10/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08923973.2014.971964 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2015 Feb;37(1):42-55. doi: 10.3109/08923973.2014.971964.

Clinically, we have determined that more than 70% of lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/leukemia bone marrow extracts display a hypermethylated PLK4 promoter region in comparison to the normal. Decreased PLK4 protein expression due to promoter hypermethylation was negatively correlated with JAK2 overexpression, a common occurrence in hematological malignancies. In vitro examination of the PLKs under biologically relevant condition of 5% O2 revealed that the highly conserved PLKs respond to lower oxygen tension at both the DNA and the protein level.

MLL3 plays crucial roles in multiple metabolic processes. However, the physiological roles of MLL4 in metabolism and the relationship between MLL3 and MLL4 in metabolic gene regulation are unclear. To address these issues, we analyzed the phenotypes of newly generated MLL4 mutant mice, along with MLL3 mutant and MLL3;MLL4 compound mutant mice. We also performed comparative genome-wide transcriptome analyses in livers of MLL3, MLL4, and MLL3;MLL4 mutant mice. These analyses revealed that MLL3 and MLL4 complexes are key epigenetic regulators of common metabolic processes and the hepatic circadian clock. Subsequent mechanistic analyses uncovered that MLL3/4 complexes function as pivotal coactivators of the circadian transcription factors (TFs), retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-alpha and -gamma, in the hepatic circadian clock. Consistent with disturbed hepatic clock gene expression in MLL4 mutant mice, we found that rhythmic fluctuation of hepatic and serum bile acid (BA) levels over the circadian cycle is abolished in MLL4 mutant mice. Our analyses also demonstrate that MLL4 primarily impinges on hepatic BA production among several regulatory pathways to control BA homeostasis. Together, our results provide strong in vivo support for important roles of both MLL3 and MLL4 in similar metabolic pathways. CONCLUSION: Both MLL3 and MLL4 complexes act as major epigenetic regulators of diverse metabolic processes (including circadian control of bile acid homeostasis) and as critical transcriptional coactivators of the circadian TFs, RORs.","['Kim, Dae-Hwan', 'Rhee, Jennifer Chiyeon', 'Yeo, Sujeong', 'Shen, Rongkun', 'Lee, Soo-Kyung', 'Lee, Jae W', 'Lee, Seunghee']","['Kim DH', 'Rhee JC', 'Yeo S', 'Shen R', 'Lee SK', 'Lee JW', 'Lee S']","['Neuroscience Section, Pape Family Pediatric Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (RORA protein, human)', '0 (Rorc protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.14.23 (Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 1.14.14.23 (Cyp7a1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bile Acids and Salts/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics', 'Circadian Clocks/*physiology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*physiology', '*Homeostasis', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1/physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/physiology']",2014/10/28 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/10/28 06:00'],"['2014/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.27578 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2015 Mar;61(3):1012-23. doi: 10.1002/hep.27578.

Studies suggest that early molecular response (EMR) is a good indicator of a favorable prognosis and yet, to the authors' knowledge, the use of EMR as a robust surrogate marker for clinical response has yet to be fully explored. EMR to therapy appears to be affected by a variety of factors, including disease characteristics, risk score, adherence to treatment, and off-target effects of the treatment. Therefore, although molecular markers improve important research, they also bring with them important questions regarding their reliability. To be useful, markers must be must be easily measureable, capable of generating meaningful data, and clinically relevant. BCR-ABL1 is the hallmark marker in chronic myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, investigators still struggle with how best to measure and interpret both high and very low BCR-ABL1 levels. Statistical models of BCR-ABL1 kinetics must address these concerns and account for the BCR-ABL1 variability between and within patients.

Patients with low mDC levels at CR were more likely to suffer from complicated infections, although the difference was not statistically significant. Altogether, there was a profound decrease in DC levels in patients with AML at diagnosis. DC levels increased at CR and were higher than in hospital controls after post-remission therapy, suggesting that DCs recover after repeated chemotherapy. There may be an association between mDC levels and infectious complications.","['Derolf, A R', 'Laane, E', 'Bjorklund, E', 'Saft, L', 'Bjorkholm, M', 'Porwit, Anna']","['Derolf AR', 'Laane E', 'Bjorklund E', 'Saft L', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Porwit A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Count', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/28 06:00,2015/01/24 06:00,['2014/10/28 06:00'],"['2014/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/sji.12223 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2014 Dec;80(6):424-31. doi: 10.1111/sji.12223.,,,,,,,,['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three cases of T-LBL associated with LCH were included. The morphologic characteristics were reviewed along with immunohistochemical profiling using EnVision method and TCR gene rearrangement by PCR. A review of composite lymphoma previously reported in the literature was performed. RESULTS: All three patients were male with the mean age of 61.7 years. One was Hans and the other 2 were Uyguers. All presented with superficial lymph node enlargement. Biopsy of lymph node showed two abnormal cell populations: distended sinus by large, pale histiocytes with nuclear grooves, and the interfollicular region containing immature-appearing cells with irregular nuclei slightly larger than that of small lymphocyte, dispersed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, scant cytoplasm, and scattered mitotic figures. These cells presented in aggregates and small sheets interspersed with normal-appearing lymphocyte. The histiocytes were positive for CD1a, S-100 protein and CD68. The lymphoma cells were positive for CD3, CD7, TdT and CD34. TCR-gamma gene rearrangement was detected in one case by PCR technology. One case involved bone marrow with double phenotype acute leukemia. Amongst the 8 including 5 reported cases, there were 4 males and 4 females. The mean age of the patients and the median age were 54 years. Lymphoadenopathy was the most common presentation. Bone marrow was involved in 4 cases. The time of follow-up was 2 to 27 months. The median survival was 5.5 months and the one-year survival rate was 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of T-LBL and LCH should be based on typical morphology, immunophenotype and molecular genetic findings, with differential diagnoses including Langerhans cell hyperplasia originated from dermatopathic lymphadenopathy. When involving lymph node, extensive sampling supplemented by immunohistochemical staining is important to reach a correct diagnosis. Although coexistent T-LBL and LCH is clonally related, the understanding of its pathogenesis requires further investigation.","['Li, Xinxia', 'Wang, Ye', 'Chen, Rong', 'Abulaiti, Dilinazi', 'Ma, Zhiping', 'Miao, Na', 'Abulajiang, Gulinaer', 'Zhang, Wei']","['Li X', 'Wang Y', 'Chen R', 'Abulaiti D', 'Ma Z', 'Miao N', 'Abulajiang G', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, China.

However, this increased longevity where in many cases an individual suffers from several such chronic diseases simultaneously, making treatment complex. Finding whether diseases can coexist in an individual by chance or there exists a possible association between them is vital. Our goal is to establish possible existing link among CVD, cancer and Parkinson's disease (PD) for better understanding of the associated molecular network. In this study, we integrated multiple dataset retrieved from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information's Gene Expression Omnibus database, and took a systems-biology approach to compare and distinguish the molecular network associated with PD, cancer and CVD. We identified 230, 308 and 1619 differentially expressed genes for CVD, cancer and PD dataset respectively using cut off p value<0.5 and fold change>2. We integrated these data with known pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool and found following common pathways associated with all three diseases to be most affected; epithelial adherens junction signaling, remodelling of epithelial adherens junctions, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, sphingomyelin metabolism, 3- phosphoinositide biosynthesis, acute myeloid leukemia signaling, type I diabetes mellitus signaling, agrin interactions at neuromuscular junction, role of IL-17A in arthritis, and antigen presentation pathways.

Although in its infancy, we have also begun to understand the complex dynamics of subclonal diversity and its impact on disease outcome. From pioneering studies, we know that certain genetic events are found in the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and are considered as 'clonal driver mutations' (e.g., +12, 13q-), whereas others, present only in a fraction of the tumor, are deemed to be 'subclonal driver mutations' for example, TP53 and SF3B1. Over the coming years, we need to gain a deeper insight into the dynamics of this subclonal architecture to understand how, at an individual level, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients should be followed, which will be particularly relevant as novel targeted therapies begin to emerge.","['Sutton, Lesley-Ann', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Sutton LA', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, SE-751-85, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141027,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['*Clonal Evolution', 'Disease Progression', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",2014/10/28 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2014/10/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2015.972930 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2015 Feb;8(1):71-8. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2015.972930.

The EuroFlow Consortium has established a fully standardized ""all-in-one"" pipeline consisting of standardized instrument settings, reagent panels, and sample preparation protocols and software for data analysis and disease classification. For its reproducible implementation, parallel development of a quality assurance (QA) program was required. Here, we report on the results of four consecutive annual rounds of the novel external QA EuroFlow program. The novel QA scheme aimed at monitoring the whole flow cytometric analysis process (cytometer setting, sample preparation, acquisition and analysis) by reading the median fluorescence intensities (MedFI) of defined lymphocytes' subsets. Each QA participant applied the predefined reagents' panel on blood cells of local healthy donors. A uniform gating strategy was applied to define lymphocyte subsets and to read MedFI values per marker. The MedFI values were compared with reference data and deviations from reference values were quantified using performance score metrics. In four annual QA rounds, we analyzed 123 blood samples from local healthy donors on 14 different instruments in 11 laboratories from nine European countries. The immunophenotype of defined cellular subsets appeared sufficiently standardized to permit unified (software) data analysis. The coefficient of variation of MedFI for 7 of 11 markers performed repeatedly below 30%, average MedFI in each QA round ranged from 86 to 125% from overall median. Calculation of performance scores was instrumental to pinpoint standardization failures and their causes. Overall, the new EuroFlow QA system for the first time allowed to quantify the technical variation that is introduced in the measurement of fluorescence intensities in a multicentric setting over an extended period of time. EuroFlow QA is a proficiency test specific for laboratories that use standardized EuroFlow protocols. It may be used to complement, but not replace, established proficiency tests.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Patients with neoplastic meningitis were recruited by a retrospective search of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytopathological report database of Siriraj Hospital between 1997 and 2006. Clinical information and CSF result of these patients were extracted from their medical records. Neuroimagings were reviewed by a neuroradiologist. RESULTS: The present study revealed 40 cases of neoplastic meningitis, which comprised of 17 cases with carcinomatous meningitis (CM) and 23 lymphoma/leukemia meningitis (LM) cases. In patients with CM, the majority (70%) had adenocarcinoma of lung or breast. Three of 17 cases with unknown primary tumor had carcinomatous meningitis as an initial presentation. In LM most of the cases (70%) were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The most common symptom among patients with CM and LM was headache follow by cranial nerve palsy. In CM cases, CSF cytology was positive in the first specimen in 15 cases (82.35%) and in 22 from 23 cases (95.7%) in LM cases. Overall CSF showed pleocytosis in 36 cases (90%), most of which were lymphocyte predominant. The most common findings from brain imagings were leptomeningeal enhancement and hydrocephalus. CONCLUSION: The common primary sites were lung and breast cancer in the CM group and ALL and NHL in the LM group. The common symptoms were headache and cranial nerve palsy. Routine CSF examination was abnormal in virtually all cases. Positive CSF cytology was a gold standard for a diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastasis. High index of suspicious and awareness were required to avoid miss diagnosis.","['Jearanaisilp, Sorrawit', 'Sangruji, Tumthip', 'Danchaivijitr, Chotipat', 'Danchaivijitr, Nasuda']","['Jearanaisilp S', 'Sangruji T', 'Danchaivijitr C', 'Danchaivijitr N']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Meningitis/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/pathology', 'Neuroimaging/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies']",2014/10/28 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/10/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2014 Aug;97(8):870-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been shown to induce apoptosis and reduce the growth of various types of cancer but not normal cells. Colorectal cancer cells HCT116, HCT116 p53(-/-), and HCT116 Bax(-/-), were treated with DCA in vitro. Response to treatment was determined by measuring PDH phosphorylation, apoptosis, proliferation, and cell cycle. Molecular changes associated with these responses were determined using western immunoblotting and quantitative PCR. Treatment with 20 mM DCA did not increase apoptosis, despite decreasing levels of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 after 6 h, in any of the cell lines observed. Mcl-1 expression was stabilized with MG-132, an inhibitor of proteasomal degradation. A decrease in Mcl-1 correlated with a decrease in proliferation, both of which showed dose-dependence in DCA treated cells. Cells showed nuclear localization of Mcl-1, however cell cycle was unaffected by DCA treatment. These data suggest that a reduction in the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 due to increased proteasomal degradation is correlated with the ability of DCA to reduce proliferation of HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells without causing apoptosis.","['Delaney, L M', 'Ho, N', 'Morrison, J', 'Farias, N R', 'Mosser, D D', 'Coomber, B L']","['Delaney LM', 'Ho N', 'Morrison J', 'Farias NR', 'Mosser DD', 'Coomber BL']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9LSH52S3LQ (Dichloroacetic Acid)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dichloroacetic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics']",2014/10/27 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2014/10/27 06:00'],"['2014/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-014-1046-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2015 Jan;20(1):63-74. doi: 10.1007/s10495-014-1046-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of the TAM family, due to its central role in mediating cellular proliferation, has been implicated in multiple diseases. Axl was cloned as the first TAM receptor in a search for genes involved in the progression of chronic to acute-phase leukemia, and has since been established as playing a critical role in the progression of cancer. The oncogenic nature of Axl is demonstrated through its activation of signaling pathways involved in proliferation, migration, inhibition of apoptosis, and therapeutic resistance. Despite its recent discovery, significant progress has been made in the development of effective clinical therapeutics targeting Axl.

Here we report that in vivo cyclin C acts as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor, by controlling Notch1 oncogene levels. Cyclin C activates an 'orphan' CDK19 kinase, as well as CDK8 and CDK3. These cyclin-C-CDK complexes phosphorylate the Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN1) and promote ICN1 degradation. Genetic ablation of cyclin C blocks ICN1 phosphorylation in vivo, thereby elevating ICN1 levels in cyclin-C-knockout mice. Cyclin C ablation or heterozygosity collaborates with other oncogenic lesions and accelerates development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Furthermore, the cyclin C encoding gene CCNC is heterozygously deleted in a significant fraction of human T-ALLs, and these tumours express reduced cyclin C levels. We also describe point mutations in human T-ALL that render cyclin-C-CDK unable to phosphorylate ICN1. Hence, tumour cells may develop different strategies to evade inhibition by cyclin C.","['Li, Na', 'Fassl, Anne', 'Chick, Joel', 'Inuzuka, Hiroyuki', 'Li, Xiaoyu', 'Mansour, Marc R', 'Liu, Lijun',

FTY720, a new immunosuppressant, derived from ISP-1, has been studied for its putative anti-cancer properties. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which FTY720 mediates antitumor effects in cholangiocarcinoma (CC) cells. METHODS: Three CC cell lines were examined, QBC939, TFK-1, and HuCCT1. The therapeutic effects of FTY720 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, invasive potential, and epithelial- mesenchy-mal transition (EMT) were examined. RESULTS: FTY720 greatly inhibited CC cells proliferation and EMT in vitro and in vivo, and this effect was associated with dephosphorylation of STAT3tyr705. FTY720 induced apoptosis and G1 phase arrest in CC cells, and inhibited invasion of CC cells. Western blot analysis showed that FTY720 induced cleavage of caspases 3, 8 and 9, and of PARP, in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with a substantial decrease in p-STAT3, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, survivin, cyclin D1, cyclin E, N-cadherin, vimentin, VEGF and TWIST1. In vivo studies showed that tumor growth and metastasis were significantly suppressed after FTY720 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FTY720 induces a significant decrease in p-STAT3, which inhibits proliferation and EMT of CC cells, and then induces G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. We have characterized a novel immunosuppressant, which shows potential anti-tumor effects on CC via p-STAT3 inhibition. FTY720 merits further investigation and warrants clinical evaluation.","['Lu, Zhaoyang', 'Wang, Jiabei', 'Zheng, Tongsen', 'Liang, Yingjian', 'Yin, Dalong', 'Song, Ruipeng', 'Pei, Tiemin', 'Pan, Shangha', 'Jiang, Hongchi', 'Liu, Lianxin']","['Lu Z', 'Wang J', 'Zheng T', 'Liang Y', 'Yin D', 'Song R', 'Pei T', 'Pan S', 'Jiang H', 'Liu L']","['Department of Hepatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, No, 23 Youzheng Street, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin 150001, China. liulianxin@ems.hrbmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141025,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*drug effects', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Propylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/10/27 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/10/27 06:00'],"['2014/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-783 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-783 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Oct 25;14:783. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-783.,,,,PMC4221672,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although As2O3 is known to regulate activation of several signaling cascades, the key events, accounting for its antileukemic properties, remain to be defined. We provide evidence that arsenic can directly bind to cysteine 299 in AMPKalpha and inhibit its activity. This inhibition of AMPK by arsenic is required in part for its cytotoxic effects on primitive leukemic progenitors from patients with AML, while concomitant treatment with an AMPK activator antagonizes in vivo the arsenic-induced antileukemic effects in a xenograft AML mouse model. A consequence of AMPK inhibition is activation of the mTOR pathway as a negative regulatory feedback loop. However, when AMPK expression is lost, arsenic-dependent activation of the kinase RSK downstream of MAPK activity compensates the generation of regulatory feedback signals through phosphorylation of downstream mTOR targets. Thus, therapeutic regimens with As2O3 will need to include inhibitors of both the mTOR and RSK pathways in combination to prevent engagement of negative feedback loops and maximize antineoplastic responses.","['Beauchamp, Elspeth M', 'Kosciuczuk, Ewa M', 'Serrano, Ruth', 'Nanavati, Dhaval', 'Swindell, Elden P', 'Viollet, Benoit', ""O'Halloran, Thomas V"", 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Beauchamp EM', 'Kosciuczuk EM', 'Serrano R', 'Nanavati D', 'Swindell EP', 'Viollet B', ""O'Halloran TV"", 'Altman JK', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Amongst this plethora of genetic changes, NOTCH1 activating mutations stand out as the most frequently occurring genetic defect, identified in more than 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, supporting a role as an essential driver for this gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis. In this study, we aimed to establish a comprehensive compendium of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome under control of Notch signaling. For this purpose, we measured the transcriptional response of all protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs upon pharmacological Notch inhibition in the human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CUTLL1 using RNA-sequencing. Similar Notch dependent profiles were established for normal human CD34(+) thymic T-cell progenitors exposed to Notch signaling activity in vivo. In addition, we generated long non-coding RNA expression profiles (array data) from ex vivo isolated Notch active CD34(+) and Notch inactive CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and from a primary cohort of 15 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with known NOTCH1 mutation status. Integration of these expression datasets with publicly available Notch1 ChIP-sequencing data resulted in the identification of long non-coding RNAs directly regulated by Notch activity in normal and malignant T cells. Given the central role of Notch in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis, these data pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target hyperactive Notch signaling in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Durinck, Kaat', 'Wallaert, Annelynn', 'Van de Walle, Inge', 'Van Loocke, Wouter', 'Volders, Pieter-Jan', 'Vanhauwaert, Suzanne', 'Geerdens, Ellen', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Poppe, Bruce', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Cools, Jan', 'Mestdagh, Pieter', 'Vandesompele, Jo', 'Rondou, Pieter', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Speleman, Frank']","['Durinck K', 'Wallaert A', 'Van de Walle I', 'Van Loocke W', 'Volders PJ', 'Vanhauwaert S', 'Geerdens E', 'Benoit Y', 'Van Roy N', 'Poppe B', 'Soulier J', 'Cools J', 'Mestdagh P', 'Vandesompele J', 'Rondou P', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Taghon T', 'Speleman F']","['Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium; kaat.durinck@ugent.be franki.speleman@ugent.be.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Genome Rearrangements and Cancer Laboratory, U944 INSERM, University Paris Diderot and Hematology Laboratory, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium;', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium; kaat.durinck@ugent.be franki.speleman@ugent.be.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141024,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",2014/10/26 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/10/26 06:00'],"['2014/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.115683 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.115683 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Dec;99(12):1808-16. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.115683.

We investigated the possible positive or negative impact of these drugs on all known mechanisms of action of both type I and type II anti-CD20 antibodies. Pretreatment with ibrutinib for 1 hour did not increase direct cell death of cell lines or chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples mediated by anti-CD20 antibodies. Pre-treatment with ibrutinib did not inhibit complement activation or complement-mediated lysis. In contrast, ibrutinib strongly inhibited all cell-mediated mechanisms induced by anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab, ofatumumab or obinutuzumab, either in purified systems or whole blood assays. Activation of natural killer cells, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by these cells, as well as phagocytosis by macrophages or neutrophils were inhibited by ibrutinib with a half maximal effective concentration of 0.3-3 muM. Analysis of anti-CD20 mediated activation of natural killer cells isolated from patients on continued oral ibrutinib treatment suggested that repeated drug dosing inhibits these cells in vivo. Finally we show that the phosphatidyl-4-5-biphosphate 3-kinase-delta inhibitor idelalisib similarly inhibited the immune cell-mediated mechanisms induced by anti-CD20 antibodies, although the effects of this drug at 10 muM were weaker than those observed with ibrutinib at the same concentration. We conclude that the design of combined treatment schedules of anti-CD20 antibodies with these kinase inhibitors should consider the multiple negative interactions between these two classes of drugs.","['Da Roit, Fabio', 'Engelberts, Patrick J', 'Taylor, Ronald P', 'Breij, Esther C W', 'Gritti, Giuseppe', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Introna, Martino', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'Beurskens, Frank J', 'Golay, Josee']","['Da Roit F', 'Engelberts PJ', 'Taylor RP', 'Breij EC', 'Gritti G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Introna M', 'Parren PW', 'Beurskens FJ', 'Golay J']","['Center of Cellular Therapy ""G.

For the assessment of International Prognostic Scoring Systems, an adequate chromosome banding analysis of the bone marrow is essential. Cytogenetic information is not available for a substantial number of patients (5%-20%) with dry marrow or an insufficient number of metaphase cells. For these patients, a valid risk classification is impossible. In the study presented here, the International Prognostic Scoring Systems were validated based on fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses using extended probe panels applied to cluster of differentiation 34 positive (CD34(+)) peripheral blood cells of 328 MDS patients of our prospective multicenter German diagnostic study and compared to chromosome banding results of 2902 previously published patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. For cytogenetic risk classification by fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of CD34(+) peripheral blood cells, the groups differed significantly for overall and leukemia-free survival by uni- and multivariate analyses without discrepancies between treated and untreated patients. Including cytogenetic data of fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of peripheral CD34(+) blood cells (instead of bone marrow banding analysis) into the complete International Prognostic Scoring System assessment, the prognostic risk groups separated significantly for overall and leukemia-free survival. Our data show that a reliable stratification to the risk groups of the International Prognostic Scoring Systems is possible from peripheral blood in patients with missing chromosome banding analysis by using a comprehensive probe panel (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:01355913).","['Braulke, Friederike', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Muller-Thomas, Catharina', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Nolte, Florian', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles A N', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Greenberg, Peter L', 'Bennett, John M', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Mallo, Mar', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Tuchler, Heinz', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Nosslinger, Thomas', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Shirneshan, Katayoon', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Trumper, Lorenz', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Schanz, Julie']","['Braulke F', 'Platzbecker U', 'Muller-Thomas C', 'Gotze K', 'Germing U', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Nolte F', 'Hofmann WK', 'Giagounidis AA', 'Lubbert M', 'Greenberg PL', 'Bennett JM', 'Sole F', 'Mallo M', 'Slovak ML', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Le Beau MM', 'Tuchler H', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Nosslinger T', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Shirneshan K', 'Aul C', 'Stauder R', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P', 'Fonatsch C', 'Trumper L', 'Haase D', 'Schanz J']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medicine of Goettingen, Germany friederike.braulke@med.uni-goettingen.de.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Technical University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Technical University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Uniklinik, Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Marienhospital, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Stanford University Cancer Center, CA, USA.', 'University of Rochester Medical Center, NY, USA.', 'Institut de Recerca Contra la Leucemia Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain.', 'Institut de Recerca Contra la Leucemia Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain.', 'Sonora Quest Laboratories, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'University of Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Hanusch Hospital, Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department for Hematology and Oncology and L.

The recently identified IgM receptor FcmuR is overexpressed on malignant B cells in CLL and mediates the rapid internalization and lysosomal shuttling of IgM via its Fc fragment (Fcmu). To exploit this internalization and trafficking pathway for targeted drug delivery, we engineered an IgM-derived protein scaffold (Fcmu) and linked it with the cytotoxic agent monomethylauristatin F. This Fcmu-drug conjugate was selectively toxic for FcmuR-expressing cell lines in vitro and for CLL cells but not autologous normal T cells ex vivo. Notably, the cytotoxic activity of the Fcmu-drug conjugate was maintained in CLL cells carrying a 17p deletion, which predicts resistance to standard chemotherapy. Next, we tested the possible therapeutic application of the Fcmu-drug conjugate in immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL-2Rgamma(null) (NSG) mice engrafted with peripheral blood cells from patients with leukemia. Three intravenous injections of the Fcmu-drug conjugate over a 10-day period were well tolerated and selectively killed the human CLL cells but not the coengrafted autologous human T cells. In summary, we developed a novel strategy for targeted cytotoxic therapy of CLL based on the unique properties of FcmuR. FcmuR-targeted drug delivery showed potent and specific therapeutic activity in CLL, thus providing proof of concept for FcmuR as a valuable therapeutic target in CLL and for IgM-based antibody-drug conjugates as a new targeting platform.","['Vire, Berengere', 'Skarzynski, Martin', 'Thomas, Joshua D', 'Nelson, Christopher G', 'David, Alexandre', 'Aue, Georg', 'Burke, Terrence R Jr', 'Rader, Christoph', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Vire B', 'Skarzynski M', 'Thomas JD', 'Nelson CG', 'David A', 'Aue G', 'Burke TR Jr', 'Rader C', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Laboratory, Molecular Discovery Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Laboratory, Molecular Discovery Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Laboratory of Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Laboratory, Molecular Discovery Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The Scripps Research Institute, Scripps Florida, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20141024,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (immunoglobulin M receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/10/26 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/10/26 06:00'],"['2014/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2030 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2014 Dec 15;74(24):7510-7520. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2030.

Cancer cells as compared to normal cells are under increased oxidative stress and show high copper level. These differences between cancer cells and normal cells can be targeted to develop effective cancer therapy. Pro-oxidant property of 6MP in the presence of metal ions is not well documented. Redox cycling of Cu(II) to Cu(I) was found to be efficiently mediated by 6MP. We have performed a series of in vitro experiments to demonstrate the pro-oxidant property of 6MP in the presence of Cu(II). Studies on human lymphocytes confirmed the DNA damaging ability of 6MP in the presence of Cu(II). Since 6MP possesses DNA damaging ability by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of Cu(II), it may also possess apoptosis-inducing activity by involving endogenous copper ions. Essentially, this would be an alternative and copper-dependent pathway for anticancer activity of 6MP.","['Rehman, Sayeed Ur', 'Zubair, Haseeb', 'Sarwar, Tarique', 'Husain, Mohammed Amir', 'Ishqi, Hassan Mubarak', 'Nehar, Shamshun', 'Tabish, Mohammad']","['Rehman SU', 'Zubair H', 'Sarwar T', 'Husain MA', 'Ishqi HM', 'Nehar S', 'Tabish M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences, A.

METHODS: Three hundred and eighteen children who were newly diagnosed with ALL between January 1999 and December 2007 were enrolled in this study. Among the 318 children, 83 children who hospitalized before December 2002 were treated with CAMSBDH-ALL99 protocol, including 48 patients of standard risk and 35 patients of high risk. The patients (n=235; 131 in standard risk and 104 in high risk) who hospitalized after December 2002 were treated with CAMSBDH-ALL03 protocol. Patients in the CAMSBDH-ALL99 protocol group were treated with conventional chemotherapy. CAMSBDH-ALL03 protocol was modified based on the CAMSBDH-ALL99 protocol. RESULTS: The long-term overall survival (OS) and event-free-survival (EFS) in the CAMSBDH-ALL03 group was significantly higher than in the CAMSBDH-ALL99 (P&lt;0.01). The long-term OS and EFS of standard risk and high risk patients in the CAMSBDH-ALL03 protocol group were significantly higher than in the CAMSBDH-ALL99 protocol group (P&lt;0.01). The CAMSBDH-ALL03 protocol group showed a significantly lower recurrence rate (28.9%) than in the CAMSBDH-ALL99 protocol group (50.6%) (P&lt;0.05). The mortality rate in the CAMSBDH-ALL03 protocol group was 28.5% vs 56.6% in the CAMSBDH-ALL99 protocol group (P&lt;0.05).

These leukaemias differ from the non-DS-related types of leukaemia and are thought to be distinct biological entities. AIMS: To perform a retrospective review of our experience of treating DS-related leukaemia at Our Lady's Children's Hospital. METHODS: Data were extracted from a database established in 2000 to prospectively gather data on DS-associated leukaemias and their outcomes following polychemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with DS-ML were treated and 19 with DS-ALL. Sixteen (84%) patients with DS-ML are alive and in complete remission with a median follow-up of 7 years. All deaths in this cohort were due to treatment-related mortality (TRM). Of the DS-ALL patients, 12 (63%) remain alive with a median follow-up of 3.6 years. TRM accounted for five of the six deaths. One death was due to leukaemic relapse. CONCLUSION: High cure rates are seen in DS-ML using contemporary polychemotherapy protocols, however, there is significant TRM in this cohort. DS-ALL does not have the same high cure rate as non-DS-ALL (>90%) and again this is mainly due to an excess of TRM.","[""O'Rafferty, C"", 'Kelly, J', 'Storey, L', 'Ryan, C', ""O'Marcaigh, A"", 'Smith, O']","[""O'Rafferty C"", 'Kelly J', 'Storey L', 'Ryan C', ""O'Marcaigh A"", 'Smith O']","[""Department of Haematology, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin 12, Ireland. orafferc@gmail.com."", ""National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin 12, Ireland.

To find additional somatic abnormalities in aCML, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 15 aCML cases. In 2 cases (13.3%), we identified somatic missense mutations in the ETNK1 gene. Targeted resequencing on 515 hematological clonal disorders revealed the presence of ETNK1 variants in 6 (8.8%) of 68 aCML and 2 (2.6%) of 77 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia samples. These mutations clustered in a small region of the kinase domain, encoding for H243Y and N244S (1/8 H243Y; 7/8 N244S). They were all heterozygous and present in the dominant clone. The intracellular phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine ratio was, on average, 5.2-fold lower in ETNK1-mutated samples (P < .05). Similar results were obtained using myeloid TF1 cells transduced with ETNK1 wild type, ETNK1-N244S, and ETNK1-H243Y, where the intracellular phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine ratio was significantly lower in ETNK1-N244S (0.76 +/- 0.07) and ETNK1-H243Y (0.37 +/- 0.02) than in ETNK1-WT (1.37 +/- 0.32; P = .01 and P = .0008, respectively), suggesting that ETNK1 mutations may inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

However, it also poses a major impediment to tumor immunity since tumors are derived from self-tissue and often induce T cell tolerance and dysfunction. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate T cell tolerance versus immunity has important implications for human health. Signals received from the tissue environment largely dictate whether responding T cells become activated or tolerant. For example, induced expression and subsequent ligation of negative regulatory receptors on the surface of self-reactive CD8(+) T cells are integral in the induction of tolerance. We utilized a murine model of T cell tolerance to more completely define the molecules involved in this process. We discovered that, in addition to other known regulatory receptors, tolerant self-reactive CD8(+) T cells distinctly expressed the surface receptor neuropilin-1 (Nrp1). Nrp1 was highly induced in response to self-antigen, but only modestly when the same antigen was encountered under immune conditions, suggesting a possible mechanistic link to T cell tolerance. We also observed a similar Nrp1 expression profile on human tumor infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Despite high expression on tolerant CD8(+) T cells, our studies revealed that Nrp1 had no detectable role in the tolerant phenotype. Specifically, Nrp1-deficient T cells displayed the same functional defects as wild-type self-reactive T cells, lacking in vivo cytolytic potential, IFNgamma production, and antitumor responses. While reporting mostly negative data, our findings have therapeutic implications, as Nrp1 is now being targeted for human cancer therapy in clinical trials, but the precise molecular pathways and immune cells being engaged during treatment remain incompletely defined.","['Jackson, Stephanie R', 'Berrien-Elliott, Melissa', 'Yuan, Jinyun', 'Hsueh, Eddy C', 'Teague, Ryan M']","['Jackson SR', 'Berrien-Elliott M', 'Yuan J', 'Hsueh EC', 'Teague RM']","['Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Department of Surgery, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America; Saint Louis University Cancer Center, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America; Saint Louis University Cancer Center, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141024,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cross-Priming/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neuropilin-1/*metabolism', 'Phenotype']",2014/10/25 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2014/10/25 06:00'],"['2014/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0110707 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-35384 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 24;9(10):e110707. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0110707. eCollection 2014.,,,"['F30 CA180375/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI087764/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI087764/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F30CA180375/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4208794,,,,,['GEO/GSE58722'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The live T. vaginalis and the T. vaginalis ESP induced the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and the cleavage of PARP. Additionally, the live T. vaginalis, but not the T. vaginalis lysate, induced the cleavage of the proapoptotic Bim protein. The live T. vaginalis and the T. vaginalis ESP, but not the T. vaginalis lysate, induced the dose-dependent cleavage of the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 proteins and decreased the association levels of Bcl-xL/Bim and Mcl-1/Bim complexes. We performed gelatin zymography and casein-hydrolysis assays on the live T. vaginalis and the T. vaginalis ESP to identify the apoptosis-inducing factor. Both the live T. vaginalis and the ESP contained high levels of metalloproteinases, of which activities were significantly inhibited by 1,10-PT treatment. Furthermore, the 1,10-PT blocked the cleavage of Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9, as well as the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and it significantly increased the association levels of the Bcl-xL/Bim and Mcl-1/Bim protein complexes, returning them to normal levels. Our results demonstrate that T. vaginalis induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in SiHa cells through the dissociation of Bcl-xL/Bim and Mcl-1/Bim complexes and that the apoptosis is blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-PT. These results expand our understanding of the role of metalloproteinases in T. vaginalis-induced apoptosis and the signaling pathway in trichomoniasis of the cervicovaginal epithelial cells.","['Quan, Juan-Hua', 'Kang, Byung-Hun', 'Cha, Guang-Ho', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Koh, Young-Bok', 'Yang, Jung-Bo', 'Yoo, Heon-Jong', 'Lee, Min-A', 'Ryu, Jae-Sook', 'Noh, Heung-Tae', 'Kwon, Jaeyul', 'Lee, Young-Ha']","['Quan JH', 'Kang BH', 'Cha GH', 'Zhou W', 'Koh YB', 'Yang JB', 'Yoo HJ', 'Lee MA', 'Ryu JS', 'Noh HT', 'Kwon J', 'Lee YH']","['Department of Gastroenterology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Environmental Biology and Medical Parasitology, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Education, Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141024,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Protozoan)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Protozoan/immunology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Metalloproteases/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Parasites/drug effects/physiology', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Trichomonas vaginalis/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",2014/10/25 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2014/10/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0110659 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-00024 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 24;9(10):e110659. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0110659. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4208800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several risk and genetic factors (AML-related genes) have been investigated, the concrete mechanism underlying the development of AML remains unclear. In view of this, it is crucial to develop an effective computational method for meaningfully characterizing AML genes and accurately predicting novel AML genes. METHODS: In this study, we integrated gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations as features to characterize AML genes. We also provided an optimal set of features for predicting AML-related genes by using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm and dagging metaclassifier. RESULTS: We obtained 26 optimal GO terms that characterized AML genes well. Finally, we predicted 464 novel genes to provide clinical researchers with additional candidates and useful insights for further analysis of AML. DISCUSSION: An in-depth feature analysis indicated that the results are quite consistent with previous knowledge. We developed a systematic method to identify the possible underlying mechanism of AML by analyzing the related genes. Our method has the ability to identify the types of features that are optimal to meaningfully interpret AML and accurately predict more AML genes for further clinical researches.","['Chen, Jing', 'Li, Chao', 'Zhu, Yingchao', 'Sun, Ling', 'Sun, Hui', 'Liu, Yanfang', 'Zhang, Zhenxiang', 'Wang, Chong']","['Chen J', 'Li C', 'Zhu Y', 'Sun L', 'Sun H', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141024,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Computational Biology', '*Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation/*methods']",2014/10/25 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2014/10/25 06:00'],"['2014/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000209 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Jul;20(6):336-42. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000209.

This is probably related to immunosuppression due to chemotherapy, down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules, and the lack of co-stimulatory molecules on dendritic cells (DC). In light of this problem, some methods had been used to induce leukemia cells to differentiate into mature DCs, causing them to present leukemia-associated antigens and activating naive T cells. Furthermore, leukemia-derived DCs could be modified with tumor antigens or tumor-associated antigens to provide a new approach to anti-leukemia therapy. Numerous studies have indicated factors related to the induction and functioning of leukemia-derived DCs and the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). These include the amount of purified DCs, cytokine profiles appropriate for inducing leukemia-derived DCs, effective methods of activating CTLs, reasonable approaches to DC vaccines, and the standardization of their clinical use. Determining these factors could lead to more effective leukemia treatment and benefit both mankind and scientific development.

We describe a novel role for CDK6 in hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells [HSCs] and leukemic stem cells [LSCs]) that exceeds its function as a cell-cycle regulator. Although hematopoiesis appears normal under steady-state conditions, Cdk6(-/-) HSCs do not efficiently repopulate upon competitive transplantation, and Cdk6-deficient mice are significantly more susceptible to 5-fluorouracil treatment. We find that activation of HSCs requires CDK6, which interferes with the transcription of key regulators, including Egr1. Transcriptional profiling of HSCs is consistent with the central role of Egr1. The impaired repopulation capacity extends to BCR-ABL(p210+) LSCs. Transplantation with BCR-ABL(p210+)-infected bone marrow from Cdk6(-/-) mice fails to induce disease, although recipient mice do harbor LSCs. Egr1 knock-down in Cdk6(-/-) BCR-ABL(p210+) LSKs significantly enhances the potential to form colonies, underlining the importance of the CDK6-Egr1 axis.

Two prospective cohort studies published after the report found inconsistent results for estimated aspartame intake, artificially sweetened beverage consumption, and risk of lymphoid neoplasms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine associations of artificially and sugar-sweetened carbonated beverage consumption (for comparison) and aspartame intake with risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) overall and by major histologic subtype in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort. METHODS: Among 100,442 adult men and women who provided information on diet and lifestyle factors in 1999, 1196 NHL cases were verified during a 10-y follow-up period. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted RRs and 95% CIs. RESULTS: In women and men combined, there were no associations of consumption of >/=1 (355 mL) servings/d of artificially (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.17; P-trend: 0.14) or sugar- (RR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.58; P-trend: 0.62) sweetened carbonated beverages with NHL risk, compared to no consumption (P-heterogeneity by gender: 0.11-1.00). Similarly, aspartame intake was not associated with NHL risk (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.24; P-trend: 0.69, top vs. bottom quintile). Associations with NHL subtype (multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and follicular and other B-cell lymphoma) were generally null.

To clarify the effects of MTHFR polymorphisms on the risk of ALL, a meta-analysis was performed in a Chinese population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computerized literature search was carried out in PubMed, the Chinese Biomedicine (CBM) database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) platform, and the Wanfang database (Chinese) to collect relevant articles. RESULTS: A total of 11 articles including 1,738 ALL cases and 2,438 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, a significantly decreased association was found between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and ALL risk when all studies in Chinese populations were pooled into the meta-analysis. In subgroup analyses stratified by age, ethnicity, and source of controls, the same results were observed in children, in population-based studies, and in people with no stated ethnicity. However, a significantly increased association was also found for MTHFR C677T in hospital-based studies, and for MTHFR A1298C in people with no stated ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms may be potential biomarkers for ALL risk in Chinese populations, and studies with a larger sample size and wider population spectrum are required before definitive conclusions can be drawn.","['Xiao, Yi', 'Deng, Tao-Ran', 'Su, Chang-Liang', 'Shang, Zhen']","['Xiao Y', 'Deng TR', 'Su CL', 'Shang Z']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140916,Netherlands,Oncol Res Treat,Oncology research and treatment,101627692,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*ethnology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*ethnology/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/25 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/10/25 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['000368104 [pii]', '10.1159/000368104 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Res Treat. 2014;37(10):576-82. doi: 10.1159/000368104.

The anti-tumor effects of 13-AC were determined by MTT assay, colony formation assessment, cell wound-healing assay, TUNEL/4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. 13-AC inhibited the growth and migration of gastric carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner and induced both early and late apoptosis as assessed by flow cytometer analysis. 13-AC-induced apoptosis was confirmed through observation of a change in DeltaPsim, up-regulated expression levels of Bax and Bad proteins, down-regulated expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 proteins, and the activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, p38 and JNK. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 and JNK activity by pretreatment with SB03580 (a p38-specific inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK-specific inhibitor) led to rescue of the cell cytotoxicity of 13-AC-treated AGS cells, indicating that the p38 and the JNK pathways are also involved in the 13-AC-induced cell apoptosis. Together, these results suggest that 13-AC induces cell apoptosis against gastric cancer cells through triggering of the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway as well as activation of the p38 and JNK pathways.","['Su, Ching-Chyuan', 'Chen, Jeff Yi-Fu', 'Din, Zhong-Hao', 'Su, Jui-Hsin', 'Yang, Zih-Yan', 'Chen, Yi-Jen', 'Wang, Robert Y L', 'Wu, Yu-Jen']","['Su CC', 'Chen JY', 'Din ZH', 'Su JH', 'Yang ZY', 'Chen YJ', 'Wang RY', 'Wu YJ']","['Antai Medical Care Cooperation Antai Tian-Sheng Memorial Hospital, Pingtung 92842, Taiwan. a081001@mail.tsmh.org.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. yifuc@kmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Applied Healthy and Biotechnology, Meiho University, Pingtung 91202, Taiwan. nmm10023@yahoo.com.tw.', 'National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, Pingtung 94446, Taiwan. x2219@nmmba.gov.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Food Science, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung 91202, Taiwan. vian10045@gmail.com.', 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. chernkmu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan. yuwang@mail.cgu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Beauty Science, Meiho University, Pingtung 91202, Taiwan. wyr924@ms24.hinet.net.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (13-acetoxysarcocrassolide)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2014/10/25 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2014/10/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['md12105295 [pii]', '10.3390/md12105295 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2014 Oct 23;12(10):5295-315. doi: 10.3390/md12105295.,,,,PMC4210900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Review of the medical profiles of 36,930 patients admitted to our hospital between 2003 and 2013 yielded a total of 86 cases of cardiac tumors (63 cases of myxomas and 23 cases of non-myxoma tumors). Clinical presentations and histological features were presented exclusively for primary and secondary tumors. RESULTS: Of 23 enrolled patients with non-myxoma tumors, 5 had primary tumors and 18 had secondary or metastatic tumors. The most frequent origins of the secondary tumors were breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia and lung cancer. Most secondary tumors had pericardial involvement, and only one tumor involved the left atrium. Sarcomas, including spindle-cell sarcoma and liposarcoma, comprised the majority of the primary malignant tumors. None of these tumors had pericardial involvement, and, except for one case, all were confined to the left side of the heart. All patients were symptomatic on admission, with dyspnea being the most frequent presenting symptom.

In certain cases, their expression levels are positively correlated with poor clinical outcome. A number of selective Pim kinase inhibitors are under development and a few are in clinical trials. Investigations of the mechanism of actions of these drugs have demonstrated that by inhibiting Pim kinases, processes such as transcription, translation, cell cycle progression, cell survival and drug resistance are affected. Pim kinases can be upregulated by multiple growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which also activate redundant pathways such as phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B/mammalian targets of rapamycin, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Interestingly, Pim kinases also share substrates with these parallel pathways. To overcome this challenge, Pim kinase inhibitors were tested in combination with other therapeutic agents based on their unique mechanism of actions. Based on existing literature, we identified studies where Pim kinase inhibitors were part of the combination strategies that used targeted agents or broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic drugs (including FDA-approved agents). The addition of Pim kinase inhibitors to these treatment strategies leads to additive to synergistic cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. Depending on the compound, combination results in sequential or complementary blockage or downregulation of oncogenic pathway. In summary, these studies provide evidence for developing mechanism-based combination therapies with Pim kinase inhibitors to treat cancers.","['Yang, Qingshan', 'Chen, Lisa S', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Yang Q', 'Chen LS', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Unit 1950, P.O.

Nonetheless, most patients tend to relapse, underlining the need for new therapeutic approaches. The anti-leukemic potential of natural killer (NK) cells has over the years raised considerable interest. In this study, we developed an efficient method for the expansion and activation of NK cells isolated from healthy donors and ALL patients for clinical use. NK cell products were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 35 healthy donors and 4 B-lineage ALL by immunomagnetic CD3 T cell depletion followed by CD56 cell enrichment. Isolated NK cells were expanded and stimulated in serum-free medium supplemented with irradiated autologous feeder cells and autologous plasma in the presence of clinical grade interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15 for 14 days. Healthy donor NK cells expanded on average 34.9 +/- 10.4 fold and were represented, after expansion, by a highly pure population of CD3(-)CD56(+) cells showing a significant upregulation of natural cytotoxicity receptors, activating receptors and maturation markers. These expanded effectors showed cytolytic activity against K562 cells and, most importantly, against primary adult B-lineage ALL blasts. NK cells could be efficiently isolated and expanded-on average 39.5 +/- 20.3 fold-also from primary B-lineage ALL samples of patients in complete remission. The expanded NK cells from these patients showed a significantly increased expression of the NKG2D- and DNAM1-activating receptors and were cytotoxic against K562 cells. These data provide the basis for developing new immunotherapeutic strategies for the management of ALL patients.","['Peragine, Nadia', 'Torelli, Giovanni F', 'Mariglia, Paola', 'Pauselli, Simona', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Peragine N', 'Torelli GF', 'Mariglia P', 'Pauselli S', 'Vitale A', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141024,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*metabolism/therapy']",2014/10/25 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2014/10/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-014-1614-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2015 Feb;64(2):201-11. doi: 10.1007/s00262-014-1614-z.

HTLV-1 Tax is a trans-activating protein that regulates viral gene expression and also modulates cellular signaling pathways to enhance T-cell proliferation and cell survival. The Tax oncoprotein promotes T-cell transformation, in part via constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Ubiquitination is a type of post-translational modification that occurs in a three-step enzymatic cascade mediated by E1, E2 and E3 enzymes and regulates protein stability as well as signal transduction, protein trafficking and the DNA damage response. Emerging studies indicate that Tax hijacks the ubiquitin machinery to activate ubiquitin-dependent kinases and downstream NF-kappaB signaling. Tax interacts with the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and is conjugated on C-terminal lysine residues with lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Tax K63-linked polyubiquitination may serve as a platform for signaling complexes since this modification is critical for interactions with NEMO and IKK.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of maternal inflammation, induced by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 45 microg/kg) on embryonic day 11.5 (E 11.5), on the development of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) system in mouse fetuses as well as on the proinflammatory cytokine level in pregnant mice and their fetuses. In the fetuses, the GnRH neuron migration from the olfactory pit to the forebrain was estimated on embryonic days 14.5 and 18.5. The levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were measured with the cytometric bead and ELISA array method in the maternal and fetal blood, amniotic fluid and fetal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). According to our data, activation of the immune system by LPS treatment on embryonic day 11.5 leads to an increased quantity of neurons in the nasal and olfactory bulb areas and a decreased quantity in the forebrain area on embryonic day 14.5. There was a slight decrease in the total number of neurons in the forebrain area on embryonic day 18.5. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased within 3 h after LPS treatment in the maternal and fetal blood, amniotic fluid and fetal CSF. IL-6-receptor immunoreactivity was detected on olfactory/vomeronasal axons. Thus, prenatal immunological stress delays the GnRH neuron migration in the nasal compartment of mouse fetuses, which may be mediated by the regulation of IL-6, MCP-1 and LIF secretion in the maternal-fetal system.","['Sharova, Victoria S', 'Izvolskaia, Marina S', 'Zakharova, Liudmila A']","['Sharova VS', 'Izvolskaia MS', 'Zakharova LA']","['Koltsov Institute of Developmental Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141021,Switzerland,Neuroimmunomodulation,Neuroimmunomodulation,9422763,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus/metabolism', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*metabolism', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Pregnancy']",2014/10/25 06:00,2016/03/30 06:00,['2014/10/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['000365482 [pii]', '10.1159/000365482 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroimmunomodulation. 2015;22(4):222-32. doi: 10.1159/000365482.

We delineated the sites of the inhibitor for modification, guided by crystal structures of dCK in complex with the lead compound and with derivatives. Crystal structure of the complex between dCK and the racemic mixture of our new lead compound indicated that the R-isomer is responsible for kinase inhibition. This was corroborated by kinetic analysis of the purified enantiomers, which showed that the R-isomer has >60-fold higher affinity than the S-isomer for dCK.

Recently, the latexin (Lxn) gene was identified as a potential tumor suppressor in several types of solid tumors and lymphoma, and Lxn expression was found to be absent or downregulated in leukemic cells. Whether Lxn functions as a tumor suppressor in leukemia and what molecular and cellular mechanisms are involved are unknown. In this study, the myeloid leukemogenic FDC-P1 cell line was used as a model system and Lxn was ectopically expressed in these cells. Using the protein pull-down assay and mass spectrometry, ribosomal protein subunit 3 (Rps3) was identified as a novel Lxn binding protein. Ectopic expression of Lxn inhibited FDC-P1 growth in vitro. More surprisingly, Lxn enhanced gamma irradiation-induced DNA damages and induced cell-cycle arrest and massive necrosis, leading to depletion of FDC-P1 cells. Mechanistically, Lxn inhibited the nuclear translocation of Rps3 upon radiation, resulting in abnormal mitotic spindle formation and chromosome instability. Rps3 knockdown increased the radiation sensitivity of FDC-P1, confirming that the mechanism of action of Lxn is mediated by Rps3 pathway. Moreover, Lxn enhanced the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agent, VP-16, on FDC-P1 cells. Our study suggests that Lxn itself not only suppresses leukemic cell growth but also potentiates the cytotoxic effect of radio- and chemotherapy on cancer cells. Lxn could be a novel molecular target that improves the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy.","['You, Y', 'Wen, R', 'Pathak, R', 'Li, A', 'Li, W', 'St Clair, D', 'Hauer-Jensen, M', 'Zhou, D', 'Liang, Y']","['You Y', 'Wen R', 'Pathak R', 'Li A', 'Li W', 'St Clair D', 'Hauer-Jensen M', 'Zhou D', 'Liang Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.', 'Gratuate Center for Toxicology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA [2] Gratuate Center for Toxicology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Lxn protein, rat)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (ribosomal protein 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*radiation effects', 'Cell Death/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Chromosomal Instability/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', '*Gamma Rays', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Binding/radiation effects', 'Protein Transport/radiation effects', 'Radiation Tolerance/radiation effects', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*radiation effects', 'Spindle Apparatus/radiation effects', 'Stress, Physiological/radiation effects']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014443 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.443 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 23;5:e1493. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.443.,,,"['UL1 TR000117/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2TR000116/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA177558-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR000116/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA177558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 RR033171/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4237263,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

General histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been used in blood cancers including AML, but the lack of gene specificity greatly limits their anti-cancer effects and clinical applications. Here, we found that HDAC1 expression was negatively correlated with that of Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and that AML patients with lower HDAC1 level had better prognosis. Further, knockdown of HDAC1 in leukemia cells K562, HL-60, and U937 significantly increased Klf4 expression and inhibited cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, similar results were found for HDAC inhibitors (VPA and mocetinostat). Moreover, overexpression or knockdown of Klf4 could markedly block the effects of HDAC1 overexpression or knockdown on leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that HDAC1 and Klf4 competitively bound to the promoter region of Klf4 and oppositely regulated Klf4 expression in myeloid leukemia. We identified HDAC1 as a potential specific target for repressing cell proliferation and inducing cell cycle arrest through interplay and modulation of Klf4 expression, suggests that HDAC1 and Klf4 are potential new molecular markers and targets for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of myeloid leukemia.","['Huang, Y', 'Chen, J', 'Lu, C', 'Han, J', 'Wang, G', 'Song, C', 'Zhu, S', 'Wang, C', 'Li, G', 'Kang, J', 'Wang, J']","['Huang Y', 'Chen J', 'Lu C', 'Han J', 'Wang G', 'Song C', 'Zhu S', 'Wang C', 'Li G', 'Kang J', 'Wang J']","['Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Health Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'Laboratory of Population & Quantitative Genetics, Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Health Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Health Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Health Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Health Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Health Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Health Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014433 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.433 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 23;5:e1491. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.433.,,,,PMC4237257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report the physiological significance of an interaction between Mcl-1 and the mitochondrial outer membrane-localized voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in NSCLC cell lines. Mcl-1 bound with high affinity to VDAC1 and 3 isoforms but only very weakly to VDAC2 and binding was disrupted by peptides based on the VDAC1 sequence. In A549 cells, reducing Mcl-1 expression levels or application of VDAC-based peptides limited Ca(2+) uptake into the mitochondrial matrix, the consequence of which was to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In A549, H1299 and H460 cells, both Mcl-1 knockdown and VDAC-based peptides attenuated cell migration without affecting cell proliferation. Migration was rescued in Mcl-1 knockdown cells by experimentally restoring ROS levels, consistent with a model in which ROS production drives increased migration. These data suggest that an interaction between Mcl-1 and VDAC promotes lung cancer cell migration by a mechanism that involves Ca(2+)-dependent ROS production.","['Huang, H', 'Shah, K', 'Bradbury, N A', 'Li, C', 'White, C']","['Huang H', 'Shah K', 'Bradbury NA', 'Li C', 'White C']","['Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine & Science, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine & Science, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine & Science, North Chicago, IL, USA.', '1] Molecular Targets Program, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Medicine, Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine & Science, North Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014419 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.419 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 23;5:e1482. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.419.,,,"['K01 CA106599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA175003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA175003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4237246,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the maturity of microarray/sequencing technologies, large amounts of data measuring the genome-wide signals of those factors became available from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, there is a lack of an integrative model to take full advantage of these rich yet heterogeneous data. To this end, we developed RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation), which fits the mRNA expression as response using as explanatory variables, the TF data from ENCODE, and CNV, DM, miRNA expression signals from TCGA. Briefly, RACER first infers the sample-specific regulatory activities by TFs and miRNAs, which are then used as inputs to infer specific TF/miRNA-gene interactions. Such a two-stage regression framework circumvents a common difficulty in integrating ENCODE data measured in generic cell-line with the sample-specific TCGA measurements. As a case study, we integrated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) data from TCGA and the related TF binding data measured in K562 from ENCODE. As a proof-of-concept, we first verified our model formalism by 10-fold cross-validation on predicting gene expression. We next evaluated RACER on recovering known regulatory interactions, and demonstrated its superior statistical power over existing methods in detecting known miRNA/TF targets. Additionally, we developed a feature selection procedure, which identified 18 regulators, whose activities clustered consistently with cytogenetic risk groups. One of the selected regulators is miR-548p, whose inferred targets were significantly enriched for leukemia-related pathway, implicating its novel role in AML pathogenesis. Moreover, survival analysis using the inferred activities identified C-Fos as a potential AML prognostic marker. Together, we provided a novel framework that successfully integrated the TCGA and ENCODE data in revealing AML-specific regulatory program at global level.","['Li, Yue', 'Liang, Minggao', 'Zhang, Zhaolei']","['Li Y', 'Liang M', 'Zhang Z']","['Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Banting and Best Department of Medical Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Regression Analysis']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003908 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-14-00501 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2014 Oct 23;10(10):e1003908. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003908. eCollection 2014 Oct.,,,,PMC4207489,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using mass spectrometry, we undertook an unbiased proteome-wide quantitative survey of cellular proteins modified by ubiquitin in the presence of Tax or a Tax mutant impaired in IKK activation. Tax induced the ubiquitination of 22 cellular proteins, including the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member MCL-1, in an IKK-dependent manner. Tax was found to promote the nondegradative lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of MCL-1 that was dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and the IKK complex. Tax interacted with and activated TRAF6, and triggered its mitochondrial localization, where it conjugated four carboxyl-terminal lysine residues of MCL-1 with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which stabilized and protected MCL-1 from genotoxic stress-induced degradation. TRAF6 and MCL-1 played essential roles in the survival of HTLV-1 transformed cells and the immortalization of primary T cells by HTLV-1. Therefore, K63-linked polyubiquitination represents a novel regulatory mechanism controlling MCL-1 stability that has been usurped by a viral oncogene to precipitate cell survival and transformation.","['Choi, Young Bong', 'Harhaj, Edward William']","['Choi YB', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141023,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '120904-94-1 (Polyubiquitin)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Polyubiquitin/metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6/*metabolism']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004458 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-00654 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2014 Oct 23;10(10):e1004458. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004458. eCollection 2014 Oct.,,,"['R01 CA135362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA135362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4207805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates the influence of pretransplant weight loss and serologic indicators of nutritional homeostasis on relapse and death of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after alloSCT. METHODS: Pretransplant weight loss along with serum levels of total serum protein (TSP), albumin, C-reactive protein, and leptin were collected retrospectively in a training cohort (n = 149) and correlated with clinical outcome. Metabolic risk groups were defined and tested in an independent validation cohort (n = 167). RESULTS: We identified pretransplant weight loss and TSP as strong independent predictors of relapse and death. Patients in the metabolic high-risk group (low TSP and weight loss) had an increased risk for relapse (P = 0.0002) and death (P = 0.002), but a similar risk for acute graft-versus-host disease. Weight loss coincided with reduced pretransplant serum leptin levels. The adverse influence of weight loss and high metabolic risk on relapse and overall survival could be confirmed in the validation cohort and similarly in patients with less than or more than 5% blasts before alloSCT. Multivariate analysis of both cohorts revealed a hazard ratio for relapse of 7.78 (2.59-23.36, P = 0.0003) in the metabolic high risk group. CONCLUSION: Altered nutritional homeostasis before alloSCT correlates with recurrence of AML after transplantation. Studies addressing pretransplant nutritional interventions to reduce AML relapse rates are warranted.","['Dietrich, Sascha', 'Radujkovic, Aleksandar', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Falk, Christine S', 'Benner, Axel', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Luft, Thomas']","['Dietrich S', 'Radujkovic A', 'Stolzel F', 'Falk CS', 'Benner A', 'Schaich M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Kramer A', 'Hegenbart U', 'Ho AD', 'Dreger P', 'Luft T']","['1 Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. 2 Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, Technical University Dresden, Germany. 3 Institute of Transplant Immunology, IFB-Tx, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. 4 Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Leptin)']",IM,"['Blood Proteins/analysis', 'Body Mass Index', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leptin/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/mortality/therapy', '*Nutritional Status', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Weight Loss']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/TP.0000000000000471 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2015 May;99(5):1065-71. doi: 10.1097/TP.0000000000000471.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 cytokines bind to their specific receptors and activate glycoprotein 130 (gp130), a common receptor, followed by further activation of STAT3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 through janus kinases (JAKs); however the importance of glycosylation of gp130 remains to be elucidated in cardiac myocytes. In this study, we examined the biological significance of gp130 glycosylation using tunicamycin (Tm), an inhibitor of enzyme involved in N-linked glycosylation. In cardiomyocytes, the treatment with Tm completely replaced the glycosylated form of gp130 with its unglycosylated one. Tm treatment inhibited leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-mediated activation of STAT3 and ERK1/2. Similarly, IL-11 failed to activate STAT3 and ERK1/2 in the presence of Tm. Interestingly, Tm inhibited the activation of JAKs 1 and 2, without influencing the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalings (SOCSs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), which are endogenous inhibitors of JAKs. To exclude the possibility that Tm blocks LIF and IL-11 signals by inhibiting the glycosylation of their specific receptors, we investigated whether the stimulation with IL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) could transduce their signals in Tm-treated cardiomyocytes and found that this stimulation was unable to activate the downstream signals. Collectively, these findings indicate that glycosylation of gp130 is essential for signal transduction of IL-6 family cytokines in cardiomyocytes.","['Matsuo, Reo', 'Morihara, Hirofumi', 'Mohri, Tomomi', 'Murasawa, Shiho', 'Takewaki, Kana', 'Nakayama, Hiroyuki', 'Maeda, Makiko', 'Fujio, Yasushi']","['Matsuo R', 'Morihara H', 'Mohri T', 'Murasawa S', 'Takewaki K', 'Nakayama H', 'Maeda M', 'Fujio Y']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Interleukin-6/*chemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/chemistry', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tunicamycin/*chemistry']",2014/10/24 06:00,2016/01/14 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0111097 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-15824 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 23;9(10):e111097. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111097. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4207791,,,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2015;10(3):e0122930.

Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia, with advantages over the prototype imatinib in terms of potency and selectivity towards BCR-ABL, and the DDR, PDGFR, and KIT receptor kinases. In this study, we compared efficacies of the two drugs on cultured cells of PNF in vitro and on xenografted tumor fragments on sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice. Xenografts were monitored weekly using a high resolution ultrasound measurement. Treatment with nilotinib at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg for four weeks led to a reduction of the graft sizesstd by 68+/-7% in the 8 treated mice, significantly more than the 33+/-8% reduction in the 8 untreated mice (P<0.05) and the 47+/-15% in the 7 mice treated with imatinib (P<0.05). The peak plasma nilotinib concentration 6.6+/-1.1 microM is within the pharmacological range of clinical application. Imatinib, but not nilotinib significantly hindered body weight increase of the mice and elevated cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells (P<0.05).

The HTLV-1 Tax protein functions as a potent viral oncogene that constitutively activates the NF-kappaB transcription factor to transform T cells; however, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, using next-generation RNA sequencing we identified the IL-25 receptor subunit IL-17RB as an aberrantly overexpressed gene in HTLV-1 immortalized T cells. Tax induced the expression of IL-17RB in an IkappaB kinase (IKK) and NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Remarkably, Tax activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway in T cells was critically dependent on IL-17RB expression. IL-17RB and IL-25 were required for HTLV-1-induced immortalization of primary T cells, and the constitutive NF-kappaB activation and survival of HTLV-1 transformed T cells. IL-9 was identified as an important downstream target gene of the IL-17RB pathway that drives the proliferation of HTLV-1 transformed cells. Furthermore, IL-17RB was overexpressed in leukemic cells from a subset of ATL patients and also regulated NF-kappaB activation in some, but not all, Tax-negative ATL cell lines.

This study found that the expression level of GLUT1 in virus-producing 293T cells was inversely correlated with HTLV-1 Env-mediated fusion activity and infectivity. Chimeric studies between GLUT1 and GLUT3 indicated that the extracellular loop 6 (ECL6) of GLUT1 is important for the inhibition of cell-cell fusion mediated by Env. When GLUT1 was translocated into the plasma membrane from intracellular storage sites by bafilomycin A1 (BFLA1) treatment in 293T cells, HTLV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and infection also were inhibited without the overexpression of GLUT1, indicating that the localization of GLUT1 in intracellular compartments rather than in the plasma membrane is crucial for the fusion activity of HTLV-1 Env. Immunoprecipitation and laser scanning confocal microscopic analyses indicated that under normal conditions, HTLV-1 Env and GLUT1 do not colocalize or interact. BFLA1 treatment induced this colocalization and interaction, indicating that GLUT1 normally accumulates in intracellular compartments separate from that of Env. Western blot analyses of FLAG-tagged HTLV-1 Env in virus-producing cells and the incorporation of HTLV-1 Env in virus-like particles (VLPs) indicate that the processing of Env is inhibited by either overexpression of GLUT1 or BFLA1 treatment in virus-producing 293T cells. This inhibition probably is due to the interaction of the Env with GLUT1 in intracellular compartments. Taken together, separate intracellular localizations of GLUT1 and HTLV-1 Env are required for the fusion activity and infectivity of HTLV-1 Env. IMPORTANCE: The deltaretrovirus HTLV-1 is a causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Although HTLV-1 is a complex retrovirus that has accessory genes, no HTLV-1 gene product has yet been shown to regulate its receptor GLUT1 in virus-producing cells. In this study, we found that a large amount of GLUT1 or translocation of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane from intracellular compartments in virus-producing cells enhances the colocalization and interaction of GLUT1 with HTLV-1 Env, leading to the inhibition of cell fusion activity and infectivity. The results of our study suggest that GLUT1 normally accumulates in separate intracellular compartments from Env, which is indeed required for the proper processing of Env.","['Maeda, Yosuke', 'Terasawa, Hiromi', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Mitsuura, Chisho', 'Nakashima, Kaori', 'Yusa, Keisuke', 'Harada, Shinji']","['Maeda Y', 'Terasawa H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Mitsuura C', 'Nakashima K', 'Yusa K', 'Harada S']","['Department of Medical Virology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan ymaeda@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Medical Virology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Virology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Virology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Biological Chemistry and Biologicals, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Virology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141022,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/*analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lymphocytes/*chemistry/*virology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*analysis', '*Virus Internalization']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02686-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02686-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Jan;89(1):502-11. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02686-14.

Furthermore, the predictive role of cytogenetics on venous thromboembolism (VTE) has largely been ignored. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and prognostic aspects of VTE in AML. A total of 811 consecutive patients with AML were enrolled and analysed retrospectively. Cox time-dependent covariate regression analysis was used to identify the significant predictors of VTE development. To minimise potential confounding factors, we used propensity-score matching to compare overall survival between patients with and without VTE. The six-month and one-year cumulative incidences of VTE were 3.1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 2.0-4.7) and 3.9 % (95 % CI, 2.6-5.7), respectively. Of the 26 cases of VTE, 22 (85 %) developed within 6 months of leukemia diagnosis and 13 (50 %) were catheter-related. In multivariate analysis, advanced age (>/= 65 years) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.70; p = 0.03) and increasing cytogenetic risk (common HR, 1.84; p = 0.05) were independent predictors of VTE. There was no significant association between VTE development and decreased survival (p = 0.32 for matched analysis). Advanced age and increasing cytogenetic risk, well-known predictors for clinical outcome in AML, were also independent risk factors of VTE development. Our results suggest that VTE does not hold prognostic implications for AML.","['Lee, Yun-Gyoo', 'Kim, Inho', 'Kwon, Ji-hyun', 'Yoon, Sung Soo', 'Park, Seongyang', 'Song, Leo', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Lee YG', 'Kim I', 'Kwon JH', 'Yoon SS', 'Park S', 'Song L', 'Yoon JH', 'Shin SH', 'Min WS', 'Kim HJ']","['Seongyang Park, M D, PhD, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul 110-744, Korea, Tel.: +82 2 2072 3347; Fax: +82 2 762 9662, E-mail: seonpark@snu.ac.kr.', ""Hee-Je, Kim, MD, PhD, Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Institute, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 505 Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul 137-070, Korea, Tel.: +82 2 2258 6054; Fax: +82 2 599 3589, E-mail: cumckim@catholic.ac.kr.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20141023,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Propensity Score', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Venous Thromboembolism/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['13-12-1020 [pii]', '10.1160/TH13-12-1020 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2015 Jan;113(1):201-8. doi: 10.1160/TH13-12-1020.

Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has been found to possess anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory bioactivities. The present study was performed to examine the effect of quercetin on human leukemic MDR K562/adriamycin (ADR) cells. Treatment of K562/ADR cells with a combination of quercetin and ADR resulted in potentiation of cytotoxicity, which was measured using a cell counting kit-8 assay. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that quercetin dose-dependently promoted cell apoptosis and treatment with a combination of quercetin and ADR caused synergistic enhancement of the apoptotic effect. In addition, treatment of K562/ADR cells with quercetin alone or in combination with ADR resulted in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3, reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-extra large and enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death, Bcl-2-associated death promoter and Bcl-2-associated X protein in the cells. Furthermore, the combined treatment of quercetin and ADR synergistically increased the expression of phosphorylated (p-)c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and decreased the expression of p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the K562/ADR cells. In addition, the expression of P-glycoprotein was significantly decreased following treatment with quercetin alone or in combination with ADR. These findings demonstrated that quercetin is important in MDR and may be developed into a new reversal agent for cancer chemotherapy.","['Chen, Fang-Yuan', 'Cao, Lan-Fang', 'Wan, Hai-Xia', 'Zhang, Min-Yue', 'Cai, Jia-Yi', 'Shen, Li-Jing', 'Zhong, Ji-Hua', 'Zhong, Hua']","['Chen FY', 'Cao LF', 'Wan HX', 'Zhang MY', 'Cai JY', 'Shen LJ', 'Zhong JH', 'Zhong H']","['Department of Hematology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, P.R.

Because of leukemia's heterogeneity, the risk for IFDs is highly variable. We therefore apply a risk-adapted antifungal strategy with strong emphasis on pretreatment and day-15 posttreatment to allow earlier and more individualized interventions. We determine pretreatment risks for IFDs based on 4 factors: (1) host fitness for standard therapy (ie, fit, unfit, or frail); (2) leukemia resistance (high vs low probability of achieving complete remission [CR]); (3) anticipated treatment-related toxicity such as neutropenia, mucositis, and steroid-induced immunosuppression; and (4) patient exposure to opportunistic fungi. Accordingly, we stratify patients as high, intermediate, or low risk for IFDs and apply risk-adapted antifungal strategies, including primary or secondary prophylaxis and diagnostic-based preemptive or empiric therapy. Prevention of IFDs also relies on optimizing organ function, decreasing exposure to opportunistic fungi, and improving net state of immunosuppression with use of better-tolerated and investigational agents for unfit patients and those with adverse leukemia biology. Novel targeted and safe therapies that can achieve higher rates of sustained CR among patients with adverse genetics offer the best promise for reducing the burden of IFDs in these patients.","['Nucci, Marcio', 'Anaissie, Elias']","['Nucci M', 'Anaissie E']","['University Hospital, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141022,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/drug therapy', 'Candidiasis/complications/drug therapy', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Leukemia/*complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39551-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-516211 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 18;124(26):3858-69. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-516211.

METHODS: Both pDC and myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) were isolated and purified from leukemic patient with SR and healthy donor by combination of immunomagnetic beads and flow cytometry. pDC were cultured in RPMI1640 medium and stimulated with different bacteria. The T cells proliferation was detected by MTT, and cytokine production by ELISA kits. RESULTS: The human bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa stimulation for 48 h resulted in the maturation of pDC with production of high quantity of IFN-alpha at (15.34 +/- 2.91) ng/ml and (10.38 +/- 1.41) ng/ml, respectively, comparing with that of negative group at (1.36 +/- 0.13) ng/ml (P<0.01).

METHODS: Adult de novo Ph negative ALL patients in our hospital from Jan 4, 2009 to Sep 4, 2013 were involved in this study and divided into 2 groups according to treatment regimens, the traditional regimen (regimen 1) and modified pediatric regimen (regimen 2) groups, respectively. The safety and the efficacy of all patients and different regimen groups were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: All 144 patients received the induction therapy. The total complete remission (CR) rate was 95.8%, one course CR rate was 92.4%, and 5 year overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (RFS) were 59.0% and 48.6% respectively. The CR rate, 3 year OS and 3 year RFS between the two different regimens were 95.6% vs 96.1% (P = 0.783), 65.3% vs 63.4% (P = 0.885) and 56.0% vs 50.0% (P = 0.931), respectively. Further analysis stratified with age was also performed. For the patients treated with regimen 1, the 3 year OS and RFS between the two different age groups (14-30 years and 31-60 years) was 69.6% vs 54.7% (P = 0.042) and 56.5% vs 57.0% (P = 0.472). For the patients treated with regimen 2, the 3 year OS and RFS between the two different age groups (14-30 years and 31-60 years) was 65.7% vs 60.3% (P = 0.423) and 51.5% vs 46.6% (P = 0.655). No differences were found on the respiratory failure, cardiac dysfunction, fungal infection and intestinal obstruction between the two treatment regimen groups. The incidence of renal dysfunction for regimen 1 was lower than that of regimen 2 (P = 0.011). The incidence of bacteremia for regimen 1 was higher than that of regimen 2 (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: The two treatment regimens for adult Ph negative ALL patients were well tolerated and showed relative favorable CR rate and long term survival rate. The older patients (31-60 years) tended to benefit from the regiment 2 which was less intensive and consisted of more agents with low suppression to bone marrow.","['Zhao, Xingli', 'Wei, Hui', 'Lin, Dong', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhou, Chunlin', 'Liu, Bingcheng', 'Li, Wei', 'Liu, Kaiqi', 'Wang, Huijun', 'Li, Chengwen', 'Li, Qinghua', 'Gong, Benfa', 'Liu, Yuntao', 'Gong, Xiaoyuan', 'Mi, Yingchang', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Zhao X', 'Wei H', 'Lin D', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou C', 'Liu B', 'Li W', 'Liu K', 'Wang H', 'Li C', 'Li Q', 'Gong B', 'Liu Y', 'Gong X', 'Mi Y', 'Wang J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.10.001 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Oct;35(10):873-9. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.10.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic progenitor cells and is the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults. Myeloid and other hematopoietic cell lineages are involved in the process of clonal proliferation and differentiation. In the present study, we aimed to ascertain whether chimeric oncolytic adenovirus-mediated transfer of the human interleukin-24 (IL-24) gene induces enhanced antitumor potency. Our results showed that the Ad5/11 chimeric oncolytic adenovirus carrying hIL-24 (AdCN20511-IL-24) produced high levels of hIL-24 in AML cancer cells, as compared with the Ad5 oncolytic adenovirus expressing hIL-24 (AdCN205-IL-24). AdCN205-11-IL-24 specifically induced a cytotoxic effect on AML cancer cells, but had little or no effect on a normal cell line. AdCN205-11-IL-24 induced higher antitumor activity in AML cancer cells by inducing apoptosis in vitro. This study suggests that transfer of IL-24 by an Ad5/11 chimeric oncolytic adenovirus may be a potent antitumor approach for AML cancer therapy.","['Wei, Xubin', 'Liu, Li', 'Wang, Gang', 'Li, Wei', 'Xu, Ke', 'Qi, Hongyan', 'Liu, Hong', 'Shen, Jing', 'Li, Zhongjie', 'Shao, Jimin']","['Wei X', 'Liu L', 'Wang G', 'Li W', 'Xu K', 'Qi H', 'Liu H', 'Shen J', 'Li Z', 'Shao J']","['Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, P.R.

However, the clinical application of the agent is limited by its cyto- and genotoxic effects on normal cells. Thus, relief of As2 O3 toxicity in normal cells is essentially necessary for improvement of As2 O3 -mediated chemotherapy. In this study, we have identified a series of protective effects of resveratrol against As2 O3 -induced oxidative damage in normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. We showed that treatment of HBE cells with resveratrol significantly reduced cellular levels of DNA damage, chromosomal breakage, and apoptosis induced by As2 O3 . The effect of resveratrol against DNA damage was associated with a decreased level of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in cells treated by As2 O3 , suggesting that resveratrol protects against As2 O3 toxicity via a cellular anti-oxidative stress pathway. Further analysis of the roles of resveratrol demonstrated that it modulated biosynthesis, recycling, and consumption of glutathione (GSH), thereby promoting GSH homeostasis in HBE cells treated by As2 O3 . This was further supported by results showing that resveratrol prevented an increase in the activities and levels of caspases, Fas, Fas-L, and cytochrome c proteins induced by As2 O3 . Our study indicates that resveratrol relieves As2 O3 -induced oxidative damage in normal human lung cells via maintenance of GSH homeostasis and suppression of apoptosis.","['Chen, Chengzhi', 'Jiang, Xuejun', 'Lai, Yanhao', 'Liu, Yuan', 'Zhang, Zunzhen']","['Chen C', 'Jiang X', 'Lai Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang Z']","[""Department of Environmental Health, West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141023,United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Bronchi/cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxins/toxicity', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Protective Agents/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/em.21919 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2015 Apr;56(3):333-46. doi: 10.1002/em.21919.

Incidences of common cancers has been growing in different provinces of Iran in recent years but trends in Khuzestan which shares a border with Iraq and is located in south west of Iran have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess secular changes in incidences of common cancers in Khuzestan province from 2004 to 2008. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected from Khuzestan cancer registry which is a branch of Iranian Ministry of Health Cancer Registry (http://ircancer.ir) for the period 2004-2008. Data were presented as incidence rates by site, sex, age, using the crude rate and age-standardized rate (ASR) per 105 persons. A direct method of standardization was applied according to the WHO guideline and data analysis was performed using the SPSS package. RESULTS: During the 2004-2008 period, 14,893 new cases of cancer were registered in Khuzestan cancer registry. The age- standardized incidence rate of all cancers was 153.7 per 105 in males and 156.4 per 105 in females. The incidence was increased over the period of five years. The most incident cancers among males were skin cancer (ASR =18.7/105), stomach cancer (ASR13.8/105), lung cancer (ASR12.9/105), leukemia (ASR=12.6/105) and prostate cancer (ASR=12.4/105). In females, the most incident cancers were breast cancer (ASR=41/105), skin cancer (ASR=16.4/105), colorectal cancer (ASR=10.0/105), leukemia (ASR=8.1/105) and lung cancer (ASR=6.9/105). CONCLUSIONS: Incidences of various cancers are rising in Khuzestan. It is necessary to develop and implement comprehensive cancer control programs in this region which could be monitored and evaluated by the future trend data from cancer registry.","['Amoori, Neda', 'Mirzaei, Masoud', 'Cheraghi, Maria']","['Amoori N', 'Mirzaei M', 'Cheraghi M']","['Abadan School of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran E-mail : masoud.mirzaei@sydney.edu.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.19.8345 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(19):8345-9. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.19.8345.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown to be involved in various types of cancer. It has at least 6 nuclear isoforms and a cytoplasmic type with different characteristics. Its multiple functions in growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, replicative senescence, inhibition of oncogenic transformation, and suppression of migration and angiogenesis have made it a therapeutic target for cancer therapy.

However, the optimal pH for RNase He1 activity is lower than that of RNase Po1, and the enzyme shows little inhibition of human tumor cell proliferation. Hence, to investigate the potential antitumor activity of recombinant RNase He1 and to possibly enhance its optimum pH, we generated RNase He1 mutants by replacing 12 Asn/Gln residues with Asp/Glu residues; the amino acid sequence of RNase Po1 was taken as reference. These mutants were then expressed in Escherichia coli. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we successfully modified the optimal pH for enzyme activity and generated a recombinant RNase He1 that inhibited the proliferation of cells in the human leukemia cell line. These properties are extremely important in the production of anticancer biologics that are based on RNase activity.","['Kobayashi, Hiroko', 'Motoyoshi, Naomi', 'Itagaki, Tadashi', 'Suzuki, Mamoru', 'Inokuchi, Norio']","['Kobayashi H', 'Motoyoshi N', 'Itagaki T', 'Suzuki M', 'Inokuchi N']","['a Department of Microbiology, School of Pharmacy , Nihon University , Chiba , Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Basidiomycota/*enzymology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Glutamine', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Conformation', 'Ribonucleases/*chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/09168451.2014.972327 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2015;79(2):211-7. doi: 10.1080/09168451.2014.972327.

K562 cells and primary CML-Bp cells were co-cultured with BMMSC of different groups; the cell proliferation was detected by MTT method, the cell apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry, the expression levels of Caspase-8, Caspase-9, and activated Caspase-3 in cells were measured by Western blot. The results showed that the CML-Bp BMMSC could enhance the survival rate of K562 cells treated with adviamycin (ADM) and display protective effect on K562 cells and primary CML-Bp mononuctear cells, inhibited ADM-induced leukimia cell apoptosis (P < 0.05); as compared with CML-chronic phase (CML-Cp) BMMSC and normal BMMSC, the CML-Bp BMMSC showed the highest protective effect on leukemic cells, the mitochondrial membrane potential of co-cultured cells slightly droped (P < 0.05). In the CML-Bp BMMSC cultured with K562 cells, the expression level of caspase-3 was more down-regulated than that in K562 alone plus ADM group, while the expression of caspase-9 significantly increased (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the CML-Bp BMMSC down-regulates ADM-induced leukemia cell appoptosis, its mechanism may relate with the inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potential drop, the stabilization of unactive expression of caspase-9 and down-regulation of caspase-3 expression.","['Wang, Ying', 'Han, Yu-Xiang', 'Niu, Zhi-Yun', 'Wang, Xing-Zhe', 'Hua, Huan', 'Shang, Yin-Tao', 'Wang, Fu-Xu', 'Zhang, Xue-Jun', 'Luo, Jian-Min']","['Wang Y', 'Han YX', 'Niu ZY', 'Wang XZ', 'Hua H', 'Shang YT', 'Wang FX', 'Zhang XJ', 'Luo JM']","['Departments of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Departments of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Departments of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Departments of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Departments of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Departments of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Departments of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Departments of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.

A total of 93 children treated with vinblastine in our department during April 2013 to March 2014 were enrolled in this study and were divided into 3 groups:VDLD, VDLD with azoles antifungal, VDLD with non azoles antifungal. The incidence and severity of hyponatremia were statistically analysed. The results showed that (1) the incidence of hyponatremia in VDLD group was 93.1%(67/72),100%(13/13) in VDLD with azoles antifungal group, and 75%(6/8) in VDLD with non-azoles antifungal, there was no statistically difference between these three groups. (2) Incidence of moderate to severe hyponatremia (Na<129 mmol/L) in VDLD with azoles antifungal group was(9/13,69.2%),which was significartly higher than those in VDLD group (22/72, 30.6%) and in VDLD with non azoles antifungal group (1/8, 12.5%). However, the difference between VDLD group and VDLD with non azoles antifungal group were not statistical significant. (3) the lowest serum sodium level in VDLD with azoles antifungal group (124.0 +/- 8.6 mmol/L) was significantly lower than that in VDLD group (130.8 +/- 3.8 mmol/L)and VDLD+non azoles antifungal group(132.9 +/- 4.9 mmol/L). Otherwise, the difference was not statistically significant between VDLD group and VDLD with non azoles antifungal group. (4) four children with severe hyponatremia showed convulsions and coma which all belong to VDLD with azoles antifungal group. The children with hyponatremia were restricted intake of fluid, adjusted the liquid tension, supplied hypertonic sodium and given diuretic, the serum sodium value gradually picked up in these children. In 4-11 months' follow-up, no hyponatremia happened again in these children. It is concluded that the incident of hyponatremia in children treated with vinblastine is high, but most of them seldom showed clinical characteristics. The combination of antifungal azoles with vinblastine can increase the incidence and severity of hyponatremia. Therefore, combined administration of azole antifungals with vinblastine should be avoided.","['Zhong, Li-Ping', 'Xue, Hong-Man', 'Zhu, Dong-Bo', 'Chen, Chun', 'Xu, Hong-Gui', 'Li, Yang']","['Zhong LP', 'Xue HM', 'Zhu DB', 'Chen C', 'Xu HG', 'Li Y']","['Department of Pediatrics,SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yet-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics,SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yet-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.

All patients were high-risk type of relapsed or refractory AML, including 10 males and 5 females, aged from 16 to 48 years old with mean age of 32.5 years. Ten cases are HLA-identical matching and other 5 cases are HLA-haploidentical.donors received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize the peripheral blood stem cell for transplantation. Conditioning regimen was fludarabine combined with busulfex, cytarabine and cyclophosphamide. The preventive donor's peripheral blood stem cell infusion were performed after 3 months of transplantation, and the toxicity, GVHD and disease-free survival were observed in patients after transplantation. The results showed that all patients achieved hematopoietic reconstitution, the average time of neutrophils >/= 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelets >/= 20 x 10(9)/L were 15.5 d and 16.8 d respectively. Implantation was confirmed by the evidence of 100% donor hematopoiesis. Follow-up to June 2014, with a median follow-up duration of 27.5 months (18-54 months), GVHD occurred in 8 cases of all patients, one died of complication, the other 4 cases died of relapse and the other three patients remained in disease-free survival. The disease-free survival rate of 2-year was 66.7%,the longest disease-free survival time was up to 54 months. It is concluded that the reduced conditioning intensity allo-HSCT is the effective and safe method for relapsed AML with ETO-positive, and it may be chosen as a treatment method for relapsed ETO positive AML patients.","['Guo, Zhi', 'Chen, Hui-Ren', 'Liu, Xiao-Dong', 'Lou, Jing-Xing', 'Yang, Kai', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Chen, Peng', 'He, Xue-Peng']","['Guo Z', 'Chen HR', 'Liu XD', 'Lou JX', 'Yang K', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen P', 'He XP']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Command, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Command, Beijing 100700, China.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) play a key role in innate and adaptive immunity respectively. A patient with severe infection of staphylococcus aureus acquired completely spontaneous remission (SR), moreover a increased number of pDC were observed, suggesting that bacteria-activated pDC may play an important role in SR. This study was purposed to explore if the bacteria can stimulate pDC successfully and get a functional pDC. Both pDC and mDC were isolated from freshly collected, leukocyte-rich buffy coats from healthy blood donor and leukemic patient with SR by using MACS and FACS. The pDC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and were stimulated with different kinds of bacteria and the expression of CD40, CD86 and HLA-DR on the cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry. The cytokine (IFN-alpha, IL-12, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10) production was measured by using ELISA kits. The results showed that the stimulation with staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa resulted in the maturation of pDC, which secrete a large number of IFN-alpha and promote the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells to Th1 cells. The activated pDC expressed high level of CD40 and CD86 and showed higher T cell stimulatory capacities.

Acute myelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and chronic myelocytic leukemia cell line K562 were cultured. The viability of the cells was measured by flow cytometry. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 at the concentrations of 2 or 3 micromol/L was used to stimulate the HL-60 cell cultured for 24 h and 48 h respectively, and the Annexin V/7-AAD staining and flow cytomotry were used to detect the apoptosis of the HL-60 cells. HL-60 and K562 cells were treated with 1 micromol/L MG132 for 24 h and 48 h respectively, then CD80 and CD86 antibodies were added, finally the expression of CD80 and CD86 was analysed by flow cytomery. The mRNA expression of CD86 in the HL-60 cells treated with 1 micromol/L MG132 was detected by RT-PCR. HL-60 and K562 cells were treated by 1 micromol/L MG132 and then underwent irradiation of 75 Gy (60)Co to kill the cells with their antigenicity preserved. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) of healthy volunteers, as reactive cells, were isolated and inoculated into the (60)Co irradiated HL-60 cells of different concentrations, as stimulating cells, CCK-8 was added and then the A value of absorbance was measured at the wave length of 450 nm in an enzyme labeling instrument. The results showed that the cell viability of the HL-60 cells treated with 1 micromol/L MG132 for 24 h an d 48 h was 92.95% and 85.87% respectively. The apoptotic rates of the HL-60 cells treated with MG132 increased in dose-and time-dependent manner. High-concentration of MG132 directly killed HL-60 cells. Before MG132 treatment K562 cells did not express CD86, but the CD86 expression of the HL-60 cells was up-regulated time-dependently after MG132 treatment (P < 0.01). The mRNA expression of CD86 in the HL-60 treated with MG132 was up-regulated time-dependently (P < 0.01). CCK-8 test showed that the proliferation level of PBMNC gradually increased along with the concentration of HL-60 cells treated with MG132 and reached its peak when the concentration of the HL-60 cells was 1x10(5) (P < 0.01).

KU812 cells were treated with different concentrations of GSK525762A (100, 250, 500, 1 000, 2 500 and 5000 nmol/L) and the inhibitory effects of drug on KU812 cell proliferation after 48 and 72 hours were detected by using CCK-8 assay. KU812 cells were treated with 3 different concentrations of GSK525762A (1.0, 2.5 and 5 micromol/L) and the cell apoptosis after 72 hours were assayed by using flow cytometry. KU812 cells were treated with DMSO and 2.5 micromol/L GSK525762A, and the mRNA levels of C-MYC, BCL-2, CDK6, BCL-xL, BAK and BAX were determined by using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that GSK525762A could significantly inhibit the proliferation of KU812 cells and the inhibitory effect on KU812 cell proliferation was dependent on the dose-course and time-course of GSK525762A treatment. GSK525762A treatment could induce apoptosis of KU812 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After GSK525762A treatment, the mRNA levels of proliferation-promoting genes ( C-MYC and CDK6) and pro-survival genes ( BCL-2 and BCL-xL) decreased, while the transcription level of pro-apoptosis genes BAK and BAX increased, as compared to that of the control group. It is concluded that GSK525762A can inhibit the proliferation of KU812 cells and induce cell apoptosis possibly through depressing the transcription of C-MYC, BCL-2, CDK6 and BCL-xL gene, and down-regulating BAK and BAX transcription.","['Xu, Jie', 'Wang, Li', 'Song, Xu-Guang', 'Wu, Qing-Yun', 'Zhao, Kai', 'Zeng, Ling-Yu', 'Han, Zheng-Xiang', 'Chen, Chong', 'Xu, Kai-Lin']","['Xu J', 'Wang L', 'Song XG', 'Wu QY', 'Zhao K', 'Zeng LY', 'Han ZX', 'Chen C', 'Xu KL']","['Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China; Department of Oncology, Xuzhou Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xuzhou Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) was used to detect the copy number of WT1 gene and reference gene (ALB) in bone marrow cells of 228 patients with hematologic neoplasm in our hospital. The gene expression level was determined by using the ratio of the copy number of WT1 gene and reference gene. The results showed that the WT1 expression level between male and female patients was not statistically significantly different (P > 0.05). All the patients were divided into 3 groups: the group aged under 19, the group aged between 19-50, and the group aged over 50; the WT1 expression level among the three groups were not statistically significantly different (P > 0.05) . The above-mentioned patients were redivided into the groups aged under 45 and over 45, the difference between them was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The difference of WT1 expression level between newly diagnosed patients and treated patients with hematologic neoplasm was statistically significant (P < 0.01), but no statistically significant difference of WT1 expression was found (P > 0.05) at each stage within 3 years after treatment, however, among them the difference between newly diagnosed leukemia patients and treated leukemia patients was very statistically significant (P < 0.01), while the difference between newly diagnosed and treated non-leukemia patients was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The expression difference of WT1 between leukemia and non-leukemia patients was very statistically significant (P < 0.01), the difference between the newly diagnosed leukemia and non-leukemia patients also was very statistically significant (P < 0.01). The difference of WT1 expression between treated leukemia and non-leukemia patients was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). It is concluded that the WT1 expression level in leukemia patients can be a reliable marker to evaluate the prognosis of newly diagnosed leukemia and the curative effect for minimal residual disease. No WT1 expression difference has been found before and after treatment among the patients with non-leukemia, such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, therefore, which should be furtherly explored.","['Liu, Hua-Sheng', 'Zhu, Ming-Shang', 'Zhang, Hai-Ling', 'Wei, Shuang-Yu', 'Wang, Xiao-Ning', 'Xi, Xiao-Ping', 'Yu, Fang-Fang', 'Xi, Jie-Ying', 'Wang, Meng-Chang', 'Zhang, Mei']","['Liu HS', 'Zhu MS', 'Zhang HL', 'Wei SY', 'Wang XN', 'Xi XP', 'Yu FF', 'Xi JY', 'Wang MC', 'Zhang M']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Medical College, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China.

Native asparaginase derives from Escherichia coli (colaspase) or Erwinia chrysanthemi (crisantaspase); in a third preparation, colaspase is pegylated. Depletion of asparagine leads to decreased synthesis of procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic proteins, with resultant hypercoagulability and greater risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Colaspase and crisantaspase are not dose-equivalent, with crisantaspase displaying haemostatic toxicity only at dosages much higher and administered more frequently than those of colaspase. Cerebral venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are two life-endangering manifestations that occur during treatment with asparaginase particularly in children and in adults with ALL, respectively. Approximately one-third of VTEs are located in the upper extremities and are central venous line-related. Other risk factors are longer duration of asparaginase treatment and concomitant use of prednisone, anthracyclines, and oral contraceptives. The risk associated with inherited thrombophilia is uncertain but is clearly enhanced by other risk factors or by the use of prednisone. VTE prevention with fresh frozen plasma is not recommended; the efficacy of antithrombin (AT) concentrates has occasionally been reported, but these reports should be confirmed by proper studies, and AT should not be routinely employed. Therapeutic or prophylactic heparin doses are only partially effective, and direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors could play significant roles in the near future.","['De Stefano, Valerio', 'Za, Tommaso', 'Ciminello, Angela', 'Betti, Silvia', 'Rossi, Elena']","['De Stefano V', 'Za T', 'Ciminello A', 'Betti S', 'Rossi E']","['Valerio De Stefano, MD, Institute of Hematology, Catholic University, Largo Gemelli 8, 00168 Rome, Italy, Tel.: +39 06 30154968, Fax: +39 06 30155209, E-mail: valerio.destefano@rm.unicatt.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (Factor Xa Inhibitors)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Factor Xa Inhibitors/chemistry', 'Fibrinolysis/drug effects', 'Hemorrhage/drug therapy', 'Hemostasis/*drug effects', 'Heparin/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Thrombin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thrombosis/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Venous Thromboembolism']",2014/10/24 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['14-04-0372 [pii]', '10.1160/TH14-04-0372 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2015 Feb;113(2):247-61. doi: 10.1160/TH14-04-0372.

METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of data on 41 children with hematologic malignacies with laboratory evidence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) or clinical features indicating high risk for developing TLS. Patients were treated with rasburicase in doses of 0.1-0.15 mg/kg dose, repeated when necessary. RESULTS: Male : Female ratio was 32:9. Thirty-six children had laboratory evidence of TLS and 5 were at risk for TLS. Diagnoses were T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 19; Pre-B ALL, 17; B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 2; T-NHL, 2; and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 1. Initial plasma uric acid (PUA): median, 8.5 mg/dl (range, 4.3 to 45.5). Six had creatinine levels of >2 mg/dl on admission; and 10 had peak PO4 levels of >10 mg/dl. Dose of rasburicase used: median, 0.12 mg/kg (range, 0.08-0.24). Median reduction of PUA at 6 h: 80 % (range 40 to 98 %). Twenty-seven needed only one dose; 12 needed 2 or 3 doses; and two needed 5 doses each. One child required dialysis. None of the children developed anaphylaxis or hemolysis and there were no deaths from TLS. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose rasburicase (0.1-0.15 mg/kg) is safe and effective in reducing PUA in Indian children with lymphoid malignancies, and thus it may reduce the risk of renal failure from TLS.","['Jayabose, Somasundaram', 'Kumar, Vignesh', 'Dhanabalan, Rajeswari', 'Rajan, Priya', 'Rathnam, Krishnakumar', 'Viswanathan, T Kasi']","['Jayabose S', 'Kumar V', 'Dhanabalan R', 'Rajan P', 'Rathnam K', 'Viswanathan TK']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Meenakshi Mission Hospital & Research Centre, Lake Area, Melur Road, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, sjayabose@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141023,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,"['0 (Gout Suppressants)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gout Suppressants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*drug therapy', 'Urate Oxidase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Uric Acid/blood', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/24 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12098-014-1606-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2015 May;82(5):458-61. doi: 10.1007/s12098-014-1606-1.

We evaluated agricultural use of specific insecticides, fungicides, and fumigants and risk of NHL and NHL-subtypes (including CLL and MM) in a U.S.-based prospective cohort of farmers and commercial pesticide applicators. A total of 523 cases occurred among 54,306 pesticide applicators from enrollment (1993-97) through December 31, 2011 in Iowa, and December 31, 2010 in North Carolina. Information on pesticide use, other agricultural exposures and other factors was obtained from questionnaires at enrollment and at follow-up approximately five years later (1999-2005). Information from questionnaires, monitoring, and the literature were used to create lifetime-days and intensity-weighted lifetime days of pesticide use, taking into account exposure-modifying factors. Poisson and polytomous models were used to calculate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate associations between 26 pesticides and NHL and five NHL-subtypes, while adjusting for potential confounding factors. For total NHL, statistically significant positive exposure-response trends were seen with lindane and DDT. Terbufos was associated with total NHL in ever/never comparisons only. In subtype analyses, terbufos and DDT were associated with small cell lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia/marginal cell lymphoma, lindane and diazinon with follicular lymphoma, and permethrin with MM. However, tests of homogeneity did not show significant differences in exposure-response among NHL-subtypes for any pesticide. Because 26 pesticides were evaluated for their association with NHL and its subtypes, some chance finding could have occurred. Our results showed pesticides from different chemical and functional classes were associated with an excess risk of NHL and NHL subtypes, but not all members of any single class of pesticides were associated with an elevated risk of NHL or NHL subtypes. These findings are among the first to suggest links between DDT, lindane, permethrin, diazinon and terbufos with NHL subtypes.","['Alavanja, Michael C R', 'Hofmann, Jonathan N', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Hines, Cynthia J', 'Barry, Kathryn H', 'Barker, Joseph', 'Buckman, Dennis W', 'Thomas, Kent', 'Sandler, Dale P', 'Hoppin, Jane A', 'Koutros, Stella', 'Andreotti, Gabriella', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Beane Freeman, Laura E']","['Alavanja MC', 'Hofmann JN', 'Lynch CF', 'Hines CJ', 'Barry KH', 'Barker J', 'Buckman DW', 'Thomas K', 'Sandler DP', 'Hoppin JA', 'Koutros S', 'Andreotti G', 'Lubin JH', 'Blair A', 'Beane Freeman LE']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'College of Public Health, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of America.', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'IMS, Inc, Calverton, Maryland, United States of America.', 'IMS, Inc, Calverton, Maryland, United States of America.', 'National Exposure Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Epidemiology Branch, National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Epidemiology Branch, National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141022,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Fungicides, Industrial)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated)', '0 (Insecticides)', '8003-19-8 (Fumigant 93)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology"", 'Agriculture', 'Fungicides, Industrial/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/toxicity', 'Insecticides/toxicity', 'Iowa', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/chemically induced/*epidemiology/pathology', 'North Carolina', 'Risk Factors']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109332 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-10356 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 22;9(10):e109332. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109332. eCollection 2014.,,,"['P30 ES005605/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 CP010119/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 ES049030/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4206281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the cell surface markers revealed that the cells were positive for mature plasma cell-1 (MPC-1), and negative for cluster of differentiation (CD) 45 and CD49e, suggestive of an intermediate level of maturity of the cells. The disease was refractory to bortezomib-dexamethasone (BD) therapy and progressed to plasma cell leukemia despite the treatment. Treatment was therefore switched to lenalidomide-dexamethasone (RD) therapy, however, the condition again proved to be refractory to this therapy.

The patient was treated with 6 courses of CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone), which resulted in complete remission (CR). However, the rash recurred in late October 2013, and treatment with mogamulizumab was initiated. A total of 8 courses of mogamulizumab were administered, which resulted in CR.

However, the Philadelphia chromosome translocation (Ph+), t(9;22)(q34;q11), is present in a small subset of patients and confers poor outcomes. CD25 (IL-2 receptor alpha chain) expression has been associated with Ph+ B-ALL in adults, but no similar study has been performed in pediatric B-ALL. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 221 consecutive pediatric patients with a diagnosis of B-ALL (blood and/or bone marrow) from 2009 to 2012 was performed to determine an association between Ph+ B-ALL and CD25 expression. A threshold of 25% was used to define positive cases for CD25 expression by flow cytometry. RESULTS: There were 221 patients with a diagnosis of B-ALL ranging from 2 to 22 years (median, 6 years). Eight (3.6%) B-ALL patients were positive for the Philadelphia chromosome translocation (Ph+ B-ALL) and 213 were negative (Ph-negative B-ALL). CD25 expression was observed in 6 of 8 (75%) Ph+ B-ALL patients and 6 of 213 (2.8%) Ph-negative B-ALL patients. CD25 expression was significantly higher in Ph+ B-ALL compared to Ph-negative B-ALL, with median CD25 expression of 64% (range 0-93%) and 0.1% (range 0-91%), respectively (P </= 0.0002). Therefore, CD25 expression as a predictor of Ph+ B-ALL had 75% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 50% positive predictive value and 99% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: CD25 expression is a specific and relatively sensitive marker for the identification of Ph+ B-ALL in the pediatric population.","['Gaikwad, Amos S', 'Donohue, Rachel E', 'Elghetany, M Tarek', 'Sheehan, Andrea M', 'Lu, Xinyan Y', 'Gramatges, Maria M', 'McClain, Kenneth L', 'Mistretta, Toni-Ann', 'Punia, Jyotinder N', 'Moore, Timothy J', 'Goltsova, Tatiana', 'Cubbage, Michael', 'Curry, Choladda V']","['Gaikwad AS', 'Donohue RE', 'Elghetany MT', 'Sheehan AM', 'Lu XY', 'Gramatges MM', 'McClain KL', 'Mistretta TA', 'Punia JN', 'Moore TJ', 'Goltsova T', 'Cubbage M', 'Curry CV']","[""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers Houston, Texas ; Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Hematopathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers Houston, Texas ; Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers Houston, Texas ; Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers Houston, Texas."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers Houston, Texas."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140815,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', '*Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*analysis', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Aug 15;7(9):6225-30. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['B acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'B-ALL', 'BCR-ABL', 'CD25', 'Ph+', 'Ph+ B-ALL', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'flow cytometry', 'pediatric', 't(9;22)']",,PMC4203245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we performed the protein profiling of the bone marrow mononuclear cells from the patients with acute leukemia and the health volunteers (control) by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI_TOF_MS). The patients with acute leukemia were analyzed as unitary by the profiling that were grouped into acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acute myeloid leukemia-granulocytic (AML-Gran), acute myeloid leukemia-monocytic (AML-Mon) acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and control. Based on 109 proteomic signatures, the classification models of acute leukemia were constructed to screen the predictors by the improvement of the proteomic signatures and to detect their expression characteristics. According to the improvement and the expression characteristics of the predictors, the proteomic signatures (M3829, M1593, M2121, M2536, M1016) characterized successively each group (CON, APL, AML-Gra, AML-Mon, ALL) were screened as target molecules for identification. Meanwhile, the proteomic-based class of determinant samples could be made by the classification models. The credibility of the proteomic-based classification passed the evaluation of Biomarker Patterns Software 5.0 (BPS 5.0) scoring and validated application in clinical practice. The results suggested that the proteomic signatures characterized by different blasts were potential for developing new treatment and monitoring approaches of leukemia blasts.

PTK7 (protein tyrosine kinase 7) belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase family involved in several physiological, but also malignant, cell behaviors. Recent studies in acute myeloid leukemia have associated PTK7 expression with resistance to anthracycline therapy. PTK7 mRNA expression in primary tumor tissue (PTT) and corresponding lymph node tissue (LNT) were retrospectively measured in 117 patients with early breast cancer; PTK7 expression was available in 103 PTT and 108 LNT samples. Median age was 60 years (range, 27-87 years). At a median follow-up of 28.5 months, 6 deaths and 16 recurrences had occurred. PTK7 expression correlations with clinicopathological features were computed and PTK7 expression effects on patient outcome were analyzed in three cohorts defined by adjuvant treatment: anthracycline-based treatment, other chemotherapy regimens (including taxane or other substances), or no chemotherapy. Association of PTK7 expression with clinicopathological features was seen only for age in PTT and nodal stage in LNT. High LN PTK7 was associated with poorer disease-free survival (DFS) in the total population (3-year DFS: low [81.7%] versus high [70.4%]; P=0.016) and in patients without adjuvant chemotherapy (3-year DFS: low [91.7%] versus high [22.3%]; P<0.001), but not in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.552). DFS stratified by PTK7 expression was compared in treatment cohorts: In patients with low LN PTK7 expression, neither chemotherapy cohort showed significantly better survival than the no-chemotherapy cohort. In patients with high LN PTK7 expression, those receiving chemotherapy, including substances other than anthracyclines, but not those receiving only anthracycline-based chemotherapy, showed significantly better DFS than those receiving no chemotherapy (P=0.001). Our results support earlier findings that PTK7 may be a prognostic and predictive marker associated with resistance to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Further investigations are needed to validate these findings in breast cancer.","['Ataseven, Beyhan', 'Gunesch, Angela', 'Eiermann, Wolfgang', 'Kates, Ronald E', 'Hogel, Bernhard', 'Knyazev, Pjotr', 'Ullrich, Axel', 'Harbeck, Nadia']","['Ataseven B', 'Gunesch A', 'Eiermann W', 'Kates RE', 'Hogel B', 'Knyazev P', 'Ullrich A', 'Harbeck N']","['Department of Gynecology and Gynecologic Oncology, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Essen, Germany ; Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Rotkreuzklinikum Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Rotkreuzklinikum Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Oncology, Interdisciplinary Oncology Center Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Breast Center, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Rotkreuzklinikum Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Breast Center, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141006,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2014/10/23 06:00,2014/10/23 06:01,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S62676 [doi]', 'ott-7-1723 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2014 Oct 6;7:1723-31. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S62676. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['PTK7', 'breast cancer', 'chemoresistance', 'predictive factors', 'prognostic factors', 'protein tyrosine kinase 7']",,PMC4199823,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HHV-6 and HHV-8 seropositivity were shown in a healthy population. There is no published data in Turkey about seroprevalence of these viruses. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of HHV-6 and HHV-8 in pediatric cancer patients and to compare with healthy Turkish children's viral seroprevalence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three pediatric cancer patients and 43 age-matched healthy children were included in the study. All sera were screened for antibodies to HHV-6 and HHV-8 by ELISA. RESULTS: HHV-8 immunoglobulin G (IgG) was positive in 3.3% of lymphoma patients, in 4.8% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, in 4.8% of retinoblastoma patients and in 7% of healthy children. There was no significant difference in HHV-8 seroprevelance between these groups. HHV-6 seroprevalence was 81% in ALL patients, 70% in lymphoma group, 81% in retinoblastoma patients and 69.8% in healthy children. Although there was no significant difference in HHV-6 prevalence between healthy children and pediatric cancer patients, HHV-6 seropositivity tended to be higher in retinoblastoma patients under age of 4 years (odds ratio: 2.925). CONCLUSION: HHV-6 seroprevalence was higher than HHV-8 seropositivity in our study. Viral studies related HHV-6 seroprevelance in retinoblastoma patients would be useful to clarify if there is any etiological association between HHV-6 and retinoblastoma.","['Tacyildiz, Nurdan', 'Dincaslan, Handan Ugur', 'Ozdemir, Halil', 'Yavuz, Gulsan', 'Unal, Emel', 'Ikinciogullari, Aydan', 'Dogu, Figen', 'Guloglu, Deniz', 'Suskan, Emine', 'Kose, Kenan']","['Tacyildiz N', 'Dincaslan HU', 'Ozdemir H', 'Yavuz G', 'Unal E', 'Ikinciogullari A', 'Dogu F', 'Guloglu D', 'Suskan E', 'Kose K']","['Department of Pediatrics Oncology, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics Oncology, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Infection Diseases, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics Oncology, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics Oncology, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Immunology, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Immunology, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Immunology, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Ankara University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,,2014/10/23 06:00,2014/10/23 06:01,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.142039 [doi]', 'IJMPO-35-221 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2014 Jul;35(3):221-5. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.142039.,['NOTNLM'],"['Herpesvirus-6', 'herpesvirus-8', 'pediatric malignancies']",,PMC4202619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proapoptotic BIM protein is an important mediator of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in normal and malignant lymphocytes, whereas the antiapoptotic BCL2 confers resistance. The signaling pathways regulating BIM and BCL2 expression in glucocorticoid-treated lymphoid cells remain unclear. In this study, pediatric ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) inherently sensitive or resistant to glucocorticoids were exposed to dexamethasone in vivo. Microarray analysis showed that KLF13 and MYB gene expression changes were significantly greater in dexamethasone-sensitive than -resistant PDXs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis detected glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding at the KLF13 promoter to trigger KLF13 expression only in sensitive PDXs. Next, KLF13 bound to the MYB promoter, deactivating MYB expression only in sensitive PDXs. Sustained MYB expression in resistant PDXs resulted in maintenance of BCL2 expression and inhibition of apoptosis. ChIP sequencing analysis revealed a novel GR binding site in a BIM intronic region (IGR) that was engaged only in dexamethasone-sensitive PDXs. The absence of GR binding at the BIM IGR was associated with BIM silencing and dexamethasone resistance. This study has identified novel mechanisms of opposing BCL2 and BIM gene regulation that control glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in pediatric ALL cells in vivo.","['Jing, Duohui', 'Bhadri, Vivek A', 'Beck, Dominik', 'Thoms, Julie A I', 'Yakob, Nurul A', 'Wong, Jason W H', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'Pimanda, John E', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Jing D', 'Bhadri VA', 'Beck D', 'Thoms JA', 'Yakob NA', 'Wong JW', 'Knezevic K', 'Pimanda JE', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the."", 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and.', 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the."", 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and.', 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and.', 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and Department of Haematology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and the.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141021,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35352-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-576470 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 8;125(2):273-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-576470.

METHODS: We performed an open-label, controlled, parallel-group randomized trial in 13 Spanish centers. Adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome on induction therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients were randomized (1:1 ratio) to 1 of 2 arms: ""GM-PCR group"" (the results of serial serum GM and PCR assays were provided to treating physicians) and ""GM group"" (only the results of serum GM were informed). Positivity in either assay prompted thoracic computed tomography scan and initiation of antifungal therapy. No antimold prophylaxis was permitted. RESULTS: Overall, 219 patients underwent randomization (105 in the GM-PCR group and 114 in the GM group). The cumulative incidence of ""proven"" or ""probable"" IA (primary study outcome) was lower in the GM-PCR group (4.2% vs 13.1%; odds ratio, 0.29 [95% confidence interval, .09-.91]). The median interval from the start of monitoring to the diagnosis of IA was lower in the GM-PCR group (13 vs 20 days; P = .022), as well as the use of empirical antifungal therapy (16.7% vs 29.0%; P = .038). Patients in the GM-PCR group had higher proven or probable IA-free survival (P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: A combined monitoring strategy based on serum GM and Aspergillus DNA was associated with an earlier diagnosis and a lower incidence of IA in high-risk hematological patients.

Therefore, there is a considerable interest in developing small molecules that can mimic helical peptide segments to modulate alpha-helix-mediated PPIs. Due to the relatively low aqueous solubility and synthetic difficulty of most current alpha-helix mimetic small molecules, one important goal in this area is to develop small molecules with favorable physicochemical properties and ease of synthesis. Here we designed phenyl-piperazine-triazine-based alpha-helix mimetics that possess improved water solubility and excellent synthetic accessibility. We developed a facile solid-phase synthetic route that allows for rapid creation of a large, diverse combinatorial library of alpha-helix mimetics. Further, we identified a selective inhibitor of the Mcl-1/BH3 interaction by screening a focused library of phenyl-piperazine-triazines, demonstrating that the scaffold is able to serve as functional mimetics of alpha-helical peptides. We believe that our phenyl-piperazine-triazine-based alpha-helix mimetics, along with the facile and divergent solid-phase synthetic method, have great potential as powerful tools for discovering potent inhibitors of given alpha-helix-mediated PPIs.","['Moon, Heejo', 'Lee, Woo Sirl', 'Oh, Misook', 'Lee, Huisun', 'Lee, Ji Hoon', 'Im, Wonpil', 'Lim, Hyun-Suk']","['Moon H', 'Lee WS', 'Oh M', 'Lee H', 'Lee JH', 'Im W', 'Lim HS']","['Department of Chemistry, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) , Pohang 790-784, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141103,United States,ACS Comb Sci,ACS combinatorial science,101540531,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Triazines)']",IM,"['Benzoates/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', '*Biomimetics', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry', 'Piperazines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Solid-Phase Synthesis Techniques/methods', 'Triazines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/co500114f [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Comb Sci. 2014 Dec 8;16(12):695-701. doi: 10.1021/co500114f.

Irradiated B6D2F1 mice given C57BL/6 BM and splenic T cells and treated with hMSCs had reduced systemic GvHD, donor T-cell expansion, and serum TNFalpha and IFNgamma levels. Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated that hMSCs redistributed from lungs to abdominal organs within 72 hours, and target tissues harvested from hMSC-treated allogeneic BMT (alloBMT) mice had less GvHD than untreated controls. Cryoimaging more precisely revealed that hMSCs preferentially distributed to splenic marginal zones and regulated T-cell expansion in the white pulp. Importantly, hMSCs had no effect on in vitro cytotoxic T-cell activity and preserved potent GvL effects in vivo. Mixed leukocyte cultures containing hMSCs exhibited decreased T-cell proliferation, reduced TNFalpha, IFNgamma, and IL-10 but increased PGE2 levels. Indomethacin and E-prostanoid 2 (EP2) receptor antagonisms both reversed while EP2 agonism restored hMSC-mediated in vitro T-cell suppression, confirming the role for PGE2 . Furthermore, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition following alloBMT abrogated the protective effects of hMSCs. Together, our data show that hMSCs preserve GvL activity and attenuate GvHD and reveal that hMSC biodistribute to secondary lymphoid organs wherein they attenuate alloreactive T-cell proliferation likely through PGE2 induction.","['Auletta, Jeffery J', 'Eid, Saada K', 'Wuttisarnwattana, Patiwet', 'Silva, Ines', 'Metheny, Leland', 'Keller, Matthew D', 'Guardia-Wolff, Rocio', 'Liu, Chen', 'Wang, Fangjing', 'Bowen, Theodore', 'Lee, Zhenghong', 'Solchaga, Luis A', 'Ganguly, Sudipto', 'Tyler, Megan', 'Wilson, David L', 'Cooke, Kenneth R']","['Auletta JJ', 'Eid SK', 'Wuttisarnwattana P', 'Silva I', 'Metheny L', 'Keller MD', 'Guardia-Wolff R', 'Liu C', 'Wang F', 'Bowen T', 'Lee Z', 'Solchaga LA', 'Ganguly S', 'Tyler M', 'Wilson DL', 'Cooke KR']","[""Host Defense Program, Hematology/Oncology/BMT and Infectious Diseases, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA; Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1867 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2015 Feb;33(2):601-14. doi: 10.1002/stem.1867.,['NOTNLM'],"['Graft-versus-host disease', 'Graft-versus-leukemia', 'Mesenchymal stromal cells']","['AI 57801/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA076917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI057801/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4304927,['NIHMS635903'],,,['(c) 2014 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical and single-arm trials have suggested that adding histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may synergize the epigenetic modulation of hypomethylating agents and improve treatment results. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of adding valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor, to decitabine in the treatment of MDS and AML. RESULTS: Patients with higher risk MDS or with AML aged >/=60 years were eligible. Patients were randomized in a Bayesian response-adaptive design to receive intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days or decitabine plus oral valproic acid 50 mg/kg daily for 7 days. Courses were repeated every 4 to 6 weeks. A maximum of 150 patients were to be treated. In total, 149 patients were treated on study, including 87 patients with MDS and 62 patients with AML. The median patient age was 69 years (range, 20-89 years; 42% of patients were aged >/=70 years). Overall, 34% of patients achieved complete remission, and 55% had an objective response. The median survival was 11.9 months, and the estimated 2-year survival rate was 27%. Outcome was not different with the addition of valproic acid to decitabine versus decitabine alone in relation to the rates of complete remission, overall response, or survival. Subset analyses did not demonstrate a benefit within the MDS or AML categories. Toxicities-particularly neurotoxicities-were higher with the combination arm. CONCLUSIONS: Adding valproic acid to decitabine was not associated with improved outcome in the treatment of patients with MDS or elderly patients with AML. Future therapies may consider combining hypomethylating agents with better HDAC inhibitors and using different schedules.","['Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Issa JP', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Huang X', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F', 'Jabbour E', 'Borthakur G', 'Brandt M', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141021,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Valproic Acid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29085 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Feb 15;121(4):556-61. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29085.

With the effects of ammonium chloride (NH4 Cl) lysis on erythroid progenitors previously described, we applied this protocol to a patient cohort with diagnosed MDS to investigate phenotypic abnormalities that indicate erythroid dysplasia. Method: Bone marrow specimens [39 MDS, 9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 7 JAK2(V617F) positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), 5 nutritional deficiencies] were processed by NH4 Cl lysis and Ficoll preparation and evaluated by MDF using a difference from normal algorithm. Results: For the MDS cohort, phenotypic abnormalities on the mature erythroid progenitors were frequent for CD71 and CD36 (36% for each antigen); abnormalities for CD235a (8%) were observed. Among immature erythroid progenitors, abnormal maturation patterns (</=5%) and increased CD105 intensity (9%) were seen. Increased frequency of CD105 bright cells was observed (18%). While antigenic abnormalities correlated between NH4 Cl lysis and Ficoll preparation, the lysis method demonstrated the most consistent quantitative antigen intensities. Mean erythroid phenotypic abnormalities and prognostic cytogenetic subgroups correlated strongly. Morphologic and erythroid phenotypic abnormalities correlated, as did increasing FCSS and number of erythroid abnormalities, albeit without further increase for AML patients. Discussion: These data expand the understanding of erythropoiesis and define immunophenotypic abnormalities that indicate dyserythropoiesis in MDS utilizing a lysis protocol practical for routine implementation in clinical flow cytometric work-up. Preliminary studies also indicate strong correlation between phenotypic erythroid dysplasia and poor prognosis, as classified cytogenetically.

The reason for this, at least in part, is the lack of an in vitro system that recapitulates the NETosis pathway using established human cell lines. We show that exposure of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 to the glycosyltransferase inhibitor tunicamycin (TM) resulted in extrusion of decompacted genomic DNAs to extracellular space, morphologically similar to NETs. Immunostaining using antibodies against NET marker proteins and bacterial trapping assay showed biochemical similarities between the TM-induced extracellular DNA structures and NETs. The NET-like structures were also generated on exposure of TM to other myeloid cell lines, such as U937 and THP-1. Thus, our findings provide an experimental setting to induce NET-like structures using cultured human myeloid cell lines, which may help our understanding of the regulation and function of NETosis.","['Nakayama, Tomofumi', 'Saitoh, Hisato']","['Nakayama T', 'Saitoh H']","['Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141119,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 2.4.- (Glycosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Traps/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Glycosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/10/23 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbin.10396 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2015 Mar;39(3):355-9. doi: 10.1002/cbin.10396.

However, the upstream effectors of this pathway have not been clearly defined. Here, we show that periodic tryptophan protein 1 (Pwp1), a WD-40 repeat-containing protein associated with histone H4 modification, is required for the exit of mESCs from the pluripotent state into all lineages. Knockdown (KD) of Pwp1 does not affect mESC proliferation, self-renewal, or apoptosis. However, KD of Pwp1 impairs the differentiation potential of mESCs both in vitro and in vivo. PWP1 chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq results revealed that the PWP1-occupied regions were marked with significant levels of H4K20me3. Moreover, Pwp1 binds to sites in the upstream region of Stat3.

However, protein A chromatography is often not effective for viral clearance. Typical log reduction values (LRV) for the model retrovirus XMuLV range between 1 and 4 logs, while effective steps such as viral filtration can achieve 5-7 logs of clearance. XMuLV LRVs obtained on protein A are reproducible for a given mAb, but can vary widely for different mAbs, even with the same operating conditions. In order to understand the mechanism of XMuLV clearance on protein A, we have investigated its partitioning on Mabselect SuRe protein A resin and explored how the virus interacts with resin, product, and impurities. The results show that XMuLV has some interaction with the resin backbone and ligand, but also appears to bind to and coelute with the mAb. The interaction with product was further examined by evaluating the effect of feed conditions, loading, and different washes on XMuLV partitioning on the column. Understanding the mechanism of XMuLV removal on a protein A, resin provides insight into the variability and low viral clearance of this step and suggests ways in which the removal of virus by this step can be improved.","['Bach, Julia', 'Connell-Crowley, Lisa']","['Bach J', 'Connell-Crowley L']","['Drug Substance Development, Amgen Inc., 1201 Amgen Court West, Seattle, 98119, Washington.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150217,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*isolation & purification', 'Chromatography, Affinity/*methods', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/*metabolism', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*isolation & purification']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bit.25484 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2015 Apr;112(4):743-50. doi: 10.1002/bit.25484.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a quantitative assessment of this correlation, an updated meta-analysis of cohort studies was performed to derive a more precise estimation of the prognostic significance of IKZF1-d. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases until January 31, 2014. A total of 15 published studies including 5021 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. Combined hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with random-effects model. RESULTS: Combined hazard ratios suggested that IKZF1 deletion (IKZF1-d) had an unfavorable impact on event-free survival (EFS) (HR=2.32, 95%CI: 1.97-2.74) and overall survival (OS) (HR=2.56, 95%CI: 1.75-3.74) in patients with ALL. The significant role of IKZF1-d in the prognosis of ALL was also observed among different subgroups stratified by statistical methodology, ethnicity, age, detection method, risk group and duration of follow up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this meta-analysis suggest that IKZF1 deletion can be used to serve as an independent predictive factor in patients with ALL.","['Jia, Ming', 'Wang, Zhu-Jun', 'Li, Jing-Yuan', 'Yang, Shi-Long', 'Zhao, Hai-Zhao', 'Cheng, Yu-Ping', 'Luo, Ze-Bin', 'Tang, Yong-Min']","['Jia M', 'Wang ZJ', 'Li JY', 'Yang SL', 'Zhao HZ', 'Cheng YP', 'Luo ZB', 'Tang YM']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'China', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Prognosis', 'Sequence Deletion']",2014/10/23 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['G8217G0244858ML5 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-140425 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2014;14(6):493-503. doi: 10.3233/CBM-140425.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'IKZF1', 'meta-analysis', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to suppress thymidylate synthase (TYMS) in lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and induce apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia. With TYMS as a putative therapeutic target, the effect of ATO in mesothelioma was therefore studied. A panel of 5 mesothelioma cell lines was used to study the effect of ATO on cell viability, protein expression, mRNA expression and TYMS activity by MTT assay, western blot, qPCR and tritium-release assay, respectively. The knockdown of TYMS and E2F1 was performed with a specific siRNA. Phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were measured by Annexin V and JC-1 staining respectively. The in vivo effect of ATO was studied using a nude mouse xenograft model. Application of ATO demonstrated anticancer effects in the cell line model with clinically achievable concentrations. Downregulation of TYMS protein (except H226 cells and 1.25 microM ATO in H2052 cells) and mRNA expression (H28 cells), pRB1 (H28 cells) and E2F1 and TYMS activity (except H226 cells) were also evident. E2F1 knockdown decreased cell viability more significantly than TYMS knockdown. In general, thymidine kinase 1, ribonucleotide reductase M1, c-myc and skp2 were downregulated by ATO. p-c-Jun was downregulated in H28 cells while upregulated in 211H cells. Phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and upregulation of Bak and cleaved caspase-3 were observed. In the H226 xenograft model, the relative tumor growth was aborted, and E2F1 was downregulated while cleaved caspase-3 was elevated and localized to the nucleus in the ATO treatment group. ATO has potent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in mesothelioma in vitro and in vivo, partially mediated through E2F1 targeting (less effect through TYMS targeting). There is sound scientific evidence to support the clinical application of ATO in treatment of mesothelioma.","['Lam, Sze-Kwan', 'Li, Yuan-Yuan', 'Zheng, Chun-Yan', 'Ho, James Chung-Man']","['Lam SK', 'Li YY', 'Zheng CY', 'Ho JC']","['Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, SAR, P.R.

In the present study, we found a reduction of miR-7 expression in Lewis lung cancer (3LL) cells originating from mice by real-time RT-PCR. Restoration of miR-7 inhibited 3LL cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis in vitro and reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. We further confirmed that miR-7 downregulated the expression of both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and murine leukemia viral oncogene homologue-1 (RAF-1) oncogenes by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Furthermore, inhibition of EGFR showed similar effects to miR-7 enforcement in 3LL cells. Taken together, these findings revealed that miR-7 acts as an antitumor miRNA in 3LL by targeting and suppressing the expression of both EGFR and RAF-1 oncogenes.

However, studies on maternal benzene exposure during pregnancy and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have not been systematically assessed. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between maternal solvent, paint, petroleum exposure, and smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood ALL. METHODS: Relevant studies up to September 1st, 2013 were identified by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library and the Web of Science databases. The effects were pooled using either fixed or random effect models based on the heterogeneity of the studies. RESULTS: Twenty-eight case-control studies and one cohort study were included for analysis, with a total of 16,695 cases and 1,472,786 controls involved. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for ALL was 1.25 (1.09, 1.45) for solvent, 1.23 (1.02, 1.47) for paint, 1.42 (1.10, 1.84) for petroleum exposure, and 0.99 (0.93, 1.06) for maternal smoking during pregnancy. No publication bias was found in this meta-analysis and consistent results were observed for subgroup and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood ALL was associated with maternal solvent, paint, and petroleum exposure during pregnancy. No association was found between ALL and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Avoidance of maternal occupational and environmental benzene exposure during pregnancy could contribute to a decrease in the risk of childhood ALL.","['Zhou, Yanfeng', 'Zhang, Shaozun', 'Li, Zhen', 'Zhu, Jie', 'Bi, Yongyi', 'Bai, YuE', 'Wang, Hong']","['Zhou Y', 'Zhang S', 'Li Z', 'Zhu J', 'Bi Y', 'Bai Y', 'Wang H']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

There are several reports on rodent SSC cultures; however, data on SSC cultures in domestic animals are limited. To provide basic scientific information on canine SSC cultures, we report canine testes development, and the development of spermatogonia-derived colonies (SDCs) for in vitro cultures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Testes from 2-, 3-, and 12-month-old beagles were used for histology, immunohistochemistry, in vitro culture, immunocytochemistry, and PCR. Protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5)-positive spermatogonia, both single and paired, were found to be abundant in the testes of 2-month-old beagles. stempro-34 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 5% fetal bovine serum provided as useful substrates for culture of SDCs, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) played a key role in colony formation. Colonies were positive for alkaline phosphatase and anti-PGP9.5 staining. The early spermatogonia and stem cell markers such as octamer binding protein 4 (Oct4), Nanog homeobox (Nanog), promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), PGP9.5, and GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFRalpha-1) were expressed in the colonies at higher levels than in the testis tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Testes of the 2-month-old beagles had abundant single and paired spermatogonia, which can be used for derivation of SDCs, and FGF was important for colony formation.","['Lee, Kyung Hoon', 'Lee, Ran', 'Lee, Won Young', 'Kim, Dong Hoon', 'Chung, Hak Jae', 'Kim, Jin Hoi', 'Kim, Nam Hyung', 'Choi, Suk Hwa', 'Kim, Jae Hwan', 'Song, Hyuk']","['Lee KH', 'Lee R', 'Lee WY', 'Kim DH', 'Chung HJ', 'Kim JH', 'Kim NH', 'Choi SH', 'Kim JH', 'Song H']","['Department of Animal and Food Bioscience, RIBH, Konkuk University, Chung-ju, Korea.', 'Department of Animal and Food Bioscience, RIBH, Konkuk University, Chung-ju, Korea.', 'Department of Animal and Food Bioscience, RIBH, Konkuk University, Chung-ju, Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, Suwon, Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Animal Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Animal Science, Chungbuk National University, Choung-ju, Korea.', 'Department of Veterinary Science, Chungbuk National University, Choung-ju, Korea.', 'Departmemt of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Animal and Food Bioscience, RIBH, Konkuk University, Chung-ju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141015,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Dogs', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2014/10/22 06:00,2015/06/25 06:00,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109963 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-20374 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 15;9(10):e109963. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109963. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4198177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NostD3 [(1E,4E)-1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-enyl)penta-1,4-dien -3-one] inhibited cell growth more potently than Nost. To elucidate the mechanisms of NostD3-induced cell death, we examined changes in cell morphology, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMT), and DNA fragmentation. From these results, the cytotoxic effects of NostD3 were found to be mainly due to Type I programmed cell death (PCDI; i.e., apoptosis). Using caspase inhibitors, we further found that NostD-3-induced PCDI occurred through a caspase-independent pathway. Moreover, NostD3 decreased MMT and modulated multiple signaling molecules (MAPKs, Akt, Bcl-2, Bax, and c-Myc) in Jurkat cells, thereby inducing the release of endonuclease G (Endo-G) from mitochondria. The level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells treated with NostD3 was elevated up to 1 h after the treatment. However, suppression of ROS by N-acetyl-l-cysteine restored Jurkat cell growth. Taken together, our data suggested that ROS production acted as a trigger in NostD3-induced PCDI in Jurkat cells through release of Endo-G from the mitochondria.","['Itoh, Tomohiro', 'Muramatsu, Yuji', 'Masu, Masayo', 'Tsuge, Ayaka', 'Taniguchi, Masaki', 'Ninomiya, Masayuki', 'Ando, Masashi', 'Tsukamasa, Yasuyuki', 'Koketsu, Mamoru']","['Itoh T', 'Muramatsu Y', 'Masu M', 'Tsuge A', 'Taniguchi M', 'Ninomiya M', 'Ando M', 'Tsukamasa Y', 'Koketsu M']","['a Laboratory of Aquatic Food Science, Department of Fisheries, Faculty of Agriculture , Kinki University , Nara , Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141021,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endonuclease G)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Nostoc commune/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2014/10/22 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2014.956255 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2014;66(8):1414-23. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2014.956255.

In contrast, hepatic PLZF knockdown improved glucose homeostasis in db/db mice. Mechanistically, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha and the glucocorticoid receptor synergistically activated PLZF expression.

Therefore, new treatment is urgently required. GX15-070 is a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor which has shown promising antitumor activity in different malignancies. We previously demonstrated that clinically achievable concentrations of GX15-070 caused growth arrest in pancreatic cancer cell lines. However, they only induced minimal levels of apoptosis. We hypothesized that GX15-070 induced autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells which blocked apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of GX15-070 on autophagy and the antitumor activities of the combination of GX15-070 and chloroquine (CQ), an autophagy inhibitor, in six pancreatic cancer cell lines. We found that GX15-070 treatment indeed induced autophagy in 5 of the 6 pancreatic cancer cell lines, reflected by the conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II and detection of autophagosomes by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we found additive to synergistic antitumor interactions in all six cell lines by MTT assays. CQ significantly enhanced GX15-070-induced apoptosis in the cell line models, possibly due to downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 in the cells by the two agents.

We and others have shown that signaling from the bone marrow microenvironment confers therapeutic resistance, and that the interaction between CXCR4 and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) is a key mediator of this effect. We demonstrate that ALL cells that upregulate surface CXCR4 in response to chemotherapy treatment are protected from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis when co-cultured with bone marrow stroma. Treatment with the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor diminishes stromal protection and confers chemosensitivity. Using xenograft models of high-risk pediatric ALL, plerixafor plus chemotherapy induces significantly decreased leukemic burden, compared to chemotherapy alone. Further, treatment with plerixafor and chemotherapy influences surface expression of CXCR4, VLA-4, and CXCR7 in surviving ALL blasts. Finally, prolonged exposure of ALL blasts to plerixafor leads to a persistent increase in surface CXCR4 expression, along with modulation of surface expression of additional adhesion molecules, and enhanced SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis, findings that may have implications for therapeutic resistance. Our results suggest that while CXCR4 inhibition may prove useful in ALL, further study is needed to understand the full effects of targeting the leukemic microenvironment.","['Sison, Edward Allan R', 'Magoon, Daniel', 'Li, Li', 'Annesley, Colleen E', 'Rau, Rachel E', 'Small, Donald', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Sison EA', 'Magoon D', 'Li L', 'Annesley CE', 'Rau RE', 'Small D', 'Brown P']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Oncology and Pediatrics, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Oncology and Pediatrics, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Oncology and Pediatrics, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Oncology and Pediatrics, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Oncology and Pediatrics, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (ACKR3 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzylamines', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclams', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, CXCR/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2014/10/22 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['2407 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2407 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Oct 15;5(19):8947-58. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2407.,,,['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4253409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the activity of ABT-199 against CML cell lines, as well as primary CML and normal cord blood (NCB) progenitors. We find that BCL2 expression levels predict sensitivity to ABT-199 in CML and NCB progenitors, and that high NCB BCL2 levels may explain the reported hematologic toxicities in ABT-199-treated patients. Also, while single agent ABT-199 has modest activity against CML progenitors, when combined with imatinib, ABT-199 significantly enhances imatinib activity against CML progenitors at concentrations predicted to avoid hematologic toxicities.","['Ko, Tun Kiat', 'Chuah, Charles T H', 'Huang, John W J', 'Ng, King-Pan', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Ko TK', 'Chuah CT', 'Huang JW', 'Ng KP', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.

The aim of the present study was to assess the apoptosis-inducing activity of AMP in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells and the associated underlying mechanism. A549 cells were incubated with different concentrations of AMP in culture medium. Cell growth and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and flow cytometry, respectively. In addition, western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to examine the time-dependent changes in protein expression. Certain changes in apoptotic protein expression were detected following exposure to AMP, including X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein release, reduced B-cell lymphoma 2, myeloid cell leukemia 1 and survivin expression levels, increased Bcl-2-associated X protein expression levels and cleaved-poly ADP ribose polymerase expression. The results revealed that AMP was a potent inhibitor of A549 cell proliferation. The c-Myc/S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) and histone deacetylase (HDAC)1/2 pathways were found to exert an important role in AMP-induced A549 cell apoptosis, as increased levels of c-Myc mRNA and reduced levels of c-Myc/Skp2 and HDAC1 and 2 proteins following AMP treatment were observed. The levels of F-box and WD repeat-containing protein 7alpha (Fbw7alpha), Fbw7beta, Fbw7gamma, phosphorylated-(p-)c-Myc (Thr58) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) proteins involved in c-Myc ubiquitin-dependent degradation were also analyzed. Following exposure to AMP, the expression levels of Fbw7alpha, Fbw7gamma and GSK3beta were reduced and p-c-Myc (Thr58) expression levels were increased. The results suggest that AMP exerts an anticancer effect, which is associated with the degradation of c-Myc, Skp2 and HDAC1 and 2. The ability of AMP to induce apoptosis independently of Fbwalpha and Fbw7gamma suggests a possible use in drug-resistant cancer associated with Fbw7 deficiency. Understanding the exact underlying mechanism requires further investigation of the association between c-Myc and Fbw7alpha/gamma reversal, and analysis of whether Thr58 phosphorylation of c-Myc is dependent on GSK3beta.","['Chen, Xin-Mei', 'Xie, Xian-Biao', 'Zhao, Qing', 'Wang, Fang', 'Bai, Yang', 'Yin, Jun-Qiang', 'Jiang, Hong', 'Xie, Xiao-Lin', 'Jia, Qiang', 'Huang, Gang']","['Chen XM', 'Xie XB', 'Zhao Q', 'Wang F', 'Bai Y', 'Yin JQ', 'Jiang H', 'Xie XL', 'Jia Q', 'Huang G']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Basic Science, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510182, P.R.

Herein, we report a female patient with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy (HAM)-like myelopathy following allo-SCT for ATL. CASE REPORT: She developed crural paresis 14 months after allo-SCT. Initially, she was diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) relapse of ATL and treated with intrathecal injection and whole brain and spine irradiation. Her symptoms recurred 5 months later, when a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen showed increased CD4 + CXCR3 + CCR4+ cell numbers and levels of neopterin and CXCL10 (IP-10). DISCUSSION: These results suggest the possible involvement of a certain immunological mechanism such as HAM in her symptoms, irrespective of the lack of anti-HTLV-I antibody in her CSF. Because a definitive diagnosis of CNS manifestation of ATL is sometimes difficult, multi-modal laboratory data are required for differential diagnosis.","['Kawamata, Toyotaka', 'Ohno, Nobuhiro', 'Sato, Kota', 'Kobayashi, Masayuki', 'Jo, Norihide', 'Yuji, Koichiro', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru']","['Kawamata T', 'Ohno N', 'Sato K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Jo N', 'Yuji K', 'Tanosaki R', 'Yamano Y', 'Tojo A', 'Uchimaru K']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan ; Division of Molecular Therapy, Department of The advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan ; Division of Molecular Therapy, Department of The advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Cellular Therapy, National Cancer Center Hospital, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045 Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University Graduate School of Medicine, Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8512 Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan ; Division of Molecular Therapy, Department of The advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639 Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141004,Switzerland,Springerplus,SpringerPlus,101597967,,,,2014/10/22 06:00,2014/10/22 06:01,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/2193-1801-3-581 [doi]', '1291 [pii]']",epublish,Springerplus. 2014 Oct 4;3:581. doi: 10.1186/2193-1801-3-581. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'CXCL10 (IP-10)', 'HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM)', 'Neopterin', 'Post-transplant myelopathy']",,PMC4197197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Log-rank test showed that 6 parameters including older age, higher white blood cell (WBC) counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bone marrow (BM) blasts at diagnosis, unfavorable risk cytogenetics, and non-mutated CEBPalpha were significant adverse prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) for elderly AML patients (P = 0.0013, 0.0358, 0.0132, 0.0242, 0.0236 and 0.0130, respectively). Moreover, older age and higher LDH were significant adverse predictors for relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.0447 and 0.0470, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed similar results for OS to those of the log-rank test and only higher LDH at diagnosis was a significant adverse predictor for RFS (P = 0.028, HR: 1.979, 95%CI: 1.075-3.644). In multivariate analysis, we identified 2 trends towards independent prognostic factors for OS, including BM blasts at diagnosis (P = 0.057, HR: 1.676, 95%CI: 0.984-2.854) and mutation status of CEBPalpha (P = 0.064, HR: 4.173, 95%CI: 0.918-18.966). Our data indicated that older age, gender and a previous history of hematologic diseases resulted in lower complete remission rate (P = 0.012, 0.051 and 0.086, respectively). We further developed an easy scoring system for predicting prognosis and response to induction therapy in older AML patients. Patients who had lower scores showed significantly longer OS and RFS (P = 0.0006 and 0.1001, respectively) and higher CR rate (P = 0.014).

Here we report four cases of HCL and all of them were without the classical clinical feature of splenomegaly. This is an observational study conducted between January 2013 to March 2014 where we could diagnose ten cases of HCL in Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Of these, four cases attracted attention because of absence of classical clinical features of HCL. Of the four cases, three presented with weakness/fatigability while fourth patient presented with recurrent respiratory tract infection. Surprising finding in these cases was absence of splenomegaly, both clinically and on imaging which demerit the suspicion of HCL clinically. All four had bi/pancytopenia and bone marrow examination coupled with immunophenotypic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of HCL. Three patients received chemotherapy with cladribine and achieved complete hematological remission. One patient did not receive chemotherapy due to poor general condition and was subsequently lost to follow up. To conclude, HCL can and do present without splenomegaly and this should not restrain one from suspecting HCL based on histomorphology which needs to be further confirmed by ancillary techniques. This finding in our series could be because these cases were picked early in their natural course of the disease. A high index of suspicion is essential for diagnosing and appropriately managing such cases.","['Venkatesan, S', 'Purohit, Abhishek', 'Aggarwal, Mukul', 'Manivannan, Prabhu', 'Tyagi, Seema', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Pati, Hara P', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Venkatesan S', 'Purohit A', 'Aggarwal M', 'Manivannan P', 'Tyagi S', 'Mahapatra M', 'Pati HP', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20140817,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,2014/10/22 06:00,2014/10/22 06:01,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-014-0442-9 [doi]', '442 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2014 Sep;30(Suppl 1):413-7. doi: 10.1007/s12288-014-0442-9.

Here, we report a case of FA with concomitant haemoglobin E-trait in a 5-year-old child who presented with weakness, epistaxis, malaena and intermittent fever. She had a hyper-pigmented patch over the nape of neck and polydactyly. Complete blood counts revealed pancytopenia. The bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy showed marrow hypoplasia. Chromosome analysis showed chromatid and chromosome breaks in 22 % cells suggestive of FA. The results were corroborated with MMC stress test.

Efforts to modify IFN dose and schedule have not improved efficacy. We sought to determine whether a shorter course of biochemotherapy would be more effective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: S0008 (S0008: Chemotherapy Plus Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Melanoma) was an Intergroup phase III trial that enrolled high-risk patients (stage IIIA-N2a through IIIC-N3), randomly assigning them to receive either HDI or biochemotherapy consisting of dacarbazine, cisplatin, vinblastine, interleukin-2, IFN alfa-2b (IFN-alpha-2b) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor given every 21 days for three cycles. Coprimary end points were relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In all, 432 patients were enrolled. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 57% and 7% of HDI patients and 36% and 40% of biochemotherapy patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 7.2 years, biochemotherapy improved RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.97; P = .015), with a median RFS of 4.0 years (95% CI, 1.9 years to not reached [NR]) versus 1.9 years for HDI (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8 years) and a 5-year RFS of 48% versus 39%. Median OS was not different (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.31; P = .55), with a median OS of 9.9 years (95% CI, 4.62 years to NR) for biochemotherapy versus 6.7 years (95% CI, 4.5 years to NR) for HDI and a 5-year OS of 56% for both arms. CONCLUSION: Biochemotherapy is a shorter, alternative adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk melanoma that provides statistically significant improvement in RFS but no difference in OS and more toxicity compared with HDI.","['Flaherty, Lawrence E', 'Othus, Megan', 'Atkins, Michael B', 'Tuthill, Ralph J', 'Thompson, John A', 'Vetto, John T', 'Haluska, Frank G', 'Pappo, Alberto S', 'Sosman, Jeffrey A', 'Redman, Bruce G', 'Moon, James', 'Ribas, Antoni', 'Kirkwood, John M', 'Sondak, Vernon K']","['Flaherty LE', 'Othus M', 'Atkins MB', 'Tuthill RJ', 'Thompson JA', 'Vetto JT', 'Haluska FG', 'Pappo AS', 'Sosman JA', 'Redman BG', 'Moon J', 'Ribas A', 'Kirkwood JM', 'Sondak VK']","[""Lawrence E.

PDGF-D also induces cellular transformation and promotes tumor growth. However, the functional role of PDGF-D in adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) has not been identified. Therefore, we primarily investigated the autocrine and paracrine roles of PDGF-D in this study. Furthermore, we identified the signaling pathways and the molecular mechanisms involved in PDGF-D-induced stimulation of ASCs. It is of interest that PDGF-B is not expressed, but PDGF-D and PDGF receptor-beta are expressed in ASCs. PDGF-D showed the strongest mitogenic effect on ASCs, and PDGF-D regulates the proliferation and migration of ASCs through the PI3K/Akt pathways. PDGF-D also increases the proliferation and migration of ASCs through generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and mitochondrial fission. mtROS generation and fission were mediated by p66Shc phosphorylation, and BCL2-related protein A1 and Serpine peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member 1 mediated the proliferation and migration of ASCs. In addition, PDGF-D upregulated the mRNA expression of diverse growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor A, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), FGF5, leukemia inhibitory factor, inhibin, beta A, interleukin 11, and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. Therefore, the preconditioning of PDGF-D enhanced the hair-regenerative potential of ASCs. PDGF-D-induced growth factor expression was attenuated by a pharmacological inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In summary, PDGF-D is highly expressed by ASCs, where it acts as a potent mitogenic factor. PDGF-D also upregulates growth factor expression in ASCs. Therefore, PDGF-D can be considered a novel ASC stimulator, and used as a preconditioning agent before ASC transplantation.","['Hye Kim, Ji', 'Gyu Park, Sang', 'Kim, Wang-Kyun', 'Song, Sun U', 'Sung, Jong-Hyuk']","['Hye Kim J', 'Gyu Park S', 'Kim WK', 'Song SU', 'Sung JH']","['College of Pharmacy, Yonsei University, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (PDGFD protein, human)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Dynamics/drug effects/physiology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism']",2014/10/22 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1865 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2015 Feb;33(2):542-56. doi: 10.1002/stem.1865.,['NOTNLM'],"['Adipose-derived stem cells', 'Mitochondrial ROS generation', 'Mitogenic effect', 'PDGF-D', 'Paracrine effect']",,,,,,['(c) 2014 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of BCR-ABL point mutations has been a great asset to furthering our understanding of a major cause of drug resistance, as has discovery of multidrug resistance proteins, dysregulation of signaling molecules downstream of BCR-ABL, and insights into the underlying causes of stromal-mediated chemoresistance. Such elucidation of mechanisms of resistance associated with leukemic cell survival is essential for the optimization of current therapies and enhancement of patient survival via delaying or preventing disease recurrence. Here, we present an overview of the use of nilotinib in combination with other agents against BCR-ABL-positive leukemia, as well as solid tumors, for the purpose of increasing clinical efficacy and overriding drug resistance.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Nonami, Atsushi', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Nonami A', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA, Ellen_Weisberg@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141021,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Point Mutation', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/10/22 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-014-1385-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2014 Dec;88(12):2233-42. doi: 10.1007/s00204-014-1385-5.

We performed RNA sequencing of 12 EVI1-r AMLs and compared the results with those of other AML subtypes (n = 139) and normal CD34(+) cells (n = 17). Results confirm high frequencies of RAS and other activated signaling mutations (10/12 AMLs) and identify new recurrent mutations in splicing factors (5/12 AMLs in SF3B1 and 2/12 AMLs in U2AF1), IKZF1 (3/12 AMLs), and TP53 (3/12 AMLs). Mutations in IKZF1, a gene located on chromosome 7, and monosomy 7 are mutually exclusive in this disease. Moreover IKZF1 expression is halved in monosomy 7 leukemias. EVI-r AMLs are also characterized by a unique transcriptional signature with high expression levels of MECOM, PREX2, VIP, MYCT1, and PAWR. Our results suggest that EVI1-r AMLs could be molecularly defined by specific transcriptomic anomalies and a hitherto unseen mutational pattern. Larger patient cohorts will better determine the frequency of these events.","['Lavallee, Vincent-Philippe', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', ""D'Angelo, Giovanni"", 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Lavallee VP', 'Gendron P', 'Lemieux S', ""D'Angelo G"", 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau G']","['The Leucegene Project at the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Computer Science and Operation Research, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'Banque de Cellules Leucemiques du Quebec, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; and.', 'The Leucegene Project at the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; Banque de Cellules Leucemiques du Quebec, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; and Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project at the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; Banque de Cellules Leucemiques du Quebec, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; and Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141020,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (MYCT1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PREX2 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (prostate apoptosis response-4 protein)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/genetics']",2014/10/22 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39536-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-07-591529 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 1;125(1):140-3. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-07-591529.

HHT treatment significantly increased apoptosis of K562 cells. Proteomic analyses indicated 32 differentially expressed proteins, 13 of which were identified by mass spectrometry (nine down-regulated and four up-regulated). Aside from alterations in apoptotic proteins and proteins associated with transcription and translation, our data also revealed changes in oxidative stress response and redox reaction-related proteins, such as heat shock proteins (Hsps), DJ-1 and thioredoxin. Specifically, these proteins were validated to decrease after HHT treatment in K562 cells and in primary CML cells by immunoblot analysis. Additionally, Hsps, DJ-1 and thioredoxin, which were also shown to decrease in primary cells from imatinib-resistant patients, may be promising potential targets for mechanistic research and new clinical treatments.","['Zhou, Xuan', 'Xu, Na', 'Li, Rong', 'Xiao, Yajuan', 'Gao, Guanlun', 'Lu, Qisi', 'Ding, Li', 'Li, Ling', 'Li, Yuling', 'Du, Qingfeng', 'Liu, Xiaoli']","['Zhou X', 'Xu N', 'Li R', 'Xiao Y', 'Gao G', 'Lu Q', 'Ding L', 'Li L', 'Li Y', 'Du Q', 'Liu X']",['Department of Hematology.'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150114,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/10/21 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.976818 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015 Jul;56(7):2162-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.976818.

In this study, based on an assumption that a strong candidate disease gene is more likely close to gene groups in which all members coordinately differentially express than individual genes with differential expression, we developed a novel disease gene prioritization method GroupRank by integrating gene co-expression and differential expression information generated from microarray data as well as PPI network. A candidate gene is ranked high using GroupRank if it is differentially expressed in disease and control or is close to differentially co-expressed groups in PPI network. We tested our method on data sets of lung, kidney, leukemia and breast cancer. The results revealed GroupRank could efficiently prioritize disease genes with significantly improved AUC value in comparison to the previous method with no consideration of co-expressed gene groups in PPI network. Moreover, the functional analyses of the major contributing gene group in gene prioritization of kidney cancer verified that our algorithm GroupRank not only ranks disease genes efficiently but also could help us identify and understand possible mechanisms in important physiological and pathological processes of disease.","['Wang, Qing', 'Zhang, Siyi', 'Pang, Shichao', 'Zhang, Menghuan', 'Wang, Bo', 'Liu, Qi', 'Li, Jing']","['Wang Q', 'Zhang S', 'Pang S', 'Zhang M', 'Wang B', 'Liu Q', 'Li J']","['Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America; Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.', 'Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Center for Bioinformation Technology, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141016,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Association Studies/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Protein Interaction Maps/*genetics']",2014/10/21 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0110406 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-03725 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 16;9(10):e110406. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0110406. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4199715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, through the generation of mouse models that affect its expression, c-Myb has been shown to be a key regulator of hematopoiesis, including having critical roles in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The precise function of c-Myb in HSCs although remains unclear. We have generated a novel c-myb allele in mice that allows direct observation of c-Myb protein levels in single cells. Using this reporter line we demonstrate that subtypes of HSCs can be isolated based upon their respective c-Myb protein expression levels. HSCs expressing low levels of c-Myb protein (c-Myb(low) HSC) appear to represent the most immature, dormant HSCs and they are a predominant component of HSCs that retain bromodeoxyuridine labeling. Hematopoietic stress, induced by 5-fluorouracil ablation, revealed that in this circumstance c-Myb-expressing cells become critical for multilineage repopulation. The discrimination of HSC subpopulations based on c-Myb protein levels is not reflected in the levels of c-myb mRNA, there being no more than a 1.3-fold difference comparing c-Myb(low) and c-Myb(high) HSCs. This illustrates how essential it is to include protein studies when aiming to understand the regulatory networks that control stem cell behavior.","['Sakamoto, Hiroshi', 'Takeda, Naoki', 'Arai, Fumio', 'Hosokawa, Kentaro', 'Garcia, Paloma', 'Suda, Toshio', 'Frampton, Jon', 'Ogawa, Minetaro']","['Sakamoto H', 'Takeda N', 'Arai F', 'Hosokawa K', 'Garcia P', 'Suda T', 'Frampton J', 'Ogawa M']","['Department of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto City, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2014/10/21 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1855 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2015 Feb;33(2):479-90. doi: 10.1002/stem.1855.,['NOTNLM'],"['Animals', 'Cell proliferation', 'Genetically modified', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Proto-oncogene proteins c-myb']","['G0501688/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K01076X/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,['(c) 2014 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Innate resistance can be induced by secreted bone marrow stromal cytokines and growth factors (BMSFs) that protect CML-LSCs from TKIs, resulting in minimal residual disease. Developing strategies to eradicate innate TKI resistance in LSCs is critical for preventing disease relapse. Cancer cells balance reactive oxygen species (ROS) at higher than normal levels, promoting their proliferation and survival, but also making them susceptible to damage by ROS-generating agents. Bcr-Abl increases cellular ROS levels, which can be reduced with TKI inhibitors, whereas, BMSFs increase ROS levels. We hypothesized that BMSF-mediated increases in ROS would trigger ROS damage in TKI-treated CML-LSCs when exposed to chaetocin, a mycotoxin that imposes oxidative stress by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase-1. Here, we showed that chaetocin suppressed viability and colony formation, and induced apoptosis of the murine hematopoietic cell line TonB210 with and without Bcr-Abl expression, and these effects were potentiated by BMSFs. In contrast, imatinib activities in Bcr-Abl-positive TonB210 cells were inhibited by BMSFs. Further, BMSFs did not inhibit imatinib activities when TonB210 cells expressing Bcr-Abl were cotreated with chaetocin. Chaetocin showed similar activities against LSC-enriched CML cell populations isolated from a murine transplant model of CML blast crisis that were phenotypically negative for lineage markers and positive for Sca-1 and c-Kit (CML-LSK). BMSFs and chaetocin increased ROS in CML-LSK cells and addition of BMSFs and chaetocin resulted in higher levels compared with chaetocin or BMSF treatment alone. Pretreatment of CML-LSKs with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked chaetocin cytotoxicity, even in the presence of BMSFs, demonstrating the importance ROS for chaetocin activities. Chaetocin effects on self-renewal of CML-LSKs were assessed by transplanting CML-LSKs into secondary recipients following ex vivo exposure to chaetocin, in the presence or absence of BMSFs. Disease latency in mice transplanted with CML-LSKs following chaetocin treatment more than doubled compared with untreated CML-LSKs or BMSFs-treated CML-LSKs. Mice transplanted with CML-LSKs following chaetocin treatment in the presence of BMSFs had significantly extended survival time compared with mice transplanted with CML-LSKs treated with chaetocin alone. Our findings indicate that chaetocin activity against CML-LSKs is significantly enhanced in the presence of BMSFs and suggest that chaetocin may be effective as a codrug to complement TKIs in CML treatment by disrupting the innate resistance of CML-LSKs through an ROS dependent mechanism.","['Truitt, L', 'Hutchinson, C', 'DeCoteau, J F', 'Geyer, C R']","['Truitt L', 'Hutchinson C', 'DeCoteau JF', 'Geyer CR']","['1] Cancer Stem Cell Research Group, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada [2] Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.', '1] Cancer Stem Cell Research Group, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada [2] Department of Biochemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.', '1] Cancer Stem Cell Research Group, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada [2] Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.', '1] Cancer Stem Cell Research Group, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada [2] Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada [3] Department of Biochemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141020,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,2014/10/21 06:00,2014/10/21 06:01,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/21 06:01 [medline]']","['oncsis201437 [pii]', '10.1038/oncsis.2014.37 [doi]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2014 Oct 20;3:e122. doi: 10.1038/oncsis.2014.37.,,,,PMC4216903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In BRAF WT cells and those with mutations that activate or result in high levels of the BRAF activator RAS, BRAF inhibition can lead to ERK activation, resulting in tumorigenic transformation. We describe a patient with malignant melanoma who developed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the absence of RAS mutations during vemurafenib treatment. BRAF inhibition promoted patient CLL proliferation in culture and in murine xenografts and activated MEK/ERK in primary CLL cells from additional patients. BRAF inhibitor-driven ERK activity and CLL proliferation required B cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation, as inhibition of the BCR-proximal spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) reversed ERK hyperactivation and proliferation of CLL cells from multiple patients, while inhibition of the BCR-distal Bruton tyrosine kinase had no effect. Additionally, the RAS-GTP/RAS ratio in primary CLL cells exposed to vemurafenib was reduced upon SYK inhibition. BRAF inhibition increased mortality and CLL expansion in mice harboring CLL xenografts; however, SYK or MEK inhibition prevented CLL proliferation and increased animal survival. Together, these results suggest that BRAF inhibitors promote B cell malignancies in the absence of obvious mutations in RAS or other receptor tyrosine kinases and provide a rationale for combined BRAF/MEK or BRAF/SYK inhibition.","['Yaktapour, Niuscha', 'Meiss, Frank', 'Mastroianni, Justin', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Andrlova, Hana', 'Mathew, Nimitha R', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Hutter, Barbara', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Brors, Benedikt', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Pantic, Milena', 'Bartsch, Ingrid', 'Spehl, Timo S', 'Meyer, Philipp T', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Zirlik, Katja', 'Brummer, Tilman', 'Zeiser, Robert']","['Yaktapour N', 'Meiss F', 'Mastroianni J', 'Zenz T', 'Andrlova H', 'Mathew NR', 'Claus R', 'Hutter B', 'Frohling S', 'Brors B', 'Pfeifer D', 'Pantic M', 'Bartsch I', 'Spehl TS', 'Meyer PT', 'Duyster J', 'Zirlik K', 'Brummer T', 'Zeiser R']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141020,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '207SMY3FQT (Vemurafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Syk Kinase', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vemurafenib']",2014/10/21 06:00,2015/03/03 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['76539 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI76539 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2014 Nov;124(11):5074-84. doi: 10.1172/JCI76539.

The clathrin assembly role of AP180 is mediated by a long disordered C-terminal assembly domain. Within this assembly domain, a central acidic clathrin and adapter binding (CLAP) sub-domain contains all of the known short binding motifs for clathrin and AP2.

The lineage-determining factor MyoD is bound to myogenic genes at the onset of differentiation whether gene activation is immediate or delayed. How temporal regulation of differentiation-specific genes is established remains unclear. RESULTS: Using embryonic tissue, we addressed the molecular differences in the organization of the myogenin and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) gene promoters by examining regulatory factor binding as a function of both time and spatial organization during somitogenesis. At the myogenin promoter, binding of the homeodomain factor Pbx1 coincided with H3 hyperacetylation and was followed by binding of co-activators that modulate chromatin structure. MyoD and myogenin binding occurred subsequently, demonstrating that Pbx1 facilitates chromatin remodeling and modification before myogenic regulatory factor binding. At the same time, the MCK promoter was bound by HDAC2 and MyoD, and activating histone marks were largely absent. The association of HDAC2 and MyoD was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay (PLA), and sequential ChIP. CONCLUSIONS: MyoD differentially promotes activated and repressed chromatin structures at myogenic genes early after the onset of skeletal muscle differentiation in the developing mouse embryo.","['Cho, Ok Hyun', 'Mallappa, Chandrashekara', 'Hernandez-Hernandez, J Manuel', 'Rivera-Perez, Jaime A', 'Imbalzano, Anthony N']","['Cho OH', 'Mallappa C', 'Hernandez-Hernandez JM', 'Rivera-Perez JA', 'Imbalzano AN']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141103,United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (MyoD1 myogenic differentiation protein)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Hdac2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Muscle Development/*physiology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/cytology/*embryology', 'MyoD Protein/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics']",2014/10/21 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dvdy.24217 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2015 Jan;244(1):43-55. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.24217.

BIO administered to immunocompromised mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells inhibited human stem cell engraftment in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood. BIO reduced CD34(+) progenitor cells in the BM, and primitive lymphoid progenitors re-populated host thymus at later stages post-transplant. The development of all T-cell subsets in the thymus was suppressed in BIO-treated mice. Human cell engraftment was gradually restored after discontinuation of BIO treatment; however, T-cell depletion remained until the end of experiment, which correlated with the attenuated thymic function in the host. BIO delayed CD34(+) cell expansion in stroma-supported or cytokine-only cultures. BIO treatment delayed progenitor cell divisions and induced apoptosis in cultures with sub-optimal cytokine support. In addition, BIO inhibited B- and T-cell development in co-cultures with MS5 and OP9-DL1 BM stroma cells, respectively.

A rationally designed scaffold should allow for encapsulated cells to survive, adhere, proliferate, remodel the niche, and can be used for controlled delivery of biomolecules. Here we report a microarray of composite bioadhesive microgels with modular dimensions, tunable mechanical properties and bulk modified adhesive biomolecule composition. Composite bioadhesive microgels of maleimide functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG-MAL) with interpenetrating network (IPN) of gelatin ionically cross-linked with silicate nanoparticles were engineered by integrating microfabrication with Michael-type addition chemistry and ionic gelation. By encapsulating clinically relevant anchorage-dependent cervical cancer cells and suspension leukemia cells as cell culture models in these composite microgels, we demonstrate enhanced cell spreading, survival, and metabolic activity compared to control gels. The composite bioadhesive hydrogels represent a platform that could be used to study independent effect of stiffness and adhesive ligand density on cell survival and function. We envision that such microarrays of cell adhesive microenvironments, which do not require harsh chemical and UV crosslinking conditions, will provide a more efficacious cell culture platform that can be used to study cell behavior and survival, function as building blocks to fabricate 3D tissue structures, cell delivery systems, and high throughput drug screening devices.","['Patel, Ravi Ghanshyam', 'Purwada, Alberto', 'Cerchietti, Leandro', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Gaharwar, Akhilesh K', 'Singh, Ankur']","['Patel RG', 'Purwada A', 'Cerchietti L', 'Inghirami G', 'Melnick A', 'Gaharwar AK', 'Singh A']","['Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA ; Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA.', 'Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Mol Bioeng,Cellular and molecular bioengineering,101468590,,,,2014/10/21 06:00,2014/10/21 06:01,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12195-014-0353-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Bioeng. 2014 Sep 1;7(3):394-408. doi: 10.1007/s12195-014-0353-8.,['NOTNLM'],"['Bioadhesive', 'Cancer', 'Cell adhesive', 'Composite hydrogels', 'Leukemia', 'Michael-type addition', 'Microgels']",['R21 CA185236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4196273,['NIHMS620004'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosome instability (CIN), which is often mutually exclusive from hypermutation genotypes, represents a distinct subtype of genome instability. Hypermutations in cancer cells are due to defects in DNA repair genes, but the cause of CIN is still elusive. However, because of the extensive chromosomal abnormalities associated with CIN, its cause is likely a defect in a network of genes that regulate mitotic checkpoints and chromosomal organization and segregation. Emerging evidence has shown that the chromosomal decatenation checkpoint, which is critical for chromatin untangling and packing during genetic material duplication, is defective in cancer cells with CIN. The decatenation checkpoint is known to be regulated by a family of enzymes called topoisomerases. Among them, the gene encoding topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) is commonly altered at both gene copy number and gene expression level in cancer cells. Thus, abnormal alterations of TOP2A, its interacting proteins, and its modifications may have a critical role in CIN in human cancers. Clinically, a large arsenal of topoisomerase inhibitors has been used to suppress DNA replication in cancer. However, they often lead to the secondary development of leukemia because of their effect on the chromosomal decatenation checkpoint. Therefore, topoisomerase drugs must be used judiciously and administered on an individual basis. In this review, we highlight the biological function of TOP2A in chromosome segregation and the mechanisms that regulate this enzyme's expression and activity. We also review the roles of TOP2A and related proteins in human cancers, and raise a perspective for how to target TOP2A in personalized cancer therapy.","['Chen, T', 'Sun, Y', 'Ji, P', 'Kopetz, S', 'Zhang, W']","['Chen T', 'Sun Y', 'Ji P', 'Kopetz S', 'Zhang W']","['1] Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Department of Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141020,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*physiology', '*Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosome Segregation/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Precision Medicine/*methods', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",2014/10/21 06:00,2015/10/22 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014332 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.332 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Jul 30;34(31):4019-31. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.332.

The aim of this prospective registry study was to assess the host and CVC-related risk factors for blood stream infections (BSIs). PROCEDURE: Patients undergoing CVC insertion for chemotherapy were followed prospectively for CVC complications. At the time of enrollment demographic-, clinical- and CVC-related data were collected. Survival and Cox-regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 423 CVCs were inserted into 262 patients for a total of 76,540 catheter-days. The incidence of BSIs was 1.95 per 1,000 patient-days (95% CI 1.66-2.29). Myeloid leukemia and younger age were associated with higher risk for BSI. At least one BSI occurred in 187 CVCs with an incidence of 2.84 per 1,000 catheter-days (95% CI 2.47-3.24). Externalized CVCs, that is, tunneled externalized catheters and peripheral inserted central catheters, were associated with higher risk for BSI in the group of diseases with relatively lower rate of infection. However, in diseases with high rate of infection no such association was found. The type of BSI was associated with the diagnosis and the CVC type. CVC occlusion was associated with higher risk for recurrent BSI and for coagulase negative staph BSI. CONCLUSIONS: Both patient and CVC-related factors are associated with higher risk of BSI in children receiving chemotherapy. The results of this study could be used in developing studies aiming to reduce the rate of BSIs in children with cancer.","['Yacobovich, Joanne', 'Ben-Ami, Tal', 'Abdalla, Tameemi', 'Tamary, Hannah', 'Goldstein, Gal', 'Weintraub, Michael', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Toren, Amos', 'Kenet, Gili', 'Revel-Vilk, Shoshana']","['Yacobovich J', 'Ben-Ami T', 'Abdalla T', 'Tamary H', 'Goldstein G', 'Weintraub M', 'Yaniv I', 'Toren A', 'Kenet G', 'Revel-Vilk S']","[""Hematology/Oncology Center, Schneider Children's Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141018,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Central Venous Catheters/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*epidemiology/*etiology']",2014/10/21 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25281 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Mar;62(3):471-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25281.

It was found by the methods such as western blot and flow cytometry (FCM), that G. lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) blocked the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/MAPK signaling pathway, simultaneously activated p38 and JNK MAPK pathways, and therefore regulated their downstream genes and proteins, including p53, c-myc, c-fos, c-jun, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cyclin D1. As a result, cycle arrest and apoptosis of HL-60 cells were induced. Therefore, GLP exerted anti-tumor activity via MAPK pathways in HL-60 acute leukemia cells.","['Yang, Guohua', 'Yang, Lei', 'Zhuang, Yun', 'Qian, Xifeng', 'Shen, Yunfeng']","['Yang G', 'Yang L', 'Zhuang Y', 'Qian X', 'Shen Y']","[""a Department of Hematology, Wu Xi People's Hospital , Nanjing Medical University , Wuxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Wu Xi People's Hospital , Nanjing Medical University , Wuxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Wu Xi People's Hospital , Nanjing Medical University , Wuxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Wu Xi People's Hospital , Nanjing Medical University , Wuxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Wu Xi People's Hospital , Nanjing Medical University , Wuxi , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141020,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polysaccharides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Reishi/*chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2014/10/21 06:00,2016/10/26 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10799893.2014.970275 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2016;36(1):6-13. doi: 10.3109/10799893.2014.970275.

Risk in the absence of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >/=500/microl) is not well defined. PROCEDURE: In a retrospective cohort of febrile (temperature >/=38.0 degrees for >1 hr or >/=38.3 degrees ) pediatric oncology patients with ANC >/=500/microl, a diagnostic prediction model for BSI was constructed using logistic regression modeling and the following candidate predictors: age, ANC, absolute monocyte count, body temperature, inpatient/outpatient presentation, sex, central venous catheter type, hypotension, chills, cancer diagnosis, stem cell transplant, upper respiratory symptoms, and exposure to cytarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin, or anti-GD2 antibody. The model was internally validated with bootstrapping methods. RESULTS: Among 932 febrile episodes in 463 patients, we identified 91 cases of BSI. Independently significant predictors for BSI were higher body temperature (Odds ratio [OR] 2.36 P < 0.001), tunneled external catheter (OR 13.79 P < 0.001), peripherally inserted central catheter (OR 3.95 P = 0.005), elevated ANC (OR 1.19 P = 0.024), chills (OR 2.09 P = 0.031), and hypotension (OR 3.08 P = 0.004). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosis (OR 0.34 P = 0.026), increased age (OR 0.70 P = 0.049), and drug exposure (OR 0.08 P < 0.001) were associated with decreased risk for BSI. The risk prediction model had a C-index of 0.898; after bootstrapping adjustment for optimism, corrected C-index 0.885. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a diagnostic prediction model for BSI in febrile pediatric oncology patients without severe neutropenia. External validation is warranted before use in clinical practice.

Review of the neuropathological autopsy documentations at the Markusovszky University Teaching Hospital (1964-2014)].,1722-8,10.1556/OH.2014.29996 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Nearly 6000 autoptic studies were carried out during the last 50 years at the Laboratory of Neuropathology, Markusovszky University Teaching Hospital, Hungary. AIM: The aim of the authors was to present those previously frequent and often fatal conditions that can be prevented or treated today. METHOD: Retrospective analyses of the neuropathological documentations. RESULTS: Measles-related subacute sclerosing panencephalitis caused death in 13 cases, the last occurred in 1991. The mandatory vaccination against the causative virus has eliminated this severe neurological complication. Fourteen lives were lost due to herpes simplex encephalitis, including the last case seen in 1999. Feasibility of early diagnosis and the availability of acyclovir therapy resulted in better outcome without fatality. Tuberculous meningitis still occurred in most recent years, although only sporadically. Recognition of this condition is not straightforward due to its rarity, and considerations for this disease are often omitted from the routine differential diagnosis. The generally low mortality rates in tick borne encephalitis further dropped after the introduction of vaccination. Altogether only 8 such cases were documented. The last fatal cases of neurolues were seen in the 1990s. However, syphilis itself has not disappeared, and the number of cases with newly acquired infection continues to rise. The introduction of intrathecal methotrexate and radiotherapy made possible the prevention or effective treatment of meningeal leukosis. A careful coordination of these treatment modalities, however, is important as nervous system complications may develop in the form of disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy that is also reflected in the records. CONCLUSIONS: The 50-year neuropathology documentation reflects changes in the occurrence of diseases, and it calls attention to those disorders which can be prevented or treated today, but may represent diagnostic challenges.","['Garzuly, Ferenc', 'Schneider, Ferenc', 'Ivanyi, Janos Laszlo', 'Nagy, Zsuzsanna', 'Varga, Mariann', 'Suto, Krisztian', 'Tolvaj, Balazs', 'Kalman, Bernadette']","['Garzuly F', 'Schneider F', 'Ivanyi JL', 'Nagy Z', 'Varga M', 'Suto K', 'Tolvaj B', 'Kalman B']","['Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Patologiai Osztaly Szombathely Markusovszky u. 5. 9700.', 'Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Infektologiai Osztaly Szombathely.', 'Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Haematologiai es Haemosztazeologiai Osztaly Szombathely.', 'Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Neurologiai Osztaly Szombathely.', 'Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Borgyogyaszati Osztaly Szombathely.', 'Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Kozponti Aneszteziologiai es Intenziv Betegellato Osztaly Szombathely.', 'Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Patologiai Osztaly Szombathely Markusovszky u. 5. 9700.', 'Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Kutatasi es Oktatasi Centrum Szombathely Pecsi Tudomany Egyetem Egeszsegtudomanyi Kar Pecs.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,,IM,"['*Autopsy', '*Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Hungary', 'Medical Records', 'Nervous System Diseases/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2014/10/21 06:00,2015/03/27 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['A680KN5736643749 [pii]', '10.1556/OH.2014.29996 [doi]']",ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2014 Oct 26;155(43):1722-8. doi: 10.1556/OH.2014.29996.,['NOTNLM'],"['changing occurrence of diseases', 'idegrendszeri fertozesek', 'leukaemias szovodmenyek', 'nervous system complications of leukemia', 'neuroinfections', 'neuropathology', 'neuropatologia', 'valtozo elofordulas']",,,,Valtozo idok - valtozo betegsegek.

The protocol LLA 15-30 for patients between 15 and 30 years with Ph(-)ALL, based on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol AALL0232 resulting in a five years DFS of 78%, was started in 2007 by the PANDA national program. AIM: To report the results of the prospective cohort study evaluating the results of this protocol four years after its implementation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2007 and December 2010, 68 Ph(-) ALL patients, aged between 15-30 years (75% males) were incorporated. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. RESULTS: Fifty percent of patients were of high risk. A complete response was achieved in 91%, early death occurred in 6% and induction failure in 3%. Median follow-up was 23 months. Overall survival, disease free survival and relapse rates at 35 months were 61.8, 67.5% and 31% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LLA 15-30 protocol significantly improved three-year overall survival from 31 to 62%. The 20% difference observed with AALL0232 protocol is explained by the high rate of relapse. Improving provider and patient compliance with protocols may eliminate this gap.","['Puga, Barbara', 'Guerra, Carolina', 'Molina, Javiera', 'Cabrera, Maria Elena', 'Pilleux, Lilian', 'Calderon, Susana', 'Rojas, Christine', 'Vergara, Carmen Gloria', 'Rojas, Hernan', 'Munoz, Lina', 'Lois, Vivianne', 'Aspillaga, Augusto', 'Pizarro, Alvaro']","['Puga B', 'Guerra C', 'Molina J', 'Cabrera ME', 'Pilleux L', 'Calderon S', 'Rojas C', 'Vergara CG', 'Rojas H', 'Munoz L', 'Lois V', 'Aspillaga A', 'Pizarro A']",,['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/21 06:00,2015/05/16 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2013/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-98872014000600004 [pii]', '10.4067/S0034-98872014000600004 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2014 Jun;142(6):707-15. doi: 10.4067/S0034-98872014000600004.,,,,,,"Leucemia linfoblastica aguda estirpe B Philadelphia negativa en adolescentes y adultos jovenes: Resultados del Protocolo Terapeutico LLA 15-30, Programa Nacional de Cancer del Adulto (PANDA), Ministerio de Salud, Chile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 and/or CDK4/6 are currently under development. A more complete and quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of action of FLT3 and CDK4/6 inhibitors may better inform the development of current and future compounds that act on one or both of the molecular targets, and thus may lead to improved treatments for AML. In this study, we investigated in both subcutaneous and orthotopic AML mouse models, the mechanisms of action of three FLT3 and/or CDK4/6 inhibitors: AMG925 (Amgen), sorafenib (Bayer and Onyx), and quizartinib (Ambit Biosciences). A composite model was developed to integrate the plasma pharmacokinetics of these three compounds on their respective molecular targets, the coupling between the target pathways, as well as the resulting effects on tumor burden reduction in the subcutaneous xenograft model. A sequential modeling approach was used, wherein model structures and estimated parameters from upstream processes (e.g. PK, cellular signaling) were fixed for modeling subsequent downstream processes (cellular signaling, tumor burden). Pooled data analysis was employed for the plasma PK and cellular signaling modeling, while population modeling was applied to the tumor burden modeling. The resulting model allows the decomposition of the relative contributions of FLT3(ITD) and CDK4/6 inhibition on downstream signaling and tumor burden. In addition, the action of AMG925 on cellular signaling and tumor burden was further studied in an orthotopic tumor mouse model more closely representing the physiologically relevant environment for AML.","['Zhang, Yaping', 'Hsu, Cheng-Pang', 'Lu, Jian-Feng', 'Kuchimanchi, Mita', 'Sun, Yu-Nien', 'Ma, Ji', 'Xu, Guifen', 'Zhang, Yilong', 'Xu, Yang', 'Weidner, Margaret', 'Huard, Justin', ""D'Argenio, David Z""]","['Zhang Y', 'Hsu CP', 'Lu JF', 'Kuchimanchi M', 'Sun YN', 'Ma J', 'Xu G', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Weidner M', 'Huard J', ""D'Argenio DZ""]","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141019,United States,J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn,Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,101096520,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sorafenib', 'Tumor Burden/*drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2014/10/20 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/10/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10928-014-9393-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn. 2014 Dec;41(6):675-91. doi: 10.1007/s10928-014-9393-x.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a unique resource for comprehensive discovery of mutations and genes in blood that may contribute to the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here, we analyzed blood-derived sequence data from 2,728 individuals from TCGA and discovered 77 blood-specific mutations in cancer-associated genes, the majority being associated with advanced age. Remarkably, 83% of these mutations were from 19 leukemia and/or lymphoma-associated genes, and nine were recurrently mutated (DNMT3A, TET2, JAK2, ASXL1, TP53, GNAS, PPM1D, BCORL1 and SF3B1). We identified 14 additional mutations in a very small fraction of blood cells, possibly representing the earliest stages of clonal expansion in hematopoietic stem cells. Comparison of these findings to mutations in hematological malignancies identified several recurrently mutated genes that may be disease initiators. Our analyses show that the blood cells of more than 2% of individuals (5-6% of people older than 70 years) contain mutations that may represent premalignant events that cause clonal hematopoietic expansion.","['Xie, Mingchao', 'Lu, Charles', 'Wang, Jiayin', 'McLellan, Michael D', 'Johnson, Kimberly J', 'Wendl, Michael C', 'McMichael, Joshua F', 'Schmidt, Heather K', 'Yellapantula, Venkata', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Ozenberger, Bradley A', 'Welch, John S', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Dipersio, John F', 'Chen, Feng', 'Wilson, Richard K', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Ding, Li']","['Xie M', 'Lu C', 'Wang J', 'McLellan MD', 'Johnson KJ', 'Wendl MC', 'McMichael JF', 'Schmidt HK', 'Yellapantula V', 'Miller CA', 'Ozenberger BA', 'Welch JS', 'Link DC', 'Walter MJ', 'Mardis ER', 'Dipersio JF', 'Chen F', 'Wilson RK', 'Ley TJ', 'Ding L']","['1] The Genome Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.

Through genome-wide analysis of U2AF-RNA interactions, we report that U2AF has the capacity to directly define ~88% of functional 3' splice sites in the human genome, but numerous U2AF binding events also occur in intronic locations. Mechanistic dissection reveals that upstream intronic binding events interfere with the immediate downstream 3' splice site associated either with the alternative exon, to cause exon skipping, or with the competing constitutive exon, to induce exon inclusion. We further demonstrate partial functional impairment with leukemia-associated mutations in U2AF35, but not U2AF65, in regulated splicing. These findings reveal the genomic function and regulatory mechanism of U2AF in both normal and disease states.","['Shao, Changwei', 'Yang, Bo', 'Wu, Tongbin', 'Huang, Jie', 'Tang, Peng', 'Zhou, Yu', 'Zhou, Jie', 'Qiu, Jinsong', 'Jiang, Li', 'Li, Hairi', 'Chen, Geng', 'Sun, Hui', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Denise, Alain', 'Zhang, Dong-Er', 'Fu, Xiang-Dong']","['Shao C', 'Yang B', 'Wu T', 'Huang J', 'Tang P', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhou J', 'Qiu J', 'Jiang L', 'Li H', 'Chen G', 'Sun H', 'Zhang Y', 'Denise A', 'Zhang DE', 'Fu XD']","['State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Institut de Genetique et Microbiologie I, Universite Paris-Sud and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Orsay, France.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Institut de Genetique et Microbiologie I, Universite Paris-Sud and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Orsay, France.', 'UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141019,United States,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Nature structural & molecular biology,101186374,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)', '0 (U2AF2 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Exons', '*Genome, Human', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*RNA Splice Sites', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Splicing Factor U2AF']",2014/10/20 06:00,2015/01/07 06:00,['2014/10/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/nsmb.2906 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2014 Nov;21(11):997-1005. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.2906.

However, there have been no data available about the efficacy of Tac QD conversion from intravenous Tac (Tac i.v.) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). We analyzed the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tac QD in allo-SCT recipients. A total of 10 patients with hematological malignancies who received allo-SCT from unrelated donors were enrolled. Patients received Tac i.v. at 0.03 mg/kg a day before transplantation. Administration of Tac i.v. was converted to Tac QD at a 1:4 ratio when the patients had recovered from regimen-related gastrointestinal toxicity and could tolerate oral medication. After conversion, six out of 10 patients (60 %) showed a sustained decrease in Tac exposure and required dose adjustment. The conversion from Tac i.v. to Tac QD should be performed under close medical supervision. Area under the curve (AUC) and the trough of Tac QD showed a correlation, and the trough should be maintained above 7.5 ng/ml to provide an adequate AUC. Although four patients received bone marrow from an HLA DRB1 1 antigen-mismatched unrelated donor, no patients developed grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The modification of Tac QD to maintain a whole-blood trough concentration above 7.5 ng/ml may be as effective as Tac BID.","['Yano, Shingo', 'Mori, Shinichiro', 'Saito, Takeshi', 'Yokoyama, Hiroki', 'Machishima, Tomohito', 'Shimada, Takaki', 'Yahagi, Yuichi', 'Sugiyama, Katsuki', 'Ogasawara, Yoji', 'Takahara, Shinobu', 'Kasama, Kinuyo', 'Katsube, Atsushi', 'Kamiyama, Yutaro', 'Suzuki, Kazuhito', 'Inui, Yumiko', 'Usui, Noriko', 'Aiba, Keisuke', 'Yamashita, Takuya']","['Yano S', 'Mori S', 'Saito T', 'Yokoyama H', 'Machishima T', 'Shimada T', 'Yahagi Y', 'Sugiyama K', 'Ogasawara Y', 'Takahara S', 'Kasama K', 'Katsube A', 'Kamiyama Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Inui Y', 'Usui N', 'Aiba K', 'Yamashita T']","['Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi Shinbashi, Minatoku, Tokyo, 105-8461, Japan, yano@jikei.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141019,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/therapy', 'Tacrolimus/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/19 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/10/19 06:00'],"['2014/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2233-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Mar;94(3):491-6. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2233-7.

T-cell-replete HLA-haploidentical HSCT has remarkable anti-leukemia/tumor effects on these patients, but also a high risk of severe/extensive graft-versus-host disease (GHVD). Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCY) is regarded as a GVHD-specific immunosuppressant in adults, but its feasibility is unknown in children. METHODS: We performed a prospective feasibility study of PTCY at 50 mg/kg on day 3 for children with advanced leukemias or malignant solid tumors: refractory to chemotherapy or relapsed after conventional allogeneic HSCT. Conditioning consisted of fludarabine (180 mg/m2) and melphalan (140-210 mg/m2). RESULTS: Long-term engraftments were achieved in 11 patients (73.3%) after bone marrow transplantation (BMT, n = 13) or peripheral blood (PB) stem cell transplantation (n = 2). The incidence of severe acute GHVD was 25.0% and that of extensive chronic GVHD 0.0% after evaluable BMT. CR was achieved in 6/15 and partial response in 4/15 as the best response. Finally, 11/15 experienced disease progression/relapse, 2/15 suffered treatment-related mortality without evidence of disease, and 2/15 are alive in continuous CR. CONCLUSIONS: PTCY is feasible in children; however, for a better outcome in such patients with advanced malignancies, some modifications are anticipated.","['Sawada, Akihisa', 'Shimizu, Mariko', 'Isaka, Kanako', 'Higuchi, Kouhei', 'Mayumi, Azusa', 'Yoshimoto, Yuri', 'Kikuchi, Hiroaki', 'Kondo, Osamu', 'Koyama-Sato, Maho', 'Yasui, Masahiro', 'Kawa, Keisei', 'Inoue, Masami']","['Sawada A', 'Shimizu M', 'Isaka K', 'Higuchi K', 'Mayumi A', 'Yoshimoto Y', 'Kikuchi H', 'Kondo O', 'Koyama-Sato M', 'Yasui M', 'Kawa K', 'Inoue M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health , Izumi City, Osaka , Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20141017,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Haploidy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/complications/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/blood/complications/therapy', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2014/10/18 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2014.961214 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Nov;31(8):754-64. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2014.961214.

The ALL202-U protocol was conducted to examine the efficacy and feasibility of a pediatric protocol in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with BCR-ABL-negative ALL. Patients aged 15-24 years (n=139) were treated with the same protocol used for pediatric B-ALL. The primary objective of this study was to assess the disease-free survival (DFS) rate and its secondary aims were to assess toxicity, the complete remission (CR) rate and the overall survival (OS) rate. The CR rate was 94%. The 5-year DFS and OS rates were 67% (95% confidence interval (CI) 58-75%) and 73% (95% CI 64-80%), respectively.

Although there have been a number of attempts to apply NK cells for cancer therapy, clinical application has been somewhat limited because of the difficulty in preparing a sufficient number of NK cells. Therefore, ex vivo NK cell expansion is one of the important steps for developing NK cell therapeutics. METHODS: CD3(+) depleted lymphocytes were cocultured with IL-2 and with feeder cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs], K562, and Jurkat) for 15 days. Expanded NK cells were tested for cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines. RESULTS: We compared feeder activities of three different cells-PBMC, K562, and Jurkat. K562 expanded NK cells by almost 20 fold and also showed powerful cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. K562-NK cells remarkably expressed the NK cell activation receptors, NKG2D, and DNAM-1. K562-NK cells exhibited more than two-fold production of cytotoxic granules compared with Jurkat-NK cells, producing more perforin and granzyme B than naive NK cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that K562 are more efficient feeder cells than Jurkat or PBMCs. K562 feeder cells expanded NK cells by almost 20 fold and showed powerful cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. We herein propose an intriguing approach for a design of NK cell expansion.","['Bae, Duk Seong', 'Lee, Jae Kwon']","['Bae DS', 'Lee JK']","['Department of Biology Education, College of Education, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea.', 'Department of Biology Education, College of Education, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140925,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,2014/10/18 06:00,2014/10/18 06:01,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2014.49.3.154 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2014 Sep;49(3):154-61. doi: 10.5045/br.2014.49.3.154.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2011, 28 patients, aged less than 18 years, were treated with TBI-based conditioning for allo-SCT in our institution. Of the 28 patients, 21 patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 75%) and 7 were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 25%). TBI was completed 4 days or 1 day before stem cell infusion. Patients underwent radiation therapy with bilateral parallel opposing fields and 6-MV X-rays. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival outcomes. RESULTS: The 2-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 66% and 56%, respectively (71.4% and 60.0% in AML patients vs. 64.3% and 52.4% in ALL patients, respectively). Treatment related mortality rate were 25%. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease was a major complication; other complications included endocrine dysfunction and pulmonary complications. Common complications from TBI were nausea (89%) and cataracts (7.1%). CONCLUSION: The efficacy and toxicity data in this study of TBI-based conditioning to pediatric acute leukemia patients were comparable with previous studies.

The enzymes acquire neomorphic enzymatic activity when they mutated. METHODS: We have investigated the frequency and outcome of the acquired IDH1/IDH2 mutations and the IDH1 SNP 105C > T (rs11554137) in 189 unselected de novo AML patients by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by direct sequencing. The survival are presented in Kaplan Meier curves with log rank test. Multivariable survival analysis was conducted using Cox regression method, taking age, risk group, treatment, IDH1/2 mutations and IDH1 SNP105 genotype into account. RESULTS: Overall, IDH1/2 mutations were found in 41/187 (21.7%) of the AML patients. IDH1 codon 132 mutations were present in 7.9%, whereas IDH2 mutations were more frequent and mutations were identified in codon 140 and 172 in a frequency of 11.1% and 2.6%, respectively. The SNP 105C > T was present in 10.5% of the patients, similar to the normal population. A significantly reduced overall survival (OS) for patients carrying IDH2 codon 140 mutation compared with patients carrying wild-type IDH2 gene (p < 0.001) was observed in the intermediate risk patient group. Neither in the entire patient group nor subdivided in different risk groups, IDH1 mutations had any significance on OS compared to the wild-type IDH1 patients. A significant difference in OS between the heterozygous SNP variant and the homozygous wild-type was observed in the intermediate risk FLT3 negative AML patients (p = 0.004).

Once a diagnosis has been made, risk stratification and symptom assessment are vital to guide the subsequent therapy. Treatment may be required in high-risk disease, such as in cases of advanced age or prior thrombotic events. Systemic therapy is aimed at reducing the thrombotic risk and includes daily low dose aspirin and in some patients, cytoreductive therapy. Currently, the first line cytoreductive therapy includes hydroxyurea or pegylated interferon, with a phase III clinical trial underway comparing these two important agents.

In the past decade, several prognostic risk factors have been identified facilitating the classification of CLL into various risk groups. Patients with poor risk disease, such as poor cytogenetics or relapsing after purine-based analogues, had limited therapeutic options, with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-SCT) the only known therapy with curative potential. More recently, the introduction of novel agents inhibiting the B-cell receptor pathway, and the early success with chimeric antigen receptor T cells offers an effective and relatively safe option for this poor prognostic group which holds promise in the future. Alternatively, the use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens in the allo-SCT setting has led to a significant decrease in nonrelapse mortality to 16-23%, making it an attractive therapeutic option. No recent guidelines have been developed since these novel therapies became available regarding the optimal time to allo-SCT in this patient population.

We discuss overlapping and differential effects of the individual family members BCL-2, BCL-extra long (BCL-XL), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), and BCL2-like 2 (BCL-W) in the control of survival during development and pathophysiological processes such as trophic factor withdrawal, ischemic injury, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and energy stress. Finally we discuss recent evidence that several anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins influence mitochondrial bioenergetics and control neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis independent of their classical role in cell death signaling.","['Anilkumar, Ujval', 'Prehn, Jochen H M']","['Anilkumar U', 'Prehn JH']","['Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Centre for the Study of Neurological Disorders, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Centre for the Study of Neurological Disorders, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140930,Switzerland,Front Cell Neurosci,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,101477935,,,,2014/10/18 06:00,2014/10/18 06:01,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fncel.2014.00281 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Neurosci. 2014 Sep 30;8:281. doi: 10.3389/fncel.2014.00281. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'apoptosis', 'excitotoxcity', 'ischemia', 'mitochondria', 'neurodegeneration', 'neuronal development', 'neuronal injury']",,PMC4179715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, detection of mutations in tissue biopsies is particularly challenging in histiocytoses due to low tumor content and stromal contamination. We applied a droplet-digital PCR assay for quantitative detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in plasma and urine cell-free (cf) DNA and performed a prospective, blinded study in 30 patients with ECD/LCH. There was 100% concordance between tissue and urinary cfDNA genotype in treatment-naive samples. cfDNA analysis facilitated identification of previously undescribed KRAS(G12S)-mutant ECD and dynamically tracked disease burden in patients treated with a variety of therapies. These results indicate that cfDNA BRAF(V600E) mutational analysis in plasma and urine provides a convenient and reliable method of detecting mutational status and can serve as a noninvasive biomarker to monitor response to therapy in LCH and ECD. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant histiocytic disorders have remarkable responses to RAF inhibition, but mutation detection in tissue in these disorders is challenging. Here, we identify that analysis of plasma and urinary cfDNA provides a reliable method to detect the BRAF(V600E) mutation and monitor response to therapy in these disorders.","['Hyman, David M', 'Diamond, Eli L', 'Vibat, Cecile Rose T', 'Hassaine, Latifa', 'Poole, Jason C', 'Patel, Minal', 'Holley, Veronica R', 'Cabrilo, Goran', 'Lu, Timothy T', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Chung, Young Rock', 'Rampal, Raajit', 'Lacouture, Mario E', 'Rosen, Neal', 'Meric-Bernstam, Funda', 'Baselga, Jose', 'Kurzrock, Razelle', 'Erlander, Mark G', 'Janku, Filip', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Hyman DM', 'Diamond EL', 'Vibat CR', 'Hassaine L', 'Poole JC', 'Patel M', 'Holley VR', 'Cabrilo G', 'Lu TT', 'Arcila ME', 'Chung YR', 'Rampal R', 'Lacouture ME', 'Rosen N', 'Meric-Bernstam F', 'Baselga J', 'Kurzrock R', 'Erlander MG', 'Janku F', 'Abdel-Wahab O']","['Developmental Therapeutics Unit, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Trovagene, Inc., San Diego, California.', 'Trovagene, Inc., San Diego, California.', 'Trovagene, Inc., San Diego, California.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (Phase I Program), The MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (Phase I Program), The MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Trovagene, Inc., San Diego, California.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Dermatology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Program in Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (Phase I Program), The MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Developmental Therapeutics Unit, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.

Mcl-1, a major anti-apoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 family, is extensively expressed in melanoma and contributes to melanoma's well-documented chemoresistance. Here, we provide the first evidence that Mcl-1 phosphorylation at T163 by ERK1/2 and JNK is associated with the resistance of melanoma cell lines to the existing BH3 mimetics gossypol, S1 and ABT-737, and a novel anti-apoptotic mechanism of phosphorylated Mcl-1 (pMcl-1) is revealed. pMcl-1 antagonized the known BH3 mimetics by sequestering pro-apoptotic proteins that were released from Bcl-2/Mcl-1. Furthermore, an anthraquinone BH3 mimetic, compound 6, was identified to be the first small molecule to that induces endogenous apoptosis in melanoma cells by directly binding Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and pMcl-1 and disrupting the heterodimers of these proteins. Although compound 6 induced upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa, its apoptotic induction was independent of Noxa. These data reveal the promising therapeutic potential of targeting pMcl-1 to treat melanoma. Compound 6 is therefore a potent drug that targets pMcl-1 in melanoma.","['Liu, Yubo', 'Xie, Mingzhou', 'Song, Ting', 'Sheng, Hongkun', 'Yu, Xiaoyan', 'Zhang, Zhichao']","['Liu Y', 'Xie M', 'Song T', 'Sheng H', 'Yu X', 'Zhang Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141218,England,Pigment Cell Melanoma Res,Pigment cell & melanoma research,101318927,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gossypol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism']",2014/10/18 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/pcmr.12325 [doi]'],ppublish,Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2015 Mar;28(2):161-70. doi: 10.1111/pcmr.12325.

Despite the use of intensive chemotherapy, relapse remains the most common cause for therapeutic failure in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The interactions between leukemia stem cells (LSC) and marrow microenvironment appear to be critical in promoting therapeutic resistance through progressive acquisition of genetic and epigenetic changes within leukemia cells and immune evasion, resulting in leukemia cell survival. With advances in genomic-sequencing efforts, epigenetic and phenotypic characterization, personalized therapeutic strategies aimed at critical leukemia survival mechanisms may be feasible in the near future. Here, we review select novel approaches to therapy of AML such as targeting LSC, altering leukemia/marrow microenvironment interactions, inhibiting DNA repair or cell-cycle checkpoints, and augmenting immune-based antileukemia activity.","['Gojo, Ivana', 'Karp, Judith E']","['Gojo I', 'Karp JE']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland. igojo1@jhmi.edu.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20141016,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Precision Medicine', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2014/10/18 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-0900 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0900 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Dec 15;20(24):6233-41. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0900.

We examined the role for HLA-C expression levels to identify permissible HLA-C mismatches. The median fluorescence intensity, a proxy of HLA-C expression, was assigned to each HLA-C allotype in 1975 patients and their HLA-C-mismatched unrelated transplant donors. The association of outcome with the level of expression of patients' and donors' HLA-C allotypes was evaluated in multivariable models. Increasing expression level of the patient's mismatched HLA-C allotype was associated with increased risks of grades III to IV acute GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, and mortality. Increasing expression level among HLA-C mismatches with residue 116 or residue 77/80 mismatching was associated with increased nonrelapse mortality. The immunogenicity of HLA-C mismatches in unrelated donor transplantation is influenced by the expression level of the patient's mismatched HLA-C allotype.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of oral taurine supplementation on the incidence of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Forty young patients aged over 16 (range: 16-23 years) suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all receiving same chemotherapy regimen) were recruited for the study at the beginning of maintenance course of their chemotherapy. The study population was randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either taurine or placebo (2 g per day orally, divided into two doses, taken 6 h after chemotherapeutic agents) for 6 months. Life quality and adverse effects including nausea and vomiting, taste and smell alterations, and weariness were assessed using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-square test. Of 40 participants, 32 finished the study (14 female and 18 male; mean age 19.2 +/- 1.9 years). Four treatment and four placebo arm patients discontinued: one immigrated from the province, one died during the study, and six refused to continue. The results indicated that taurine-supplemented patients reported a significant (P < 0.05) improvement in chemotherapy-induced nausea and/or vomiting after taking taurine during study. Taurine significantly improved chemotherapy-induced taste and smell alterations (P < 0.05). Moreover, taurine significantly reduced weariness compared to placebo group (P < 0.05).

Human NK cells recognize HLA class I molecules through surface receptors (KIR and NKG2A) that inhibit NK cell function and kill target cells that have lost (or underexpress) HLA class I molecules as it occurs in tumors or virus-infected cells. NK cell activation is mediated by an array of activating receptors and co-receptors that recognize ligands expressed primarily on tumors or virus-infected cells. In vivo anti-tumor NK cell activity may be suppressed by tumor or tumor-associated cells. Alloreactive NK cells (i.e. those that are not inhibited by the HLA class I alleles of the patient) derived from HSC of haploidentical donors play a major role in the cure of high-risk leukemia, by killing leukemia blasts and patient's DC, thus preventing tumor relapses and graft-versus-host disease. The expression of the HLA-C2-specific activating KIR2DS1 may also contribute to NK alloreactivity in patients expressing C2 alleles. A clear correlation has been proven between the size of the alloreactive NK cell population and the clinical outcome. Recently, haplo-HSCT has been further improved with the direct infusion, together with HSC, of donor-derived, mature alloreactive NK cells and TCRgammadelta(+) T cells - both contributing to a prompt anti-leukemia effect together with an efficient defense against pathogens during the 6- to 8-week interval required for the generation of alloreactive NK cells from HSC.","['Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Montaldo, Elisa', 'Vacca, Paola', 'Del Zotto, Genny', 'Moretta, Francesca', 'Merli, Pietro', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina']","['Moretta L', 'Montaldo E', 'Vacca P', 'Del Zotto G', 'Moretta F', 'Merli P', 'Locatelli F', 'Mingari MC']","['Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Universita di Genova, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140826,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Virus Diseases/immunology']",2014/10/18 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['000365632 [pii]', '10.1159/000365632 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2014;164(4):253-64. doi: 10.1159/000365632.

It is involved in cancer progression, and has abnormal constitutive expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Posttranscriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) can affect the malignant phenotype of AML cells. In this study, we identified and characterised NRF2-regulated miRNAs in AML. An miRNA array identified miRNA expression level changes in response to NRF2 knockdown in AML cells. Further analysis of miRNAs concomitantly regulated by knockdown of the NRF2 inhibitor KEAP1 revealed the major candidate NRF2-mediated miRNAs in AML. We identified miR-125B to be upregulated and miR-29B to be downregulated by NRF2 in AML. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis identified putative NRF2 binding sites upstream of the miR-125B1 coding region and downstream of the mir-29B1 coding region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that NRF2 binds to these antioxidant response elements (AREs) located in the 5' untranslated regions of miR-125B and miR-29B. Finally, primary AML samples transfected with anti-miR-125B antagomiR or miR-29B mimic showed increased cell death responsiveness either alone or co-treated with standard AML chemotherapy. In summary, we find that NRF2 regulation of miR-125B and miR-29B acts to promote leukaemic cell survival, and their manipulation enhances AML responsiveness towards cytotoxic chemotherapeutics.","['Shah, N M', 'Zaitseva, L', 'Bowles, K M', 'MacEwan, D J', 'Rushworth, S A']","['Shah NM', 'Zaitseva L', 'Bowles KM', 'MacEwan DJ', 'Rushworth SA']","['1] Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK [2] Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK.', '1] Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK [2] Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust, Colney Lane, Norwich, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141017,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KEAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2014/10/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2014152 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2014.152 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2015 Apr;22(4):654-64. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2014.152.

Here we report that LIF is a negative regulator of p53; LIF downregulates p53 protein levels and function in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The downregulation of p53 by LIF is mediated by the activation of Stat3, which transcriptionally induces inhibitor of DNA-binding 1 (ID1). ID1 upregulates MDM2, a key negative regulator of p53, and promotes p53 protein degradation. LIF is overexpressed in a large percentage of CRCs. LIF overexpression promotes cellular resistance towards chemotherapeutic agents in cultured CRC cells and colorectal xenograft tumours in a largely p53-dependent manner. Overexpression of LIF is associated with a poor prognosis in CRC patients. Taken together, LIF is a novel negative regulator of p53, overexpression of LIF is an important mechanism for the attenuation of p53, which promotes chemoresistance in CRCs.","['Yu, Haiyang', 'Yue, Xuetian', 'Zhao, Yuhan', 'Li, Xiaoyan', 'Wu, Lihua', 'Zhang, Cen', 'Liu, Zhen', 'Lin, Kevin', 'Xu-Monette, Zijun Y', 'Young, Ken H', 'Liu, Juan', 'Shen, Zhiyuan', 'Feng, Zhaohui', 'Hu, Wenwei']","['Yu H', 'Yue X', 'Zhao Y', 'Li X', 'Wu L', 'Zhang C', 'Liu Z', 'Lin K', 'Xu-Monette ZY', 'Young KH', 'Liu J', 'Shen Z', 'Feng Z', 'Hu W']","['Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', ""1] Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA [2] Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Ji'nan 250012, China."", '1] Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA [2] First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141017,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2014/10/18 06:00,2016/02/24 06:00,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms6218 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms6218 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Oct 17;5:5218. doi: 10.1038/ncomms6218.,,,"['1 S10 RR025468-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR025468/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA160558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA156706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA143204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4203416,['NIHMS627794'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to describe all consecutive cases of PAH patients with a history of IFN exposure identified in the French reference centre for severe pulmonary hypertension between 1998 and 2012. A total of 53 patients with PAH and a history of IFN therapy were identified. 48 patients had been treated with IFNalpha for chronic hepatitis C. Most of them had portal hypertension (85%) and 56% had HIV co-infection. Five additional patients had been treated with IFNbeta for multiple sclerosis. The diagnosis of PAH was made within 3 years after IFN therapy in 66% of patients. Repeated haemodynamic assessment was available in 13 out of 16 patients exposed to IFN after the diagnosis of PAH. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance >20% was observed in 11 out of 13 cases (median 43% increase; IQR 32-67%).

However, most of these patients had other risk factors for PAH.

However, there have been few results on long-term outcomes after home care. The aims of this study were to compare general health, symptom occurrence, and self-efficacy in adult survivors who received either home care or hospital care during the early neutropenic phase after allo-HSCT and to investigate whether demographic or medical variables were associated with general health or symptom occurrence in this patient population. METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, 117 patients (hospital care: n = 78; home care: n = 39) rated their general health (SF-36), symptom occurrence (SFID-SCT, HADS), and self-efficacy (GSE) at a median of 5 (1-11) years post-HSCT. RESULTS: No differences were found regarding general health, symptom occurrence, or self-efficacy between groups. The majority of patients in both hospital care (77 %) and home care (78 %) rated their general health as ""good"" with a median of 14 (0-36) current symptoms. Symptoms of fatigue and sexual problems were among the most common. Poor general health was associated with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), low self-efficacy, and cord blood stem cells. A high symptom occurrence was associated with female gender, acute GVHD, and low self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: No long-term differences in general health and symptom occurrence were observed between home care and hospital care. Thus, home care is an alternative treatment method for patients who for various reasons prefer this treatment option. We therefore encourage other centers to offer home care to patients.","['Bergkvist, Karin', 'Winterling, Jeanette', 'Johansson, Eva', 'Johansson, Unn-Britt', 'Svahn, Britt-Marie', 'Remberger, Mats', 'Mattsson, Jonas', 'Larsen, Joacim']","['Bergkvist K', 'Winterling J', 'Johansson E', 'Johansson UB', 'Svahn BM', 'Remberger M', 'Mattsson J', 'Larsen J']","['Division of Therapeutic Immunology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, karin.bergkvist@shh.se.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141017,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology', 'Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*Home Care Services', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/18 06:00,2015/06/18 06:00,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2476-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2015 May;23(5):1273-83. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2476-9.

Therefore, the development of better and safer therapies continues to be a goal in the treatment of this disease. In the present work, we examined three different pathways that hinder cell death in the APL cell line NB4, shedding light on the mechanisms that underlie resistance to apoptosis in these cells and that might help provide them with a proliferative advantage. We found that the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 specifically induces in NB4 cells an Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response which counteracts mitochondria-dependent apoptosis induced by the lipophilic cation dequalinium. More importantly, we also demonstrated that high basal autophagy levels and the gain-of-function of mutant p53 are intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis in this cell line. According to our results, the pharmacological inhibition of autophagy and p53 mutants are useful tools to explore resistance to apoptosis in APL and other types of cancer and could be the bases of new therapeutic approaches that improve the efficiency and allow dose reduction of the current treatments.","['Ganan-Gomez, I', 'Estan-Omana, M C', 'Sancho, P', 'Aller, P', 'Boyano-Adanez, M C']","['Ganan-Gomez I', 'Estan-Omana MC', 'Sancho P', 'Aller P', 'Boyano-Adanez MC']","['Department of System Biology, Unit of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Alcala (UAH), Carretera Madrid-Barcelona Km 33.6 s/n, 28871, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141018,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'E7QC7V26B8 (Dequalinium)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Dequalinium/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leupeptins/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2014/10/18 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/10/18 06:00'],"['2013/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2237-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Mar;94(3):379-92. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2237-3.

We tested the effectiveness of PI3K/AKT/mTOR-targeting therapies and tried to identify alterations that associate with treatment sensitivity. By analyzing primary samples and cell lines, we observed a wide range of cytotoxic activity for inhibition of AKT (MK-2206), mTORC1 (rapamycin) and PI3K/mTORC1/2 (BEZ-235) with a high sensitivity of cells carrying an MLL rearrangement. In vivo PI3K/mTOR inhibition delayed tumor progression, reduced tumor load and prolonged survival in an MLL-AF9(+)/FLT3-ITD(+) xenograft mouse model. By performing targeted amplicon sequencing in 38 MLL-AF9(+) and 125 cytogenetically normal AML patient samples, we found a high additional mutation rate for genes involved in growth factor signaling in 79% of all MLL-AF9(+) samples, which could lead to a possible benefit of this cohort. PI3K/mTOR inhibition for 24 h led to the cross-activation of the ERK pathway. Further in vitro studies combining PI3K/mTOR and ERK pathway inhibition revealed highly synergistic effects in apoptosis assays. Our data implicate a possible therapeutic benefit of PI3K/mTOR inhibition in the MLL-mutated subgroup. Inhibiting rescue pathways could improve the therapeutic efficacy of PI3K-targeted therapies in AML.","['Sandhofer, N', 'Metzeler, K H', 'Rothenberg, M', 'Herold, T', 'Tiedt, S', 'Groiss, V', 'Carlet,

The effect of Gleevec on p-Crkl, caspase-3, PARP and PDCD4 protein levels, and the knockdown efficacy of PDCD4 siRNA were detected by Western blotting. The results showed that Gleevec dramatically suppressed the phosphorylation level of Crkl in a dose-dependent manner and induced significant apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of K562 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, Gleevec activated caspase-3 and its downstream substrates PARP, and the caspase pan inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (50 micromol x L(-1)) markedly reduced Gleevec-induced apoptosis from 47.97% +/- 10.56% to 31.05% +/- 9.206% (P < 0.05).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence, severity, morbidity, and risk factors of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) suppression in children with ALL, and the time course of recovery. DESIGN: Forty standard risk ALL children treated in the Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Unit, Ain-Shams University, Egypt, were classified into dexamethasone (DXM) group: 20 patients on children cancer group protocol and prednisone (PDN) group: 20 patients on modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) study group 90 protocol. Patients were followed clinically and by laboratory assessment of morning s.ACTH, basal and after low-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test of cortisol and DHEAS, at diagnosis and every 2 weeks till adrenal recovery. RESULTS: HPA recovery was earlier in PDN than DXM group (P < 0.05). In induction phases 1 and 2: 65 and 75% of PDN group recovered on week 2, while 45 and 50% of DXM group recovered in week 4. Adrenal recovery was predicted 2 weeks earlier by normalized s.DHEAS. Children below 5 years of age had earlier recovery in PDN group (P = 0.04), no age effect in DXM group. CONCLUSION: Adrenal suppression is an inevitable consequence of ALL therapy. Monitoring of cortisol levels and steroid coverage during stress is recommended, and gradual steroid tapering is suggested.","['Salem, Mona A', 'Tantawy, Azza A', 'El Sedfy, Haba H', 'El Laboudy, Mohamed A', 'Toaima, Dalia N', 'Mahmoud, Nermine H', 'Selim, Dalia M']","['Salem MA', 'Tantawy AA', 'El Sedfy HH', 'El Laboudy MA', 'Toaima DN', 'Mahmoud NH', 'Selim DM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141016,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Insufficiency', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*therapeutic use', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/pathology', 'Male', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies']",2014/10/17 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000208 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Jul;20(6):320-7. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000208.

METHODS: Haploidentical HSCT using basiliximab for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in 10 patients with leukemia was retrospectively compared to ATG for GVHD prophylaxis in 24 patients. RESULTS: All the patients achieved neutrophil engraftment. One patient in the ATG group did not achieve platelet engraftment. The incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD was 30 and 20%, respectively, in the basiliximab group and 16.7 and 4.2%, respectively, in the ATG group (P > 0.05). Extensive cGVHD developed in 40 and 22.2% of patients in the basiliximab group and ATG group, respectively (P > 0.05). Basiliximab resulted in mild infection and a low incidence (10%) of infection-related mortality; ATG resulted in relative severe infection with 29.2% infection-related mortality (P > 0.05). During the follow-up period, 20% of the basiliximab group and 22.7% of the ATG group relapsed (P > 0.05). In the basiliximab group and the ATG group, the 3-year accumulative overall survival rate was, respectively, 80 and 52.5% and the 3-year leukemia-free survival, respectively, was 60 and 49.6% (P > 0.05). DISCUSSION: The incidences of grade II-IV and grade III-IV aGVHD in the basiliximab group were similar to those in halpoidentical HSCT containing ATG. Compared to the ATG group, the basiliximab group had a lower rate of transplantation-related mortality and better long-term survival, but without statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The prophylactic regimen of basiliximab with haploidentical HSCT against GVHD seems safe and promising. More studies needed to verify this.","['Huang, Rui', 'Tu, Sanfang', 'Deng, Lan', 'Kang, Qian', 'Song, Chaoyang', 'Li, Yuhua']","['Huang R', 'Tu S', 'Deng L', 'Kang Q', 'Song C', 'Li Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141016,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9927MT646M (Basiliximab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Basiliximab', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/17 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000207 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Jul;20(6):313-9. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000207.

In particular, a wide range of both solid and liquid tumors use aerobic glycolysis to supply energy and support cell growth. This metabolic program leads to high rates of glucose consumption through glycolysis with secretion of lactate even in the presence of oxygen. Identifying the limiting events in aerobic glycolysis and the response of cancer cells to metabolic inhibition is now essential to exploit this potential metabolic dependency. Here, we examine the role of glucose uptake and the glucose transporter Glut1 in the metabolism and metabolic stress response of BCR-Abl+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (B-ALL). B-ALL cells were highly glycolytic and primary human B-ALL samples were dependent on glycolysis. We show B-ALL cells express multiple glucose transporters and conditional genetic deletion of Glut1 led to a partial loss of glucose uptake. This reduced glucose transport capacity, however, was sufficient to metabolically reprogram B-ALL cells to decrease anabolic and increase catabolic flux. Cell proliferation decreased and a limited degree of apoptosis was also observed. Importantly, Glut1-deficient B-ALL cells failed to accumulate in vivo and leukemic progression was suppressed by Glut1 deletion. Similarly, pharmacologic inhibition of aerobic glycolysis with moderate doses of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) slowed B-ALL cell proliferation, but extensive apoptosis only occurred at high doses. Nevertheless, 2-DG induced the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and sensitized B-ALL cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib in vivo. Together, these data show that despite expression of multiple glucose transporters, B-ALL cells are reliant on Glut1 to maintain aerobic glycolysis and anabolic metabolism. Further, partial inhibition of glucose metabolism is sufficient to sensitize cancer cells to specifically targeted therapies, suggesting inhibition of aerobic glycolysis as a plausible adjuvant approach for B-ALL therapies.","['Liu, T', 'Kishton, R J', 'Macintyre, A N', 'Gerriets, V A', 'Xiang, H', 'Liu, X', 'Abel, E D', 'Rizzieri, D', 'Locasale, J W', 'Rathmell, J C']","['Liu T', 'Kishton RJ', 'Macintyre AN', 'Gerriets VA', 'Xiang H', 'Liu X', 'Abel ED', 'Rizzieri D', 'Locasale JW', 'Rathmell JC']","['1] Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA [2] Department of Immunology, Duke Cancer Institute and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', '1] Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA [2] Department of Immunology, Duke Cancer Institute and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', '1] Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA [2] Department of Immunology, Duke Cancer Institute and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', '1] Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA [2] Department of Immunology, Duke Cancer Institute and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', '1] Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA [2] Department of Immunology, Duke Cancer Institute and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850, USA.', 'Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Carver College of Medicine University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Division of Cell Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850, USA.', '1] Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA [2] Department of Immunology, Duke Cancer Institute and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141016,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Aerobiosis/drug effects', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Deletion', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/*metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014431 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.431 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 16;5:e1470. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.431.,,,"['R01 CA123350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA183529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01HL087947/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA168997/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AI106835/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL087947/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31CA183529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03AI106835/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA123350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4237255,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cell Death Dis. 2014;5:e1516'],,,,

However, the major limitation in the usage of TRAIL as a chemotherapeutic agent is the development of TRAIL resistance in many cancer types including myeloid leukemia. In this study, we report for the first time that Medicarpin (Med), a naturally occurring phytoalexin sensitizes myeloid leukemia cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Combination of Med and TRAIL induced significantly higher apoptosis compared with that of the individual treatments of either agent alone through activation of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic cell death pathways characterized by the activation of caspases 8, 9, 3, and 7. Med treatment downregulated antiapoptotic proteins (Survivin, Bcl2, Bcl-xL, XIAP, and c-FLIP), upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cytochrome C, Smac/Diablo, Bid, truncated Bid (tBid), p-eIF2alpha, Bip, and CHOP (CCAAT-enhancer binding protein homologous protein)), induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest, and increased the expression of the functional TRAIL receptor DR5 through activation of the ROS-JNK-CHOP pathway. Gain and loss of function studies clearly indicated that DR5 expression was critical for Med-induced TRAIL sensitization. The Med-induced TRAIL sensitization did not involve the NFkB signaling pathway or redistribution of DR5 in lipid rafts. The concomitant treatment with Med and TRAIL showed robust apoptotic effects in primary myeloid leukemia cells but had no toxic effects in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In conclusion, our results suggest that Med sensitizes myeloid leukemia cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the upregulation of DR5 through activation of the ROS-JNK-CHOP pathway.","['Trivedi, R', 'Maurya, R', 'Mishra, D P']","['Trivedi R', 'Maurya R', 'Mishra DP']","['Cell Death Research Laboratory, Division of Endocrinology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, India.', 'Medicinal Process Chemistry Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, India.', 'Cell Death Research Laboratory, Division of Endocrinology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141016,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Pterocarpans)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '37297-20-4 (phytoalexins)', '6TX086I6IG (medicarpin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fabaceae/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pterocarpans/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014429 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.429 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 16;5:e1465. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.429.,,,,PMC4237253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of our study was to determine insulin requirements in patients with hyperglycemia on hyper-CVAD therapy using a systematic algorithm. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We did a retrospective chart review of 23 leukemia inpatients with hyperglycemia (two glucose values >250 mg/dL) on hyper-CVAD chemotherapy managed by the Endocrine Diabetes Inpatient Team algorithm. We reviewed demographic and glycemic data, insulin dosages, and use of oral hypoglycemic agents. Using our algorithm, the dose of insulin for each patient was titrated daily and with each subsequent cycle of hyper-CVAD. RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of patients had known diabetes. The median body mass index was 32.5 (range, 21.6-40.9) kg/m(2), and median age was 61 (range, 40-80) years. The overall trend in glucose values across cycles showed a statistically significant decrease with each subsequent cycle of hyper-CVAD. Hyperglycemia accounted for 81% of glucose measurements in the first cycle and 60% of glucose values in the last cycle. Patients received 1-1.3 units/kg of insulin per cycle, and insulin requirements were similar across cycles. The distribution of basal versus bolus insulin for each cycle was 63-77% prandial and 23-37% basal. Nine of the 23 patients had at least one glucose value <70 mg/dL, which accounted for 1.3% of all recorded glucose values. None of the patients had severe hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple-dose insulin therapy initiated at 1-1.2 units/kg/day, distributed as 25% basal and 75% prandial, reduced hyperglycemia in patients who were receiving high-dose dexamethasone as part of hyper-CVAD.","['Brady, Veronica', 'Thosani, Sonali', 'Zhou, Shouhou', 'Bassett, Roland', 'Busaidy, Naifa Lamki', 'Lavis, Victor']","['Brady V', 'Thosani S', 'Zhou S', 'Bassett R', 'Busaidy NL', 'Lavis V']","['1 Department of Endocrine Neoplasia & Hormonal Disorders, Division of Internal Medicine, University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141016,United States,Diabetes Technol Ther,Diabetes technology & therapeutics,100889084,"['0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Insulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'VCAD regimen']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/blood/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Insulin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Overweight/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dia.2014.0115 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetes Technol Ther. 2014 Dec;16(12):874-9. doi: 10.1089/dia.2014.0115.

EBV sBL showed significantly higher age distribution (median, 42 vs. 13 y; P<0.0001) and higher frequency of patients older than 50 years (48% vs. 16%, P<0.0001). We also revealed the difference of the involved sites. The EBV group showed significantly higher incidence of involvement of tonsil (P=0.027), adrenal gland (P=0.011), and cervical lymph node (P=0.040). In addition, the EBV group tended to have higher incidence of nodal involvement (P=0.078) and involvement of para-aorta lymph node (P=0.084) and heart (P=0.050). In contrast, the gastrointestinal tract was less frequently affected in EBV sBL (P=0.024). In addition, the less positivity for MUM1 (P=0.020) of EBV sBL was highlighted. These results indicate that biological behavior and pathogenesis of EBV sBL might be different from those of EBV sBL.

Integration of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes with microarray analysis allows additional identification of acquired uniparental disomy, a copy neutral aberration with known potential to contribute to tumor pathogenesis. However, a limitation of microarray analysis has been the inability to detect clonal heterogeneity in a sample. METHODS: This study comprised 16 samples (acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, plasma cell neoplasm) with complex cytogenetic features and evidence of clonal evolution. We used an integrated manual peak reassignment approach combining analysis of aCGH and SNP microarray data for characterization of subclonal abnormalities. We compared array findings with results obtained from conventional cytogenetic and FISH studies. RESULTS: Clonal heterogeneity was detected in 13 of 16 samples by microarray on the basis of log2 values. Use of the manual peak reassignment analysis approach improved resolution of the sample's clonal composition and genetic heterogeneity in 10 of 13 (77%) patients. Moreover, in 3 patients, clonal disease progression was revealed by array analysis that was not evident by cytogenetic or FISH studies. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic abnormalities originating from separate clonal subpopulations can be identified and further characterized by combining aCGH and SNP hybridization results from 1 integrated microarray chip by use of the manual peak reassignment technique. Its clinical utility in comparison to conventional cytogenetic or FISH studies is demonstrated.","['Hartmann, Luise', 'Stephenson, Christine F', 'Verkamp, Stephanie R', 'Johnson, Krystal R', 'Burnworth, Bettina', 'Hammock, Kelle', 'Brodersen, Lisa Eidenschink', 'de Baca, Monica E', 'Wells, Denise A', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Zehentner, Barbara K']","['Hartmann L', 'Stephenson CF', 'Verkamp SR', 'Johnson KR', 'Burnworth B', 'Hammock K', 'Brodersen LE', 'de Baca ME', 'Wells DA', 'Loken MR', 'Zehentner BK']","['HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'HematoLogics Inc., Seattle, WA. barbara@hematologics.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141015,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,,IM,"['Clonal Evolution/*genetics', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2014.227785 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2014.227785 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2014 Dec;60(12):1558-68. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2014.227785.

Although there are many reasons for this, the one commonly cited notes that the paradigms for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were merely applied to all patients with PTCL, the classic ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. Despite these challenges, progress is being made. Recently, the FDA has approved four drugs for patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL over the past 5 years, and if one counts the recent Japanese approval of the anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody for patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, five drugs have been approved worldwide. These efforts have led to the initiation of no fewer than four randomized clinical studies exploring the integration of these new agents into standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristine-prednisone)-based chemotherapy regimens for patients with newly diagnosed PTCL. In addition, a new wave of studies are exploring the merits of novel drug combinations in the disease, an effort to build on the obvious single-agent successes. What has emerged most recently is the recognition that the PTCL may be a disease-characterized by epigenetic dysregulation, which may help explain its sensitivity to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and open the door for even more creative combination approaches. Nonetheless, advances made over a relatively short period of time are changing how we now view these diseases and, hopefully, have poised us to finally improve its prognosis.

However, in primary ATL cells, although expression of the virus, including the Tax oncoprotein, appears just after an in vitro culture, integration sites of the provirus into the host genome are random, and chromosomal/genetic abnormalities are complex. ATL is thus a single disease entity that is caused by HTLV-1 and possesses diverse molecular features. The clinical features and prognosis of ATL vary, and this has led to subtypes classified into four categories: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering types, based on lactate dehydrogenase and calcium values and organ involvement. Approximately 15 to 20 million individuals are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide, 1.1 million of whom reside in Japan, and the annual incidence of ATL has been estimated to be approximately 1,000. HTLV-1 infection early in life, mainly from breast feeding, is crucial for the development of ATL. The age-specific occurrence of ATL and complex genome abnormalities that accumulate with disease progression suggest a multistep carcinogenesis model following HTLV-1 infection. Various treatment options are available for ATL and consist of watchful waiting for indolent ATL, intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for aggressive ATL, and a combination of IFNalpha and zidovudine for ATL with leukemic manifestation.

Although some retroviruses can trigger IL-1beta secretion through the DNA-sensing molecule IFI16, the effect of IL-1beta on the course of infection is unknown. To test whether IL-1beta secretion affects retroviral replication in vivo, I constructed a novel murine leukemia virus strain (FMLV-IL-1beta) that encodes the mature form of IL-1beta. This virus replicated with kinetics similar to that of wild-type virus in tissue culture but caused a dramatically more aggressive infection of both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. By 7 days postinfection (PI), mice infected with FMLV-IL-1beta exhibited splenomegaly and viral loads 300-fold higher than those in mice infected with wild-type FMLV. Furthermore, the enlarged spleens of FMLV-IL-1beta-infected mice correlated with a large expansion of Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells, as well as elevated levels of immune activation. Although FMLV-IL-1beta infection was controlled by C57BL/6 mice by 14 days p.i., FMLV-IL-1beta was able to establish a significant persistent infection and immune activation in BALB/c mice. These results demonstrate that IL-1beta secretion is a powerful positive regulator of retroviral infection and that FMLV-IL-1beta represents a new model of proinflammatory retroviral infection. IMPORTANCE: Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) is an inflammatory cytokine released in response to activation of innate pathogen-sensing pathways during microbial infection. To examine the potential impact of IL-1beta on retroviral replication in vivo, I constructed a novel mouse retrovirus strain (FMLV-IL-1beta) that encodes IL-1beta and promotes abundant IL-1beta secretion from infected cells. This virus replicates with normal kinetics in cultured cells but displays a dramatically enhanced ability to replicate in mice and caused persistent infection and immune activation in the BALB/c strain of mice. These results establish IL-1beta as a positive regulator of retroviral replication and suggest that targeting this pathway may have therapeutic benefits in infections with proinflammatory retroviruses. This virus can also be used to further study the impact of inflammatory pathways on retroviral infection.","['Browne, Edward P']",['Browne EP'],"['Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA ebrowne@mit.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141015,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology/virology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology/virology', 'Splenomegaly/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology/virology', 'Viral Load', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02314-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02314-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Jan;89(1):155-64. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02314-14.

In this study, we report somatic loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked histone H3K27me3 demethylase ubiquitously transcribed X (UTX) chromosome, in human T-ALL. Interestingly, UTX mutations were exclusively present in male T-ALL patients and allelic expression analysis revealed that UTX escapes X-inactivation in female T-ALL lymphoblasts and normal T cells. Notably, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that the H3K27me3 demethylase UTX functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor in T-ALL. Moreover, T-ALL driven by UTX inactivation exhibits collateral sensitivity to pharmacologic H3K27me3 inhibition. All together, our results show how a gender-specific and therapeutically relevant defect in balancing H3K27 methylation contributes to T-cell leukemogenesis.","['Van der Meulen, Joni', 'Sanghvi, Viraj', 'Mavrakis, Konstantinos', 'Durinck, Kaat', 'Fang, Fang', 'Matthijssens, Filip', 'Rondou, Pieter', 'Rosen, Monica', 'Pieters, Tim', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Lammens, Tim', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Menten, Bjorn', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Verhasselt, Bruno', 'Poppe, Bruce', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Wendel, Hans-Guido', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter']","['Van der Meulen J', 'Sanghvi V', 'Mavrakis K', 'Durinck K', 'Fang F', 'Matthijssens F', 'Rondou P', 'Rosen M', 'Pieters T', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Delabesse E', 'Lammens T', 'De Moerloose B', 'Menten B', 'Van Roy N', 'Verhasselt B', 'Poppe B', 'Benoit Y', 'Taghon T', 'Melnick AM', 'Speleman F', 'Wendel HG', 'Van Vlierberghe P']","['Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Department for Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Centre for Human Genetics, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium;', 'INSERM U563, Toulouse, France;', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium; and.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium; and.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium; and.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141015,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Utx protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Demethylases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sex Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39523-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-577270 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 1;125(1):13-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-577270.

METHODS: Specimens from 20 patients evaluated on a service basis by tissue-based immunofluorescence yielded a synaptic immunostaining pattern consistent with DPPX-IgG (serum, 20; CSF, all 7 available). Transfected HEK293 cell-based assay confirmed DPPX specificity in all specimens. Sixty-nine patients with stiff-person syndrome and related disorders were also evaluated by DPPX-IgG cell-based assay. RESULTS: Of 20 seropositive patients, 12 were men; median symptom onset age was 53 years (range, 13-75). Symptom onset was insidious in 15 and subacute in 5. Twelve patients reported prodromal weight loss. Neurologic disorders were multifocal. All had one or more brain or brainstem manifestations: amnesia (16), delirium (8), psychosis (4), depression (4), seizures (2), and brainstem disorders (15; eye movement disturbances [8], ataxia [7], dysphagia [6], dysarthria [4], respiratory failure [3]). Nine patients reported sleep disturbance. Manifestations of central hyperexcitability included myoclonus (8), exaggerated startle (6), diffuse rigidity (6), and hyperreflexia (6). Dysautonomia involved the gastrointestinal tract (9; diarrhea [6], gastroparesis, and constipation [3]), bladder (7), cardiac conduction system (3), and thermoregulation (1). Two patients had B-cell neoplasms: gastrointestinal lymphoma (1), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1). Substantial neurologic improvements followed immunotherapy in 7 of 11 patients with available treatment data. DPPX-IgG was not detected in any of the stiff-person syndrome patients. CONCLUSIONS: DPPX-IgG is a biomarker for an immunotherapy-responsive multifocal neurologic disorder of the central and autonomic nervous systems.","['Tobin, William Oliver', 'Lennon, Vanda A', 'Komorowski, Lars', 'Probst, Christian', 'Clardy, Stacey Lynn', 'Aksamit, Allen J', 'Appendino, Juan Pablo', 'Lucchinetti, Claudia F', 'Matsumoto, Joseph Y', 'Pittock, Sean J', 'Sandroni, Paola', 'Tippmann-Peikert, Maja', 'Wirrell, Elaine C', 'McKeon, Andrew']","['Tobin WO', 'Lennon VA', 'Komorowski L', 'Probst C', 'Clardy SL', 'Aksamit AJ', 'Appendino JP', 'Lucchinetti CF', 'Matsumoto JY', 'Pittock SJ', 'Sandroni P', 'Tippmann-Peikert M', 'Wirrell EC', 'McKeon A']","['From the Departments of Neurology (W.O.T., V.A.L., S.L.C., A.J.A., C.F.L., J.Y.M., S.J.P., P.S., M.T.-P., E.C.W., A.M.), Laboratory Medicine and Pathology (V.A.L., S.J.P., A.M.), Immunology (V.A.L.), and Pediatrics (E.C.W.), College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;

Although the chronic type is regarded as indolent ATL, about half of the cases progress to acute-type ATL. The molecular pathogenesis of acute transformation in chronic-type ATL is only partially understood. In an effort to determine the molecular pathogeneses of ATL, and especially the molecular mechanism of acute transformation, oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization and comprehensive gene expression profiling were applied to 27 and 35 cases of chronic and acute type ATL, respectively. The genomic profile of the chronic type was nearly identical to that of acute-type ATL, although more genomic alterations characteristic of acute-type ATL were observed. Among the genomic alterations frequently observed in acute-type ATL, the loss of CDKN2A, which is involved in cell-cycle deregulation, was especially characteristic of acute-type ATL compared with chronic-type ATL. Furthermore, we found that genomic alteration of CD58, which is implicated in escape from the immunosurveillance mechanism, is more frequently observed in acute-type ATL than in the chronic-type. Interestingly, the chronic-type cases with cell-cycle deregulation and disruption of immunosurveillance mechanism were associated with earlier progression to acute-type ATL. These findings suggested that cell-cycle deregulation and the immune escape mechanism play important roles in acute transformation of the chronic type and indicated that these alterations are good predictive markers for chronic-type ATL.","['Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Taira, Naoya', 'Uike, Naokuni', 'Umino, Akira', 'Arita, Kotaro', 'Suguro, Miyuki', 'Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Kinoshita, Tomohiro', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Seto, Masao']","['Yoshida N', 'Karube K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Taira N', 'Uike N', 'Umino A', 'Arita K', 'Suguro M', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Kinoshita T', 'Ohshima K', 'Seto M']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.

To investigate this process in erythro-megakaryopoiesis, we correlated the genome-wide chromatin occupancy signatures of four master hematopoietic transcription factors (GATA1, GATA2, TAL1, and FLI1) and three diagnostic histone modification marks with the gene expression changes that occur during development of primary cultured megakaryocytes (MEG) and primary erythroblasts (ERY) from murine fetal liver hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We identified a robust, genome-wide mechanism of MEG-specific lineage priming by a previously described stem/progenitor cell-expressed transcription factor heptad (GATA2, LYL1, TAL1, FLI1, ERG, RUNX1, LMO2) binding to MEG-associated cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in multipotential progenitors. This is followed by genome-wide GATA factor switching that mediates further induction of MEG-specific genes following lineage commitment. Interaction between GATA and ETS factors appears to be a key determinant of these processes. In contrast, ERY-specific lineage priming is biased toward GATA2-independent mechanisms. In addition to its role in MEG lineage priming, GATA2 plays an extensive role in late megakaryopoiesis as a transcriptional repressor at loci defined by a specific DNA signature. Our findings reveal important new insights into how ERY and MEG lineages arise from a common bipotential progenitor via overlapping and divergent functions of shared hematopoietic transcription factors.","['Pimkin, Maxim', 'Kossenkov, Andrew V', 'Mishra, Tejaswini', 'Morrissey, Christapher S', 'Wu, Weisheng', 'Keller, Cheryl A', 'Blobel, Gerd A', 'Lee, Dongwon', 'Beer, Michael A', 'Hardison, Ross C', 'Weiss, Mitchell J']","['Pimkin M', 'Kossenkov AV', 'Mishra T', 'Morrissey CS', 'Wu W', 'Keller CA', 'Blobel GA', 'Lee D', 'Beer MA', 'Hardison RC', 'Weiss MJ']","[""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; Pediatric Residency Program, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15224, USA;"", 'Center for Systems and Computational Biology, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia 19019, Pennsylvania, USA;', 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', ""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;"", 'McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.', 'McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.', 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', ""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; weissmi@email.chop.edu rch8@psu.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141015,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.164178.113 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.164178.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2014 Dec;24(12):1932-44. doi: 10.1101/gr.164178.113.

We combined ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data in six mouse cell types representing a progression from multilineage precursors to differentiated erythroblasts and megakaryocytes. We found that sites of occupancy shift dramatically during commitment to the erythroid lineage, vary further during terminal maturation, and are strongly associated with changes in gene expression. In multilineage progenitors, the likely target genes are enriched for hematopoietic growth and functions associated with the mature cells of specific daughter lineages (such as megakaryocytes). In contrast, target genes in erythroblasts are specifically enriched for red cell functions. Furthermore, shifts in TAL1 occupancy during erythroid differentiation are associated with gene repression (dissociation) and induction (co-occupancy with GATA1). Based on both enrichment for transcription factor binding site motifs and co-occupancy determined by ChIP-seq, recruitment by GATA transcription factors appears to be a stronger determinant of TAL1 binding to chromatin than the canonical E-box binding site motif. Studies of additional proteins lead to the model that TAL1 regulates expression after being directed to a distinct subset of genomic binding sites in each cell type via its association with different complexes containing master regulators such as GATA2, ERG, and RUNX1 in multilineage cells and the lineage-specific master regulator GATA1 in erythroblasts.","['Wu, Weisheng', 'Morrissey, Christapher S', 'Keller, Cheryl A', 'Mishra, Tejaswini', 'Pimkin, Maxim', 'Blobel, Gerd A', 'Weiss, Mitchell J', 'Hardison, Ross C']","['Wu W', 'Morrissey CS', 'Keller CA', 'Mishra T', 'Pimkin M', 'Blobel GA', 'Weiss MJ', 'Hardison RC']","['Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;', ""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;"", ""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", ""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", 'Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141015,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (GATA Transcription Factors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'GATA Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Hematopoiesis', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Position-Specific Scoring Matrices', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcriptome']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.164830.113 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.164830.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2014 Dec;24(12):1945-62. doi: 10.1101/gr.164830.113.

PMT has recently been accepted by the World Health Organization as a formal tumour entity. The genetic basis and oncogenic pathways underlying its tumourigenesis remain obscure. In this study, we identified a novel FN1-FGFR1 fusion gene in three out of four PMTs by next-generation RNA sequencing. The fusion transcripts and proteins were subsequently confirmed with RT-PCR and western blotting. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed six cases with FN1-FGFR1 fusion out of an additional 11 PMTs. Overall, nine out of 15 PMTs (60%) harboured this fusion. The FN1 gene possibly provides its constitutively active promoter and the encoded protein's oligomerization domains to overexpress and facilitate the activation of the FGFR1 kinase domain. Interestingly, unlike the prototypical leukaemia-inducing FGFR1 fusion genes, which are ligand-independent, the FN1-FGFR1 chimeric protein was predicted to preserve its ligand-binding domains, suggesting an advantage of the presence of its ligands (such as FGF23 secreted at high levels by the tumour) in the activation of the chimeric receptor tyrosine kinase, thus effecting an autocrine or a paracrine mechanism of tumourigenesis.","['Lee, Jen-Chieh', 'Jeng, Yung-Ming', 'Su, Sheng-Yao', 'Wu, Chen-Tu', 'Tsai, Keh-Sung', 'Lee, Cheng-Han', 'Lin, Chung-Yen', 'Carter, Jodi M', 'Huang, Jenq-Wen', 'Chen, Shu-Hwa', 'Shih, Shyang-Rong', 'Marino-Enriquez, Adrian', 'Chen, Chih-Chi', 'Folpe, Andrew L', 'Chang, Yih-Leong', 'Liang, Cher-Wei']","['Lee JC', 'Jeng YM', 'Su SY', 'Wu CT', 'Tsai KS', 'Lee CH', 'Lin CY', 'Carter JM', 'Huang JW', 'Chen SH', 'Shih SR', 'Marino-Enriquez A', 'Chen CC', 'Folpe AL', 'Chang YL', 'Liang CW']","['Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150107,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FGF23 protein, human)', '0 (FN1 protein, human)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '7Q7P4S7RRE (Fibroblast Growth Factor-23)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor-23', 'Fibronectins/analysis/*genetics', '*Gene Fusion', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Hypophosphatemia, Familial/*etiology', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Connective Tissue/chemistry/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/analysis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.4465 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2015 Mar;235(4):539-45. doi: 10.1002/path.4465.

However, the mechanisms of action and the effects of obovatol against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unclear and require further investigation. Therefore, this study was conducted using a human AML cell line (MM6). Obovatol increased pro-apoptotic (Bax) and decreased anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) protein expression, resulting in caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation measured by caspase-Glo 3/7 assay. Furthermore, obovatol activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway [c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38] and inhibited the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway analyzed by western blot analysis. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that obovatol inhibits cell proliferation in AML and induces apoptosis through the activation of the MAPK pathway in addition to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition, obovatol suppressed the expression of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) target genes by inhibiting the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Therefore, these results suggest that obovatol may have potential for use in the treatment of leukemia.","['Kim, Hyeng-Soo', 'Lim, Ga Young', 'Hwang, Junmo', 'Ryoo, Zae Young', 'Huh, Tae-Lin', 'Lee, Sanggyu']","['Kim HS', 'Lim GY', 'Hwang J', 'Ryoo ZY', 'Huh TL', 'Lee S']","['School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141002,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Phenyl Ethers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '83864-78-2 (obovatol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Magnolia/chemistry', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phenyl Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2014.1957 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2014 Dec;34(6):1675-80. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2014.1957.

Now, one major focus is to further explore its potential therapeutic use. From the mechanism, it becomes clear that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play a pivotal role in triggering RNAi. This chapter describes the in vivo application of targeted non-virally delivered synthetic bcr-abl siRNA in a female patient with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant to imatinib (Y253F mutation) and chemotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A remarkable inhibition of the overexpressed bcr-abl oncogene resulting in increased apoptosis of CML cells was found. In vivo siRNA application was well tolerated without any clinically adverse events. The current findings imply that the clinical application of synthetic siRNA is feasible and safe and has real potential for genetic-based therapies using synthetic non-viral carriers.","['Koldehoff, Michael']",['Koldehoff M'],"['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstr. 55, 45122, Essen, Germany, michael.koldehoff@uk-essen.de.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'MR86K0XRQP (1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonium)propane)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/chemistry/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/chemistry/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-1538-5_17 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2015;1218:277-92. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-1538-5_17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic rats treated with this new vaccine had less leukemic cell mass in their bone marrows and less extramedullar dissemination of the leukemic disease examined postmortem compared with rats given the control vaccine.

At the same time, structural similarities in both enzymes that originate HIV PR inhibitors can also be an HTLV-1 PR inhibitor. But the expectations failed because of rejection of HIV PR inhibitors from the HTLV-1 PR binding pocket. In this present study, the reason for the HIV PR inhibitor rejection from the HTLV-1 binding site was identified through sequence analysis and molecular dynamics simulation method. Functional analysis of M37A mutation in HTLV PR clearly shows that the MET37 specificity and screening of potential inhibitors targeting MET37 is performed by using approved 90% similar HIV PR inhibitor compounds.

APL cells are unable to differentiate into mature granulocytes since PML-RARalpha functions as a strong transcriptional repressor for a gene involved in granulocyte differentiation. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the first agent that has been developed to target specific disease-causing molecules, i.e., ATRA suppresses abnormal functions of oncogenic proteins. Moreover, ATRA facilitates the differentiation of APL cells toward mature granulocytes by changing epigenetic modifiers from corepressor complexes to co-activator complexes on target genes after binding to the ligand-binding domain at the RARalpha moiety of the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein. On the other hand, arsenic trioxide (ATO), another promising agent used to treat APL, directly binds to the PML moiety of the PML-RARalpha protein, causing oxidation and multimerization. ATO enhances the conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifiers to PML-RARalpha, followed by ubiquitination and degradation, relieving the genes associated with granulocytic differentiation from suppressive restraint by the oncoprotein. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that combination therapy with both ATRA and ATO is useful to achieve remission.","['Nitto, Takeaki', 'Sawaki, Kohei']","['Nitto T', 'Sawaki K']","['Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy, Yokohama College of Pharmacy, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141015,Japan,J Pharmacol Sci,Journal of pharmacological sciences,101167001,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jphs/14R15CP [pii]', '10.1254/jphs.14r15cp [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Sci. 2014;126(3):179-85. doi: 10.1254/jphs.14r15cp.

Approximately, one-third of all inherited disorders and some forms of cancer are caused by nonsense or frame shift mutations that introduce PTCs, and NMD can modulate the clinical phenotype of these diseases. 5-azacytidine is an analogue of the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine, which is approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloid leukemia. Here, we reveal that 5-azacytidine inhibits NMD in a dose-dependent fashion specifically upregulating the expression of both PTC-containing mutant and cellular NMD targets. Moreover, this activity of 5-azacytidine depends on the induction of MYC expression, thus providing a link between the effect of this drug and one of the key cellular pathways that are known to affect NMD activity. Furthermore, the effective concentration of 5-azacytidine in cells corresponds to drug levels used in patients, qualifying 5-azacytidine as a candidate drug that could potentially be repurposed for the treatment of Mendelian and acquired genetic diseases that are caused by PTC mutations.","['Bhuvanagiri, Madhuri', 'Lewis, Joe', 'Putzker, Kerstin', 'Becker, Jonas P', 'Leicht, Stefan', 'Krijgsveld, Jeroen', 'Batra, Richa', 'Turnwald, Brad', 'Jovanovic, Bogdan', 'Hauer, Christian', 'Sieber, Jana', 'Hentze, Matthias W', 'Kulozik, Andreas E']","['Bhuvanagiri M', 'Lewis J', 'Putzker K', 'Becker JP', 'Leicht S', 'Krijgsveld J', 'Batra R', 'Turnwald B', 'Jovanovic B', 'Hauer C', 'Sieber J', 'Hentze MW', 'Kulozik AE']","['Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre for Molecular Biology of the University of HeidelbergUniversity of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany hentze@embl.de andreas.kulozik@med.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany hentze@embl.de andreas.kulozik@med.uni-heidelberg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,EMBO Mol Med,EMBO molecular medicine,101487380,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['emmm.201404461 [pii]', '10.15252/emmm.201404461 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Mol Med. 2014 Dec;6(12):1593-609. doi: 10.15252/emmm.201404461.,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'MYC', 'nonsense-mediated decay', 'premature termination codons']",,PMC4287977,,,['EMBO Mol Med. 2014 Dec;6(12):1518-20.

Accumulating evidence suggests many survivors have long-term medical and supportive care needs, and that these needs vary by survivors' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. To illustrate how cancer registry data may be useful in survivorship care service planning, we generated population-based estimates of cancer prevalence in Ireland and described socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the survivor population. METHODS: Details of people diagnosed with invasive cancer (ICD10 C00-C96) during 1994-2011, and who were still alive on 31/12/2011, were abstracted from the National Cancer Registry, and tabulated by cancer site, sex, current age, marital status, initial treatment, and time since diagnosis. Associations were investigated using chi-square tests. RESULTS: After excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, 17-year cancer prevalence in Ireland was 112,610 (females: 58,054 (52%) males: 54,556 (48%)). The four most prevalent cancers among females were breast (26,066), colorectum (6,598), melanoma (4,593) and uterus (3,505) and among males were prostate (23,966), colorectum (8,207), lymphoma (3,236) and melanoma (2,774). At the end of 2011, 39% of female survivors were aged <60 and 35% were >/=70 compared to 25% and 46% of males (p < 0.001). More than half of survivors of bladder, colorectal and prostate cancer were >/=70. Cancers with the highest percentages of younger (<40) survivors were: testis (50%); leukaemia (females: 28%; males: 22%); cervix (20%); and lymphoma (females: 19%; males: 20%). Fewer female (57%) than male (64%) survivors were married but the percentage single was similar (17-18%). More female (25%) than male survivors (18%; p < 0.001) were >/=10 years from diagnosis. Overall, 69% of survivors had undergone cancer-directed surgery, and 39%, 32% and 18% had received radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, respectively. These frequencies were higher among females than males (surgery: 82%, 54%; radiotherapy: 42%, 35%; chemotherapy: 40%, 22%; hormone therapy: 23%, 13%). CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal the socio-demographic and clinical heterogeneity of the survivor population, and highlight groups which may have specific medical and supportive care needs. These types of population-based estimates may help decision-makers, planners and service providers to develop follow-up and after-care services to effectively meet survivors' needs.","['Sharp, Linda', 'Deady, Sandra', 'Gallagher, Pamela', 'Molcho, Michal', 'Pearce, Alison', 'Alforque Thomas, Audrey', 'Timmons, Aileen', 'Comber, Harry']","['Sharp L', 'Deady S', 'Gallagher P', 'Molcho M', 'Pearce A', 'Alforque Thomas A', 'Timmons A', 'Comber H']","['National Cancer Registry, Building 6800, Cork Airport Business Park, Kinsale Road, Cork, Ireland. linda.sharp@ncri.ie.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141015,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Aftercare', 'Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ireland/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', '*Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-767 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-767 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Oct 15;14:767. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-767.,,,,PMC4216835,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to define feasibility, toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, response rate, and biological correlates of response in children and young adults with refractory B-cell malignancies treated with CD19-CAR T cells. METHODS: This phase 1, dose-escalation trial consecutively enrolled children and young adults (aged 1-30 years) with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Autologous T cells were engineered via an 11-day manufacturing process to express a CD19-CAR incorporating an anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment plus TCR zeta and CD28 signalling domains. All patients received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide before a single infusion of CD19-CAR T cells. Using a standard 3 + 3 design to establish the maximum tolerated dose, patients received either 1 x 10(6) CAR-transduced T cells per kg (dose 1), 3 x 10(6) CAR-transduced T cells per kg (dose 2), or the entire CAR T-cell product if sufficient numbers of cells to meet the assigned dose were not generated. After the dose-escalation phase, an expansion cohort was treated at the maximum tolerated dose. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01593696. FINDINGS: Between July 2, 2012, and June 20, 2014, 21 patients (including eight who had previously undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) were enrolled and infused with CD19-CAR T cells. 19 received the prescribed dose of CD19-CAR T cells, whereas the assigned dose concentration could not be generated for two patients (90% feasible). All patients enrolled were assessed for response. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as 1 x 10(6) CD19-CAR T cells per kg. All toxicities were fully reversible, with the most severe being grade 4 cytokine release syndrome that occurred in three (14%) of 21 patients (95% CI 3.0-36.3). The most common non-haematological grade 3 adverse events were fever (nine [43%] of 21 patients), hypokalaemia (nine [43%] of 21 patients), fever and neutropenia (eight [38%] of 21 patients), and cytokine release syndrome (three [14%) of 21 patients). INTERPRETATION: CD19-CAR T cell therapy is feasible, safe, and mediates potent anti-leukaemic activity in children and young adults with chemotherapy-resistant B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. All toxicities were reversible and prolonged B-cell aplasia did not occur.

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are characteristic of AML. Zinc finger protein 382 (ZNF382) has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene possibly regulated by promoter hypermethylation in various types of human cancer. However, ZNF382 expression and methylation status in pediatric AML is unknown. In the present study, ZNF382 transcription levels were evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Methylation status was investigated by methylation-specific (MSP) PCR and bisulfate genomic sequencing (BGS). The prognostic significance of ZNF382 expression and promoter methylation was assessed in 105 cases of pediatric AML. The array data suggested that the ZNF382 promoter was hypermethylated in the AML cases examined. MSP PCR and BGS analysis revealed that ZNF382 was hypermethylated in leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) upregulated ZNF382 expression in the selected leukemia cell lines. The aberrant methylation of ZNF382 was observed in 10% (2/20) of the control samples compared with 26.7% (28/105) of the AML samples. ZNF382 expression was significantly decreased in the 105 AML patients compared with the controls. Patients with ZNF382 methylation showed lower ZNF382 transcript levels compared with patients exhibiting no methylation. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics or cytogenetic analysis between the patients with or without ZNF382 methylation. ZNF382 methylation correlated with minimal residual disease (MRD). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed similar survival times in the samples with ZNF382 methylation, and multivariate analysis revealed that ZNF382 methylation was not an independent prognostic factor in pediatric AML. The epigenetic inactivation of ZNF382 by promoter hypermethylation can be observed in AML cell lines and pediatric AML samples. Therefore, our study suggests that ZNF382 may be considered a putative tumor suppressor gene in pediatric AML. However, further studies focusing on the mechanisms responsible for ZNF382 downregulation in pediatric leukemia are required.","['Tao, Yan-Fang', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Lu, Jun', 'Cao, Lan', 'Zhao, Wen-Li', 'Xiao, Pei-Fang', 'Xu, Li-Xiao', 'Li, Zhi-Heng', 'Wang, Na-Na', 'Du, Xiao-Juan', 'Sun, Li-Chao', 'Zhao, He', 'Fang, Fang', 'Su, Guang-Hao', 'Li, Yan-Hong', 'Li, Yi-Ping', 'Xu, Yun-Yun', 'Ni, Jian', 'Wang, Jian', 'Feng, Xing', 'Pan, Jian']","['Tao YF', 'Hu SY', 'Lu J', 'Cao L', 'Zhao WL', 'Xiao PF', 'Xu LX', 'Li ZH', 'Wang NN', 'Du XJ', 'Sun LC', 'Zhao H', 'Fang F', 'Su GH', 'Li YH', 'Li YP', 'Xu YY', 'Ni J', 'Wang J', 'Feng X', 'Pan J']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, P.R.

Among its possible presentations, leptomeningeal involvement of MM, also termed central nervous system myelomatosis (CNS-MM) is rare and is characterized by the presence of neoplastic plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). So far, 187 cases of CNS-MM have been reported : the great majority of them were diagnosed by cytological assays and flow cytometry was used in only eight cases. We describe a case of CNS-MM in a 62-year-old woman, previously treated with chemotherapy (VTD) and autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for stage IIIB IgG-lambda MM. After achieving a very good partial response, the patient showed progression of disease, with an extramedullary localization. During administration of second-line therapy, the patient showed severe neurological symptoms. MRI resulted negative. Diagnosis of CNS-MM was made by multiparameter flow cytometry, which showed the presence of CD56(+) plasma cells in a CSF sample, in the absence of plasma cell leukemia. In this paper we also present a review of the eight previous cases of CNS-MM diagnosed by flow cytometry. We found that the application of flow cytometry in cases of MM with neurological symptoms allows a rapid diagnosis of CNS-MM and provides useful information about plasma cell phenotype (including CD56 expression). Some cases of CNS-MM are characterized by normal MRI. In addition, some evidences deriving from the review of literature suggest that CSF monitoring by flow cytometry in such cases might be used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.","['Marini, Alessandra', 'Carulli, Giovanni', 'Lari, Tiziana', 'Buda, Gabriele', 'Lambelet, Paola', 'Ciancia, Eugenio M', 'Benedetti, Edoardo', 'Caracciolo, Francesco', 'Ferreri, Maria Immacolata', 'Pesaresi, Ilaria', 'Rousseau, Martina', 'Ottaviano, Virginia', 'Azzara, Antonio', 'Petrini, Mario']","['Marini A', 'Carulli G', 'Lari T', 'Buda G', 'Lambelet P', 'Ciancia EM', 'Benedetti E', 'Caracciolo F', 'Ferreri MI', 'Pesaresi I', 'Rousseau M', 'Ottaviano V', 'Azzara A', 'Petrini M']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pathology, Versilia Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,,IM,"['Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*secondary', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism/pathology']",2014/10/17 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jslrt/54.129 [pii]', '10.3960/jslrt.54.129 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2014;54(2):129-36. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.54.129.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential target genes regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs were also predicted and analyzed. Results demonstrated that 182 miRNAs and 166 miRNAs were differentially expressed in Nalm-6-MVs and Jurkat-MVs, respectively. Many oncogenes, tumor suppressors and signal pathway genes were targeted by these aberrantly expressed miRNAs, which might contribute to the development of B-ALL or T-ALL.

The fundamental decision in AML then becomes whether to recommend standard or investigational treatment. This decision must rest on the likely outcome of standard treatment. Hence we review factors that predict treatment related mortality and resistance to therapy, the latter the principal cause of failure even in patients aged 70 or above. We emphasize the limitations of prediction of resistance based only on pre-treatment factors and stress the need to incorporate post-treatment factors, for example indicators of minimal residual disease. We review various newer therapeutic options and considerations that underlie the decision to recommend allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.","['Estey, Elihu H']",['Estey EH'],"['Division of Hematology, University of Washington and Member, Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Allografts', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Patient Selection', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Therapies, Investigational', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/10/17 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/10/17 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23834 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Nov;89(11):1063-81. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23834.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Belgium, the azacitidine reimbursement process can take several months, and is often delayed at submission for medical assessment by the Belgian National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance of incomplete patient dossiers, due to disease complexity and classification, and administrative burden. We describe the Vidaza Access Program and its application to an initial 175 patients. Individual medical dossiers were reviewed for completeness to facilitate patient access to treatment in Belgium. METHODS: A standardized anonymized patient information form is completed by the physician and sent for review to the Belgian Celgene Medical Department. The form is reviewed within three working days and, for complete dossiers, Celgene grants a financial guarantee for treatment with azacitidine. The patient can then be treated without the hospital being subjected to financial risk. RESULTS: Between January 2013 and June 2014, 63 physicians (53 Belgian hospitals) recruited 175 patients. In total, 163 patient dossiers were approved by Celgene (120 MDS, 36 AML, and 7 CMML), of which 104 dossiers were also approved by the review committee and 49 have been waiting for a final decision for a median of 6 months; no information is currently available for the remaining 10. No dossiers approved by Celgene have been rejected by the review committee. CONCLUSIONS: The Celgene Vidaza Access Program offers support to healthcare professionals in the appropriate use of azacitidine. By facilitating the assessment of patient dossiers and providing a financial guarantee for prescribers and hospitals, treatment can be initiated more rapidly and patients may better benefit from azacitidine treatment.","['Meers, S', 'Selleslag, D', 'Potier, H', 'Glasmacher, A', 'Mineur, P', 'Voelter, V']","['Meers S', 'Selleslag D', 'Potier H', 'Glasmacher A', 'Mineur P', 'Voelter V']","['AZ Klina , Brasschaat , Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141017,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Belgium', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Reimbursement Mechanisms/organization & administration']",2014/10/16 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2014.972499 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2015 Jan;31(1):35-42. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.972499.

Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells targeting CD19 may overcome many limitations of conventional therapies and induce remission in patients with refractory disease. METHODS: We infused autologous T cells transduced with a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CTL019) lentiviral vector in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL at doses of 0.76x10(6) to 20.6x10(6) CTL019 cells per kilogram of body weight. Patients were monitored for a response, toxic effects, and the expansion and persistence of circulating CTL019 T cells. RESULTS: A total of 30 children and adults received CTL019. Complete remission was achieved in 27 patients (90%), including 2 patients with blinatumomab-refractory disease and 15 who had undergone stem-cell transplantation. CTL019 cells proliferated in vivo and were detectable in the blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid of patients who had a response. Sustained remission was achieved with a 6-month event-free survival rate of 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51 to 88) and an overall survival rate of 78% (95% CI, 65 to 95). At 6 months, the probability that a patient would have persistence of CTL019 was 68% (95% CI, 50 to 92) and the probability that a patient would have relapse-free B-cell aplasia was 73% (95% CI, 57 to 94). All the patients had the cytokine-release syndrome. Severe cytokine-release syndrome, which developed in 27% of the patients, was associated with a higher disease burden before infusion and was effectively treated with the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell therapy against CD19 was effective in treating relapsed and refractory ALL. CTL019 was associated with a high remission rate, even among patients for whom stem-cell transplantation had failed, and durable remissions up to 24 months were observed.

Possible reasons for this different pattern of results include an increased incidence of unfavorable and a decreased incidence of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities in AYAs compared with children. Furthermore, in AYAs less intensive treatments (especially lower cumulative doses of drugs such as asparaginase, corticosteroids and methotrexate) and longer gaps between courses of chemotherapy are planned compared to those in children. However, although favorable results obtained in AYAs receiving pediatric protocols have been consistently reported in several international collaborative trials, physicians must also be aware of the specific toxicity pattern associated with increased success in AYAs, since an excess of toxicity may compromise overall treatment schedule intensity.

Current chemotherapy regimens result in complete remission in many cases; however, there exists no standard efficacious therapy for refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The hypomethylating agent, azacitidine, is effective in a limited number of such cases. We present a 57-year-old Filipino male with acute myeloid leukemia who was refractory to two induction chemotherapy regimens; however, he achieved complete remission after palliative therapy with azacitidine. We report this case to demonstrate the efficacy of azacitidine in refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Although the effectiveness of azacitidine in improving overall survival has been shown, this case demonstrates the effect on remission induction in high risk AML. Further studies are needed to delineate subsets of acute myeloid leukemia in which azacitidine will serve as effective therapy and to identify other targeted agents that may potentiate its effects.","['Powers, Harry Ross', 'Bachar, Moshe', 'Savage, Natasha', 'Toscano, Michael', 'Dainer, Paul M']","['Powers HR', 'Bachar M', 'Savage N', 'Toscano M', 'Dainer PM']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Regents University , Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Regents University , Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Regents University , Augusta, GA, USA ; Charlie Norwood Veteran Affairs Medical Center , Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Regents University , Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Charlie Norwood Veteran Affairs Medical Center , Augusta, GA, USA ; Section of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Regents University , Augusta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20140930,Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,,2014/10/16 06:00,2014/10/16 06:01,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/hr.2014.5516 [doi]'],epublish,Hematol Rep. 2014 Sep 30;6(3):5516. doi: 10.4081/hr.2014.5516. eCollection 2014 Aug 26.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloblastic/monocytic/refractory', 'azacitidine', 'leukemia', 'salvage chemotherapy']",,PMC4194383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to identify serum candidate peptides for monitoring MRD in adult ALL. RESULTS: A total of 33 peptides in the molecular weight range of 1000-10000 Da were detected using ClinProt system and statistically different between adult patients with ALL and healthy controls. Quick classifier (QC) algorithm was used to obtain a diagnostic model consisting of five peptides that could discriminate patients with ALL from controls with a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (96.67%). The peptides in the QC model were identified as fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), isoform 1 of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor, platelet factor 4 (PF4) by high pressure/performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Relative intensities of the five peptides were compared among ALL different groups for the potential importance of MRD evaluation in ALL. The peptides with increased relative intensities in newly diagnosed (ND) ALL patients were found to be decreased in their relative intensities after complete remission (CR) of adult ALL. When ALL patients were refractory & relapsed (RR), relative intensities of the peptides were elevated again. Peptides with decreased relative intensities in ND and RR ALL patients were found to be increased in their relative intensities when ALL patients achieved CR. The findings were validated by ELISA and western blot. Further linear regression analyses were performed to eliminate the influence of platelet and white blood cell counts on serum protein contents and indicated that there were no correlations between the contents of all four proteins (PF4, connective tissue active peptide III, FGA and GSTP1) and white blood cell or platelet counts in ALL different groups and healthy control. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate the five peptides, FGA, isoform 1 of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor, GSTP1, PF4 and connective tissue active peptide III would be potential biomarkers for forecasting relapse, monitoring MRD and evaluating therapeutic response in adult ALL.","['Bai, Ju', 'He, Aili', 'Huang, Chen', 'Yang, Juan', 'Zhang, Wanggang', 'Wang, Jianli', 'Yang, Yun', 'Zhang, Pengyu', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Bai J', 'He A', 'Huang C', 'Yang J', 'Zhang W', 'Wang J', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang P', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou F']","[""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province China."", ""Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Medical school of Xi'an Jiaotong University/Key Laboratory of Environment and Disease-Related Gene, Ministry of Education, Xi'an, 710061 Shaanxi China."", ""Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Medical school of Xi'an Jiaotong University/Key Laboratory of Environment and Disease-Related Gene, Ministry of Education, Xi'an, 710061 Shaanxi China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140916,England,Proteome Sci,Proteome science,101170539,,,,2014/10/16 06:00,2014/10/16 06:01,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12953-014-0049-y [doi]', '49 [pii]']",epublish,Proteome Sci. 2014 Sep 16;12(1):49. doi: 10.1186/s12953-014-0049-y. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'Biomarker', 'Minimal residual disease', 'Serum peptidome']",,PMC4195909,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Proteome Sci. 2020 Oct 24;18:9.

However, the specific functions of these pathways in AML are unclear, thwarting the rational application of targeted therapeutics. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we used a murine model that harbors Mll-AF9 and a tetracycline-repressible, activated NRAS (NRAS(G12V)). Using computational approaches to explore our gene-expression data sets, we found that NRAS(G12V) enforced the leukemia self-renewal gene-expression signature and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9- and Myb-dependent leukemia self-renewal gene-expression program. NRAS(G12V) was required for leukemia self-renewal independent of its effects on growth and survival. Analysis of the gene-expression patterns of leukemic subpopulations revealed that the NRAS(G12V)-mediated leukemia self-renewal signature is preferentially expressed in the leukemia stem cell-enriched subpopulation. In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent signaling, Mac-1(Low) cells, which harbor leukemia stem cells, were preferentially sensitive to NRAS(G12V) withdrawal. NRAS(G12V) maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer stem cell-specific therapies. Together, these experimental results define a RAS oncogene-driven function that is critical for leukemia maintenance and represents a novel mechanism of oncogene addiction.","['Sachs, Zohar', 'LaRue, Rebecca S', 'Nguyen, Hanh T', 'Sachs, Karen', 'Noble, Klara E', 'Mohd Hassan, Nurul Azyan', 'Diaz-Flores, Ernesto', 'Rathe, Susan K', 'Sarver, Aaron L', 'Bendall, Sean C', 'Ha, Ngoc A', 'Diers, Miechaleen D', 'Nolan, Garry P', 'Shannon, Kevin M', 'Largaespada, David A']","['Sachs Z', 'LaRue RS', 'Nguyen HT', 'Sachs K', 'Noble KE', 'Mohd Hassan NA', 'Diaz-Flores E', 'Rathe SK', 'Sarver AL', 'Bendall SC', 'Ha NA', 'Diers MD', 'Nolan GP', 'Shannon KM', 'Largaespada DA']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pediatrics and Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA;', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; and.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'Department of Pediatrics and Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA;', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; Center for Genome Engineering and Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141014,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycine/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oncogenes/physiology', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Valine/genetics']",2014/10/16 06:00,2015/02/25 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35387-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-08-521708 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 20;124(22):3274-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-08-521708.

Using an animal model, we examined the potential of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) transfusion on vascular degeneration after CA induction and underlying mechanisms. CA was induced in the right anterior cerebral artery-olfactory artery (ACA/OA) bifurcations in Sprague-Dawley rats with or without ECFCs transfusion. The degeneration of internal elastic lamina (IEL), media thickness and CA size were evaluated. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2 and 9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The macrophages infiltration and apoptosis of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were examined immunohistologically. Rats in CA+ECFCs transfusion group showed a notable reduction in IEL degeneration, media thinning and CA size compared with those in CA+saline group. ECFCs transfusion inhibited the MMP-driven wall destruction by downregulating MMP-2, MMP-9 expression and upregulating TIMP-1. ECFCs transfusion dramatically decreased VCAM-1 and NF-kappaB expression, increased eNOS expression and caused no change in MCP-1 expression, which was accompanied by reduced macrophages infiltration. Moreover, ECFCs transfusion reversed downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and upregulation of iNOS expression, and decreased SMCs apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that ECFCs transfusion confers protection against degeneration of aneurysmal wall by inhibiting inflammatory cascades and SMCs apoptosis.","['Li, Shengjie', 'Tian, Ye', 'Huang, Xintao', 'Zhang, Yongqiang', 'Wang, Dehui', 'Wei, Huijie', 'Dong, Jingfei', 'Jiang, Rongcai', 'Zhang, Jianning']","['Li S', 'Tian Y', 'Huang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang D', 'Wei H', 'Dong J', 'Jiang R', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin 300052, China; Key Laboratory of Post-trauma Neuro-repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Injuries, Variations and Regeneration of Nervous System, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin 300052, China; Key Laboratory of Post-trauma Neuro-repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Injuries, Variations and Regeneration of Nervous System, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin 300052, China; Key Laboratory of Post-trauma Neuro-repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Injuries, Variations and Regeneration of Nervous System, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin 300052, China; Key Laboratory of Post-trauma Neuro-repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Injuries, Variations and Regeneration of Nervous System, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin 300052, China; Key Laboratory of Post-trauma Neuro-repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Injuries, Variations and Regeneration of Nervous System, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin 300052, China; Key Laboratory of Post-trauma Neuro-repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Injuries, Variations and Regeneration of Nervous System, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Puget Sound Blood Research Institute, 1551 Eastlake Ave E, Seattle, WA 98102, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin 300052, China; Key Laboratory of Post-trauma Neuro-repair and Regeneration in Central Nervous System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin 300052, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Injuries, Variations and Regeneration of Nervous System, Tianjin 300052, China.

In sharp contrast to its insignificant effect on MMP-2, simvastatin down-regulated MMP-9 protein expression and mRNA levels in K562 cells. Simvastatin-induced Pin1 down-regulation evoked NFkappaB/p65 degradation. Meanwhile, simvastatin induced JNK-mediated c-Jun and ATF-2 activation. Over-expression of Pin1 suppressed simvastatin-induced MMP-9 down-regulation. Treatment with SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) or knock-down of JNK1 reduced MMP-2 expression in simvastatin-treated cells. Simvastatin enhanced the binding of c-Jun/ATF-2 with the MMP-2 promoter. Down-regulation of c-Jun or ATF-2 by siRNA revealed that c-Jun/ATF-2 activation was crucial for MMP-2 expression. Suppression of p65 activation or knock-down of Pin1 by shRNA reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in K562 cells. Over-expression of constitutively active JNK1 rescued MMP-2 expression in Pin1 shRNA-transfected cells. Simvastatin treatment also suppressed MMP-9 but not MMP-2 expression in human leukemia U937 and KU812 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that simvastatin-induced p65 instability leads to MMP-9 down-regulation in leukemia cells, while simvastatin-induced JNK1/c-Jun/ATF-2 activation maintains the MMP-2 expression underlying p65 down-regulation.","['Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chen YJ', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.

In the bone marrow, myeloma cells are seen, and vary from mature forms to immature pleomorphic, anaplastic cells. M component is found in the serum or urine in 99% of the patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included all cases of MM diagnosed at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India from March 2003 to August 2004. Clinical findings were recorded and relevant investigations done. RESULTS: Multiple myeloma comprised 11.1% of all hematological malignancies. The mean age was 58.8 years. Bony pain was the most common presenting complaint. Other findings were anemia, raised serum creatinine levels, high serum lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels. Plasmablastic morphology was seen in 60% patients with diffuse marrow involvement being the most common pattern. CONCLUSION: The percentage incidence of Multiple Myeloma, out of all hematological malignancies reported in our study is comparable with other studies as regards to the median age of incidence, male to female ratio, clinical presentation and percentage of M band positivity. However, a higher percentage of our patients had hypercalcemia, higher Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase levels and C -Reactive protein positivity and more lytic lesions. This corresponds with a higher tumor cell burden and a more frequent diffuse pattern of bone marrow involvement in our study group. This could be due to the smaller size of our study group, or due to late referral of patients to our tertiary care hospital.","['Kaur, P', 'Shah, B S', 'Baja, P']","['Kaur P', 'Shah BS', 'Baja P']","['Dr. Puneet Kaur, Assistant professor, Pathology, Giansagar Medical College and Hospital, Banur, Dist Patiala, Punjab.

However, the successful application of modified DLI depended not only on the reduction of severe GVHD, but also on the preservation of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Therefore, this study was performed to compare the impact of prophylaxis for 6-8 weeks and prophylaxis for <6 weeks on GVL effect after modified DLI in haploidentical HSCT. METHODS: A total of 103 consecutive patients developing hematological relapse or minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive status after haploidentical HSCT and receiving modified DLI were investigated retrospectively. Fifty-two patients received prophylaxis for 6-8 weeks after modified DLI; the remaining 51 patients received prophylaxis for <6 weeks. RESULTS: First, compared with prophylaxis for <6 weeks, prophylaxis for 6-8 weeks reduced incidence of relapse in total patients (26.6% vs. 69.0%, P < 0.001). Besides, prophylaxis for 6-8 weeks also reduced incidence of relapse in 54 patients developing hematological relapse post-transplant (P = 0.018) and in 49 patients developing MRD-positive status post-transplant (P < 0.001). Second, prophylaxis for 6-8 weeks reduced incidence of acute GVHD (P < 0.05), reduced the therapeutic application of immunosuppressive agents (P = 0.019), but increased the incidence of chronic GVHD (P < 0.05). Third, prophylaxis for 6-8 weeks improved overall survival and disease-free survival in total patients, as well as in patients developing hematological relapse post-transplant and in patients developing MRD-positive status post-transplant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In haploidentical HSCT, prophylaxis for 6-8 weeks after modified DLI does not reduce GVL effect, but reduces the incidence of DLI-associated acute GVHD compared with prophylaxis for <6 weeks. This strategy will probably improve the safety and efficacy of modified DLI further.","['Yan, Chenhua', 'Xu, Lanping', 'Liu, Daihong', 'Chen, Huan', 'Wang, Yu', 'Liu, Kaiyan', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Yan C', 'Xu L', 'Liu D', 'Chen H', 'Wang Y', 'Liu K', 'Huang X']","[""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China.

A total of 1285 patients received a second allogeneic transplant after disease relapse; among these, 325 were relapse free at 1 year after the second HCT. The median time from first to second HCT was 17 and 24 months for children and adults, respectively. A myeloablative preparative regimen was used in the second transplantation in 62% of children and 45% of adult patients. The overall 10-year conditional survival rates after second transplantation in this cohort of patients who had survived disease-free for at least 1 year was 55% in children and 39% in adults. Relapse was the leading cause of mortality (77% and 54% of deaths in children and adults, respectively). In multivariate analyses, only disease status before second HCT was significantly associated with higher risk for overall mortality (hazard ratio, 1.71 for patients with disease not in complete remission before second HCT, P < .01). Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 43% and 75% of children and adults after second transplantation. Chronic GVHD was the leading cause of nonrelapse mortality, followed by organ failure and infection. The cumulative incidence of developing at least 1 of the studied late effects within 10 years after second HCT was 63% in children and 55% in adults. The most frequent late effects in children were growth disturbance (10-year cumulative incidence, 22%) and cataracts (20%); in adults they were cataracts (20%) and avascular necrosis (13%). Among patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes who receive a second allogeneic HCT for relapse and survive disease free for at least 1 year, many can be expected to survive long term. However, they continue to be at risk for relapse and nonrelapse morbidity and mortality.

We evaluated pediatric cancer caregivers' perceived financial burden related to socioeconomic factors (eg, parental employment) and health care use factors (eg, unexpected hospitalizations). METHODS: A single-site, cross-sectional survey of primary caretakers of patients with childhood cancer was performed from July 2010 to July 2012. Eligible patients were treated at a pediatric cancer hospital, diagnosed at age </= 21 years and were </= 5 years from diagnosis (N = 254). Financial burden was rated on a visual analog scale of 0 to 100. Multivariable linear regression models were used to calculate coefficients and 95% CIs of financial burden by time since diagnosis. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 6.8 years (SD = 5.5 years), and average time since diagnosis was 1.6 years (SD = 1.4 years). The most common diagnosis was leukemia (41.9%). When adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis, insurance status, and rural residence, caregivers whose child was 1 to 5 years from diagnosis with >/= 5 unexpected hospitalizations experienced 24.9 (95% CI, 9.1 to 40.7; P < .01) points higher financial burden than those with no unexpected hospitalizations. In addition, when compared with families without employment disruptions, families of children 1 to 5 years from diagnosis in which a caregiver had quit or changed jobs reported 13.4 (95% CI, 3.2 to 23.6; P = .01) points higher financial burden. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce unexpected hospitalizations and employment disruptions by providing more comprehensive supportive care for pediatric patients with cancer could help ease families' financial burden.","['Warner, Echo L', 'Kirchhoff, Anne C', 'Nam, Gina E', 'Fluchel, Mark']","['Warner EL', 'Kirchhoff AC', 'Nam GE', 'Fluchel M']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute; and University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT echo.warner@hci.utah.edu.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute; and University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute; and University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute; and University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141014,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Caregivers/*economics/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cost of Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*economics', 'Parents', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Utah', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/16 06:00,2014/10/16 06:01,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/16 06:01 [medline]']","['JOP.2014.001495 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2014.001495 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2015 Jan;11(1):12-8. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2014.001495.

Retrospective studies report poor outcomes after HMT failure. Here, we analyzed the outcomes of patients suffering HMT failure. Of 149 patients with MDS treated with either azacitidine or decitabine, 91 who experienced HMT failure were included in the study. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.1 months: 16.2 months for lower-risk MDS and 9.3 months for higher-risk MDS. Disease status and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the time of HMT failure were independent prognostic factors for OS. Fifty-four patients received one or more treatment modalities, and 23 received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The objective response to non-transplant treatments was poor (11-17%), whereas 17 transplanted patients showed a complete response. OS probability at 2 yr post-HCT was 60.9%: 78.6% for patients receiving HCT during MDS and 33.3% for those receiving HCT after developing AML. In conclusion, the clinical outcome of patients after HMT failure was poor. Long-term disease-free survival was observed in approximately 50% of patients who received allogeneic HCT. Therefore, allogeneic HCT should be performed early in appropriate patients, and particularly before progression to AML.","['Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Kim, Sung-Doo', 'Kim, Dae-Young', 'Lee, Jung-Hee', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Lee, Sang-Min', 'Lee, Won-Sik', 'Joo, Young-Don']","['Lee JH', 'Choi Y', 'Kim SD', 'Kim DY', 'Lee JH', 'Lee KH', 'Lee SM', 'Lee WS', 'Joo YD']","['Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Busan Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Busan Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150107,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Failure', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/16 06:00,2016/02/04 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12469 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Jun;94(6):546-53. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12469.

Lower survival among older people has been reported in both conditions, but newer treatments may change both the overall survival rate and the relative risk associated with aging. Here, we examine survival for patients with CLL and CML in the United States (US) and England. METHODS: Patients with CLL and CML were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (US) and National Cancer Registry (England). Five-year relative survival was calculated by major age group. Excess hazard ratios (EHR) by age were calculated for each condition, and multivariable analysis was performed to adjust for the following potential confounders: gender, race or ethnic group (US only), period of diagnosis, and a measure of socioeconomic deprivation (England only). RESULTS: Five-year relative survival increased for both CLL and CML in both England and the US between 1996-2000 and 2006-2010. However, relative age-related disparities persisted. For CLL, the EHR for death was 9.44 (7.84-11.36) in the US and 6.14 (5.65-6.68) in England for ages 85+ compared to ages 55-64. For CML, the EHR was 3.52 (3.17-3.90) in the US and 4.54 (4.13-4.98) in England for ages 75+ compared to ages 45-64. CONCLUSIONS: Survival improved for patients with chronic leukemias in the early 21st century. However, age-related disparities persist, despite clinical trial evidence that treatment in older adults with chronic leukemia can be safe and effective. Further research to determine the reasons for the lower survival in older patients and greater awareness of this problem may improve survival for older patients with chronic leukemia.","['Pulte, Dianne', 'Redaniel, Maria Theresa', 'Bird, Jenny', 'Jeffreys, Mona']","['Pulte D', 'Redaniel MT', 'Bird J', 'Jeffreys M']","['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cardeza Foundation for Hematologic Research, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20150204,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Healthcare Disparities', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/history/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/history/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'SEER Program', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/16 06:00,2016/02/04 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12468 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Jun;94(6):540-5. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12468.

The patient was initially typed as a C*06:02, 06:04 with two nucleotide mismatches in exon 3, (C to T and T to G changes) which would have resulted in a non-synonymous mutation of a leucine residue being replaced with tryptophan. Further resolution of the patient's type by using sequence-specific primers (SSP) revealed that the companion allele to C*06:02 was a novel C*17:01. Confirmation of the existence of the new allele was performed across multiple platforms: Sanger sequencing, SSP, and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on the original sample and allele-specific clones for the entire HLA-C locus. The investigation revealed a single nucleotide mismatch within the Sanger sequencing primer binding site in intron 3. The mutation caused the initial C*17 dropout in exons 2 and 3. Further analysis of the Sanger and NGS data revealed that the C*17 had two additional unique positions in introns 2 and 7. The companion C*06:02 allele also possessed a novel position at intron 3. On August 31, 2013, the WHO nomenclature committee officially named the novel C*17:01 allele sequence as C*17:01:01:03 and the novel C*06:02 allele sequence as C*06:02:01:03.","['Cheng, Christopher', 'Kashi, Zahra Mehdizadeh', 'Martin, Russell', 'Woodruff, Gillian', 'Dinauer, David', 'Agostini, Tina']","['Cheng C', 'Kashi ZM', 'Martin R', 'Woodruff G', 'Dinauer D', 'Agostini T']","['Kashi Clinical Laboratories, Inc., 10101 SW Barbur Blvd., Ste. 200, Portland, OR 97219, USA.', 'Kashi Clinical Laboratories, Inc., 10101 SW Barbur Blvd., Ste. 200, Portland, OR 97219, USA.', 'Kashi Clinical Laboratories, Inc., 10101 SW Barbur Blvd., Ste. 200, Portland, OR 97219, USA.

Migration and adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells play key roles in initiation and development of atherosclerosis. We investigated monocyte-endothelial cell interactions and potential signaling pathways under uric acid (UA)-stimulated conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured and exposed to different concentrations of UA for various periods. Experimental hyperuricemia rat models were established. Expression of chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 8 (IL-8), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were evaluated. Monocyte-endothelial cell interactions were elucidated by chemotaxis and adhesion assays, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway was studied using fluorescent microscopy and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Results showed that high concentration of UA stimulated generation of chemokines and adhesion molecules in ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Migration and adhesion of human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 cells to HUVECs were promoted and activated NF-kappaB was significantly increased. UA-induced responses were ameliorated by organic anion transporter inhibitor probenecid and NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY11-7082. It was also observed that human endothelial cells expressed urate transporter-1, which was not regulated by UA. CONCLUSION: High concentration of UA exerts unfavorable effects directly on vascular endothelium via the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, the process of which requires intracellular uptake of UA.","['Liang, W Y', 'Zhu, X Y', 'Zhang, J W', 'Feng, X R', 'Wang, Y C', 'Liu, M L']","['Liang WY', 'Zhu XY', 'Zhang JW', 'Feng XR', 'Wang YC', 'Liu ML']","['Department of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Peking University Shougang Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.

METHOD: Thirty-eight adult survivors of ALL were randomly selected from a large cohort treated with cranial radiation therapy (19 with 18 Gy and 19 with 24 Gy of exposure). At a mean age of 26.4 (range, 22.3-37.4) years, and 23.5 (range, 20.4-32.8) years since diagnosis, patients underwent comprehensive neurocognitive evaluations and brain (18)F-FDG PET imaging during a resting condition. (18)F-FDG PET images were analyzed stereotactically, and pixel values were normalized to global activity. Predefined region-of-interest and voxel-based correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with national norms, survivors demonstrated lower vocabulary (P < 0.001), reading (P < 0.001), mathematics (P < 0.001), working memory (P < 0.001), oral naming speed (P < 0.001), and cognitive flexibility (P < 0.001). Metabolic activity was higher in basal gangliar structures for those treated with 24 Gy of cranial radiation therapy (P = 0.04). Metabolic activity was positively correlated with oral naming speed in both lateral frontal lobes (rho = 0.48 and 0.47 for right and left frontal regions, respectively, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with cognitive flexibility in the sections of the basal ganglia (P < 0.01 for both caudate and putamen). CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive impairment in long-term survivors of ALL treated with cranial radiation appears to be associated with increased metabolic activity in frontal cerebral cortical and subcortical regions in the basal ganglia, suggesting decreased efficiency of the frontostriatal brain circuit.","['Krull, Kevin R', 'Minoshima, Satoshi', 'Edelmann, Michelle', 'Morris, Brannon', 'Sabin, Noah D', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Shulkin, Barry']","['Krull KR', 'Minoshima S', 'Edelmann M', 'Morris B', 'Sabin ND', 'Brinkman TM', 'Armstrong GT', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Shulkin B']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee kevin.krull@stjude.org."", 'Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Athens Neurological Associates, Athens, Georgia.', ""Department of Radiological Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; and."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Radiological Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; and.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141014,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Brain/*metabolism/radiation effects', '*Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/etiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/16 06:00,2015/02/27 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jnumed.114.142950 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.114.142950 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2014 Nov;55(11):1805-10. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.114.142950.

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine), benefit some MDS/AML patients. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor-induced DNA hypomethylation in regulation of gene expression in AML is unclear. RESULTS: We compared the effects of 5-azacytidine on DNA methylation and gene expression using whole-genome single-nucleotide bisulfite-sequencing and RNA-sequencing in OCI-AML3 cells. For data analysis, we used an approach recently developed for discovery of differential patterns of DNA methylation associated with changes in gene expression, that is tailored to single-nucleotide bisulfite-sequencing data (Washington University Interpolated Methylation Signatures). Using this approach, we find that a subset of genes upregulated by 5-azacytidine are characterized by 5-azacytidine-induced signature methylation loss flanking the transcription start site. Many of these genes show increased methylation and decreased expression in OCI-AML3 cells compared to normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, these genes are preferentially upregulated by decitabine in human primary AML blasts, and control cell proliferation, death, and development. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach identifies a set of genes whose methylation and silencing in AML is reversed by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. These genes are good candidates for direct regulation by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and their reactivation by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors may contribute to therapeutic activity.","['Lund, Kirstin', 'Cole, John J', 'VanderKraats, Nathan D', 'McBryan, Tony', 'Pchelintsev, Nikolay A', 'Clark, William', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Edwards, John R', 'Adams, Peter D']","['Lund K', 'Cole JJ', 'VanderKraats ND', 'McBryan T', 'Pchelintsev NA', 'Clark W', 'Copland M', 'Edwards JR', 'Adams PD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140830,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']",2014/10/16 06:00,2015/06/25 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['s13059-014-0406-2 [pii]', '10.1186/s13059-014-0406-2 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2014 Aug 30;15(8):406. doi: 10.1186/s13059-014-0406-2.,,,"['4-R00-CA127360-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM108811/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'SCD/04/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', '1R21LM011199-01/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 LM011199/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA127360/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4165364,,,['Genome Biol. 2014;15(9):441.

There are most common cases of MYC/8q24 and BCL2/18q21 gene rearrangements (MYC/BCL-2 DH lymphoma). The tumor is characterized by an aggressive clinical course and a poor response to chemotherapy (CT). The median survival in patients with DH lymphomas varies from 4.5 to 18 months. Such patients are generally resistant to CHOP-21 and R-CHOP-21 therapy regimens. For the treatment of patients with DH lymphoma, the Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, chose an original BL-M-04 polychemotherapy (PCT) protocol in combination with rituximab, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The paper describes the experience in successfully treating a patient with two hematologic tumors: 1) MYC/BCL-2 DH lymphoma with high-dose PCT cycles, followed by allo-SCT, and 2) a metachronously developed second tumor (acute myelomonoblastic leukemia (AMML)) with CT cycles, followed by auto-SCT. The incidence of tumors induced by the previous high-dose CT for aggressive lymphomas for 10 years is 0.7 to 10%. As a rule, the development of secondary AMML is preceded by a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); characteristic chromosomal abnormalities (deletions of the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7) are detectable. In this case, the follow-up was 3 months before the development of AMML, during this period the patient was not found to have laboratory signs of MDS (anemia, thrombocytopenia) or chromosomal abnormalities associated with secondary MDS/AML. The presence of a leukemic stem cell is associated with the occurrence and development of hemoblastosis; that of the similar cell populations that may cause B-cell lymphomas remains uncertain. The described case may have defect in a hematopoietic stem cell that gives rise to both germs of hematopoiesis, as well as complete donor chimerism of bone marrow hematopoiesis, which gives hope to long-term remission in both DH lymphoma and AMML.","['Lukina, A E', 'Bariakh, E A', 'Kravchenko, S K', 'Nareiko, M V', ""Kuz'mina, L A"", 'Parovichnikova, E N', 'Obukhova, T N', 'Kovrigina, A M', 'Magomedova, A U']","['Lukina AE', 'Bariakh EA', 'Kravchenko SK', 'Nareiko MV', ""Kuz'mina LA"", 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Obukhova TN', 'Kovrigina AM', 'Magomedova AU']",,['rus'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/10/16 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2014;86(7):80-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The results of examining 44 patients aged 11 to 70 years were analyzed; the efficiency of treatment was evaluated in 36. Their karyotypes were studied using the standard GTG method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to assess the mutational status of the FLT3, NPM1, NRAS and c-Kit genes. Qualitative PCR was used to reveal the chimeric transcript RUNX1/RUNX1T1. RESULTS: The M2 variant was verified using the French-American-British classification in 82% of cases. One patient was diagnosed with secondary AML. Additional chromosomal aberrations were found in 50% of the patients. The most common breakages were loss of one of the sex chromosomes (34.1%) and damage of chromosome 9 (16.6%). Gene mutations were detected in single cases. Following 2 7+3 induction chemotherapy (CT) cycles, complete remission (CR) was achieved in 97% of cases (3 patients with cytopenia died). Eight (25%) patients developed a relapse mainly within the first 7 months after achieving CR. The characteristic signs of relapse cases were the inefficiency of the first cycle of remission induction (RI), the absence of high-dose consolidation, damage of chromosome 9, D816V mutation in exone 17 of the c-Kit gene. Antirecurrent CT was ineffective in 5 patients. The median overall survival (OS) in patients with early recurrence was 10 months. That in the patients who were recorded to have CR was not achieved; 5-year OS was 57.8%. Chromosome 9 aberration was ascertained to have a negative impact on OS parameters (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Patients with AML with t(8;21) is a group heterogeneous with respect to age, the morphological nature of blast cells, the pattern of the disease, the presence and type of additional chromosomal aberrations, mutations in individual genes, and clinical course. Those who are unresponsive to the first RI cycle and have additional chromosome 9 damages should be regarded as potential candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Gritsaev, S V', 'Martynkevich, I S', 'Ziuzgin, I S', 'Kariagina, E V', 'Martynenko, L S', 'Petrova, E V', 'Tsybakova, N Iu', 'Ivanova, M P', 'Kostroma, I I', 'Tiranova, S A', 'Potikhonova, N A', 'Abdulkadyrov, K M']","['Gritsaev SV', 'Martynkevich IS', 'Ziuzgin IS', 'Kariagina EV', 'Martynenko LS', 'Petrova EV', 'Tsybakova NIu', 'Ivanova MP', 'Kostroma II', 'Tiranova SA', 'Potikhonova NA', 'Abdulkadyrov KM']",,['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2014/10/16 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2014;86(7):45-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation included 20 patients with multiple primary synchronous and metachronous myeloid and lymphoid tumors, who had been followed up at the Outpatient Department of the Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The distribution of patients by nosological entities was as follows: 17 (85%) patients with myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs) concurrent with lymphoproliferative diseases (LPDs) and 3 (15%) with two types of MPD. A special group comprised 3 patients who successively developed 3 malignant diseases: cancer/B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)/Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+CML); cancer/polycythemia vera (PCV)/B-CLL; cancer/essential thrombocythemia (ETC)/multiple myeloma (MM). RESULTS: The Outpatient Department of the Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, followed up 20 patients with synchronous and metachronous tumors in 1996 to 2013. The patients' age was 42 to 82 years (64 years). The female/male ratio was 1:1.2. Metachronous tumors were 1.5-fold higher than synchronous ones. The time to detection of secondary hemoblastosis averaged 3.3 years; the longest interval was 14 years; the mean coexistence of 2 tumors was 4.8 years (1-11 years). The total length of the follow-up was 8 years (1-19 years).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A planned epidemiological prospective study was conducted in 2009-2012 in 6 Russian regions with the total number of 10.1 million inhabitants, which notified all new CML cases. RESULTS: The unstandardized (unnormalized, baseline) recorded incidence of CML in the examined regions was 0.58 per 100,000 annually. Its standardized (normalized) incidence was 0.70 for the WHO standard population and 0.72 for the European standard population. The regional variations in the incidence were 0.44 to 0.69. The structural analysis of the incidence in the age strata indicated that the overall morbidity was less due to the decreased rate of registration in old age groups. The morbidity rates in patients aged less than 60 years were nearly similar to the European rates; those in patients aged over 70 years were almost 10 times lower. The lower rate of detection and screening diagnosis of CML in pensioners in primary health care is discussed.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In January 2010 to October 2013, a Russian multicenter trial was conducted to treat patients with acute myeloid leukemias (AML) in accordance with the AML-01.10 protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01587430). The trial enrolled 243 AML patients from 21 centers, including 71 patients (median age 38 years) from the State Hematology Center, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation; 35 and 36 patients were randomized to Groups 1 and 2, respectively. The randomized groups were balanced by basic clinical and laboratory parameters. Favorable, intermediate, and high cytogenetic prognoses were in 14 (21.9%), 40 (62.5%), and 10 (15.6%) patients, respectively. RESULTS: Prior to treatment, 2 patients died; one patient refused treatment. Fifty-eight (85.3%) of the 68 patients achieved complete remission (CR); early deaths was in 2 (2.9%) and resistance in 8 (11.8%). Four (6.9%) patients died during CR. Protocol deviations (doses, intervals, and the number of cycles) were recorded in 12 (20.7%) of the 58 patients. Other 8 (11.8%) patients were switched to low-dose cytarabine because of complications, withdrawn from the protocol and not included into the analysis of randomized comparison. Twenty allogeneic bone marrow transplantations (allo-BMT) (7 related, 12 unrelated, and 1 haploidentical) were performed; of them 15 allo-BMTs were done during first CR. In the 68 patients, 3-year overall survival (OS) was 45.6%; relapse-free survival (RFS) was 41.5%. OS was 64.6% in Group 1 and 58.3% in Group 2; RFS was 62 and 38.8% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p>0.5). In the favorable, intermediate, and high prognosis groups, OS was 79.5, 60, and 31.1% and RFS was 81.8, 41.3, and 33.3%, respectively (p=0.1). The consolidation treatment option unchanged survival rates in the above risk groups. Unachieved CR after the first cycle considerably decreased RFS (33.9% versus 60%) and served as an indication for allo-BMT during first CP (RFS without BMT was 0; that with BMT was 78%). CONCLUSION: No differences were found between both consolidation options according to long-term results. Protocol deviations were recorded in one-third of the patients. While implementing the protocol, the efficiency of treatment was high. Allo-BMT during first CR substantially increased RFS if CP was not achieved after the first cycle.","['Parovichnikova, E N', 'Troitskaia, V V', 'Kliasova, G A', ""Kuz'mina, L A"", 'Sokolov, A N', 'Paramonova, E V', 'Galstian, G M', ""Kessel'man, S A"", 'Drokov, M Iu', ""Vasil'eva, V A"", 'Obukhova, T N', 'Kulikov, S M', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Parovichnikova EN', 'Troitskaia VV', 'Kliasova GA', ""Kuz'mina LA"", 'Sokolov AN', 'Paramonova EV', 'Galstian GM', ""Kessel'man SA"", 'Drokov MIu', ""Vasil'eva VA"", 'Obukhova TN', 'Kulikov SM', 'Savchenko VG']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Russia']",2014/10/16 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/10/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2014;86(7):14-23.,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01587430'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we established a mouse model of AML by syngeneic transplantation of BXH-2 derived myeloid leukemic cells and developed an efficacious Ara-C-based regimen for treatment of these mice. We proved that leukemic cell load was correlated with survival. We also demonstrated that the susceptibility of leukemia cells to Ara-C could significantly affect the survival. To examine the molecular alterations in cells with different sensitivity, genome-wide expression of the leukemic cells was profiled, revealing that overall 366 and 212 genes became upregulated or downregulated, respectively, in the resistant cells. Many of these genes are involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Some of them were further validated by quantitative PCR. Interestingly, the Ara-C resistant cells retained the sensitivity to ABT-737, an inhibitor of anti-apoptosis proteins, and treatment with ABT-737 prolonged the life span of mice engrafted with resistant cells. These results suggest that leukemic load and intrinsic cellular resistance can affect the outcome of AML treated with Ara-C. Incorporation of apoptosis inhibitors, such as ABT-737, into traditional cytotoxic regimens merits consideration for the treatment of AML in a subset of patients with resistance to Ara-C. This work provided direct in vivo evidence that leukemic load and intrinsic cellular resistance can affect the outcome of AML treated with Ara-C, suggesting that incorporation of apoptosis inhibitors into traditional cytotoxic regimens merits consideration for the treatment of AML in a subset of patients with resistance to Ara-C.","['Zhao, Wenjun', 'Wei, Lirong', 'Tan, Dongming', 'Su, Guangsong', 'Zheng, Yanwen', 'He, Chao', 'Mao, Zhengwei J', 'Singleton, Timothy P', 'Yin, Bin']","['Zhao W', 'Wei L', 'Tan D', 'Su G', 'Zheng Y', 'He C', 'Mao ZJ', 'Singleton TP', 'Yin B']","['Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Medical Center-Fairview, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Department of Laboratory of Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China; Thrombosis and Hemostasis Key Lab of the Ministry of Health, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141014,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109198 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-13522 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 14;9(10):e109198. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109198. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4196759,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used minimalistic reconstituted systems to examine the influence of mitochondrial lipids on MCL1 activity and conformation. Site-directed mutagenesis and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses revealed that the BCL2 homology region of MCL1 (MCL1DeltaNDeltaC) inhibits permeabilization of MOM-like membranes exclusively via canonical BH3-into-groove interactions with both cBID-like activators and BAX-like effectors. Contrary to currently popular models, MCL1DeltaNDeltaC did not require becoming embedded into the membrane to inhibit membrane permeabilization, and interaction with cBID was more productive for MCL1DeltaNDeltaC inhibitory activity than interaction with BAX. We also report that membranes rich in cardiolipin (CL), but not phosphatidylinositol (PI), trigger a profound conformational change in MCL1DeltaNDeltaC leading to membrane integration and unleashment of an intrinsic lipidic pore-forming activity of the molecule. Cholesterol (CHOL) reduces both the conformational change and the lipidic pore-forming activity of MCL1DeltaNDeltaC in CL-rich membranes, but it does not affect the interaction of MCL1DeltaNDeltaC with proapoptotic partners in MOM-like liposomes. In addition, we identified MCL1alpha5 as the minimal domain of the protein responsible for its membrane-permeabilizing function both in model membranes and at the mitochondrial level. Our results provide novel mechanistic insight into MCL1 function in the context of a membrane milieu and add significantly to a growing body of evidence supporting an active role of mitochondrial membrane lipids in BCL2 protein function.","['Landeta, Olatz', 'Garcia Valero, Juan', 'Flores-Romero, Hector', 'Bustillo-Zabalbeitia, Itsasne', 'Landajuela, Ane', 'Garcia-Porras, Miguel', 'Terrones, Oihana', 'Basanez, Gorka']","['Landeta O', 'Garcia Valero J', 'Flores-Romero H', 'Bustillo-Zabalbeitia I', 'Landajuela A', 'Garcia-Porras M', 'Terrones O', 'Basanez G']","['Unidad de Biofisica, Centro Mixto Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea/Universidad del Pais Vasco (EHU/UPV) , Barrio Sarriena s/n, Leioa 48940, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141022,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cardiolipins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb500592e [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2014 Dec 19;9(12):2852-63. doi: 10.1021/cb500592e.

Elements of answer from a large-scale cohort study in France.,185-93,10.1038/bjc.2014.526 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological results suggested an increase of cancer risk after receiving computed tomography (CT) scans in childhood or adolescence. Their interpretation is questioned due to the lack of information about the reasons for examination. Our objective was to estimate the cancer risk related to childhood CT scans, and examine how cancer-predisposing factors (PFs) affect assessment of the radiation-related risk. METHODS: The cohort included 67,274 children who had a first scan before the age of 10 years from 2000 to 2010 in 23 French departments. Cumulative X-rays doses were estimated from radiology protocols. Cancer incidence was retrieved through the national registry of childhood cancers; PF from discharge diagnoses. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 4 years, 27 cases of tumours of the central nervous system, 25 of leukaemia and 21 of lymphoma were diagnosed; 32% of them among children with PF. Specific patterns of CT exposures were observed according to PFs. Adjustment for PF reduced the excess risk estimates related to cumulative doses from CT scans. No significant excess risk was observed in relation to CT exposures. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the indication for examinations, whether suspected cancer or PF management, should be considered to avoid overestimation of the cancer risks associated with CT scans.","['Journy, N', 'Rehel, J-L', 'Ducou Le Pointe, H', 'Lee, C', 'Brisse, H', 'Chateil, J-F', 'Caer-Lorho, S', 'Laurier, D', 'Bernier, M-O']","['Journy N', 'Rehel JL', 'Ducou Le Pointe H', 'Lee C', 'Brisse H', 'Chateil JF', 'Caer-Lorho S', 'Laurier D', 'Bernier MO']","['Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Medical Radiation Protection Expertise Unit, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Radiology, Trousseau University Hospital, 26 avenue du Docteur Arnold-Netter, 75012 Paris, France.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, 20892 Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Institut Curie, 11-13 rue Pierre et Marie Curie, 75005 Paris, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Radiology, Pellegrin University Hospital, Place Amelie Raba-Leon, 33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141014,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*statistics & numerical data']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2014526 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2014.526 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2015 Jan 6;112(1):185-93. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.526.

Viral vectors have been used to genetically modify in vitro expanded NK cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which confer cytotoxicity against tumors. However, use of viral transduction methods raises the safety concern of viral integration into the NK cell genome. In this study, we used trogocytosis as a non-viral method to modify NK cells for immunotherapy. A K562 cell line expressing high levels of anti-CD19 CARs was generated as a donor cell to transfer the anti-CD19 CARs onto NK cells via trogocytosis. Anti-CD19 CAR expression was observed in expanded NK cells after these cells were co-cultured for one hour with freeze/thaw-treated donor cells expressing anti-CD19 CARs. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the localization of the anti-CD19 CARs on the NK cell surface. Acquisition of anti-CD19 CARs via trogocytosis enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against the B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell lines and primary B-ALL cells derived from patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes the increased cytotoxicity of NK cells following the acquisition of CARs via trogocytosis. This novel strategy could be a potential valuable therapeutic approach for the treatment of B-cell tumors.","['Cho, Fu-Nan', 'Chang, Tsung-Hsien', 'Shu, Chih-Wen', 'Ko, Ming-Chin', 'Liao, Shuen-Kuei', 'Wu, Kang-Hsi', 'Yu, Ming-Sun', 'Lin, Shyh-Jer', 'Hong, Ying-Chung', 'Chen, Chien-Hsun', 'Hung, Chien-Hui', 'Chang, Yu-Hsiang']","['Cho FN', 'Chang TH', 'Shu CW', 'Ko MC', 'Liao SK', 'Wu KH', 'Yu MS', 'Lin SJ', 'Hong YC', 'Chen CH', 'Hung CH', 'Chang YH']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery and Center of Excellence for Cancer Research, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital and School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospitals, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'Haematology-Oncology Section, Department of Medicine, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Haematology-Oncology Section, Department of Medicine, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Haematology-Oncology Section, Department of Medicine, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Nursing, Tajen University, Yanpu Township, Pingtung County, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141014,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109352 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-18128 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 14;9(10):e109352. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109352. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4196898,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the persistent STAT3 signaling pathway results in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in human cancer cells, indicating that STAT3 is a viable molecular target for cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated a novel non-peptide, cell-permeable small molecule, named LY5, to target STAT3 in medulloblastoma cells. LY5 inhibited persistent STAT3 phosphorylation and induced apoptosis in human medulloblastoma cell lines expressing constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling by LY5 was confirmed by down-regulating the expression of the downstream targets of STAT3, including cyclin D1, bcl-XL, survivin, and micro-RNA-21. LY5 also inhibited the induction of STAT3 phosphorylation by interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2, and leukemia inhibitory factor in medulloblastoma cells, but did not inhibit STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation stimulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and EGF, respectively. In addition, LY5 blocked the STAT3 nuclear localization induced by IL-6, but did not block STAT1 and STAT5 nuclear translocation mediated by IFN-gamma and EGF, respectively. A combination of LY5 with cisplatin or x-ray radiation also showed more potent effects than single treatment alone in the inhibition of cell viability in human medulloblastoma cells. Furthermore, LY5 demonstrated a potent inhibitory activity on cell migration and angiogenesis. Taken together, these findings indicate LY5 inhibits persistent and inducible STAT3 phosphorylation and suggest that LY5 is a promising therapeutic drug candidate for medulloblastoma by inhibiting persistent STAT3 signaling.","['Xiao, Hui', 'Bid, Hemant Kumar', 'Jou, David', 'Wu, Xiaojuan', 'Yu, Wenying', 'Li, Chenglong', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Lin, Jiayuh']","['Xiao H', 'Bid HK', 'Jou D', 'Wu X', 'Yu W', 'Li C', 'Houghton PJ', 'Lin J']","[""From the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43205 and."", ""From the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43205 and."", ""From the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43205 and."", ""From the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43205 and."", 'the Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'the Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', ""From the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43205 and."", ""From the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43205 and lin.674@osu.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141013,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (5,8-dioxo-6-(pyridin-3-ylamino)-5,8-dihydronaphthalene-1-sulfonamide)', '0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Aminopyridines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cyclin D/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Medulloblastoma/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)49190-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.616748 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Feb 6;290(6):3418-29. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.616748.

However, it has pleiotropic effects, and the mechanism of action responsible for its therapeutic activity has not been well defined yet. Herein, we show that lenalidomide treatment does not have an effect on the proliferation of leukemia cells, but it increases the proliferation of B cells from healthy donors. Lenalidomide did not exert a direct effect on the apoptosis of leukemia cells obtained from CLL patients, although it indirectly induced their apoptosis through the activation of nonmalignant immune cells. Thus, lenalidomide markedly increased the proliferation of NK and CD4 T cells. The effect of lenalidomide on NK cells was secondary to the induction of IL-2 production by CD4 T cells. Accordingly, depletion of T cells or blockade of IL-2 activity completely abrogated the proliferation of NK cells. Additionally, lenalidomide enhanced NK and NKT-like cell-mediated natural cytotoxicity against leukemia cells from CLL patients. Lenalidomide also upregulated CD20 expression on leukemia cells and, accordingly, it had a synergistic effect with rituximab on promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against primary leukemia cells. Overall, these observations provide a support for combining lenalidomide with rituximab as a treatment in CLL.","['Acebes-Huerta, Andrea', 'Huergo-Zapico, Leticia', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ana Pilar', 'Fernandez-Guizan, Azahara', 'Payer, Angel R', 'Lopez-Soto, Alejandro', 'Gonzalez, Segundo']","['Acebes-Huerta A', 'Huergo-Zapico L', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez AP', 'Fernandez-Guizan A', 'Payer AR', 'Lopez-Soto A', 'Gonzalez S']","['Department of Functional Biology, IUOPA, University of Oviedo, Facultad de Medicina, Julian Claveria sn, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, IUOPA, University of Oviedo, Facultad de Medicina, Julian Claveria sn, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, C/Celestino Villamil s/n, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, IUOPA, University of Oviedo, Facultad de Medicina, Julian Claveria sn, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, C/Celestino Villamil s/n, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, IUOPA, University of Oviedo, Facultad de Medicina, Julian Claveria sn, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, IUOPA, University of Oviedo, Facultad de Medicina, Julian Claveria sn, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140917,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/*drug effects', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/265840 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:265840. doi: 10.1155/2014/265840.

This epigenetic alteration can be reversed by 5-aza-2'-deoxcytidine (decitabine, 5-AZA-CdR). Although 5-AZA-CdR can induce complete remissions in patients with AML, most patients relapse. The effectiveness of this therapy may be limited by the inability of 5-AZA-CdR to reactivate all TSGs due to their silencing by other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone methylation or chromatin compaction. EZH2, a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2, catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) to H3K27me3. 3-Deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an inhibitor of methionine metabolism, can reactivate genes silenced by H3K27me3 by its inhibition of EZH2. In a previous report, we observed that 5-AZA-CdR, in combination with DZNep, shows synergistic antineoplastic action against AML cells. Gene silencing due to chromatin compaction is attributable to the action of histone deacetylases (HDAC). This mechanism of epigenetic gene silencing can be reversed by HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin-A (TSA). Silent TSGs that cannot be reactivated by 5-AZA-CdR or DZNep have the potential to be reactivated by TSA. This provides a rationale for the use of HDAC inhibitors in combination with 5-AZA-CdR and DZNep to treat AML. RESULTS: The triple combination of 5-AZA-CdR, DZNep, and TSA induced a remarkable synergistic antineoplastic effect against human AML cells as demonstrated by an in vitro colony assay. This triple combination also showed a potent synergistic activation of several key TSGs as determined by real-time PCR. The triple combination was more effective than the combination of two agents or a single agent. Microarray analysis showed that the triple combination generated remarkable changes in global gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that it may be possible to design a very effective therapy for AML using agents that target the reversal of the following three epigenetic ""lock"" mechanisms that silence gene expression: DNA methylation, histone methylation, and histone deacetylation. This approach merits serious consideration for clinical investigation in patients with advanced AML.","['Momparler, Richard L', 'Cote, Sylvie', 'Momparler, Louise F', 'Idaghdour, Youssef']","['Momparler RL', 'Cote S', 'Momparler LF', 'Idaghdour Y']","[""Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, 2900 Edouard-Montpetit, Montreal, QC H3T 1J4, Canada ; Centre de recherche, Service d'hematologie/oncologie, CHU-Saint-Justine, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1C5, Canada."", ""Centre de recherche, Service d'hematologie/oncologie, CHU-Saint-Justine, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1C5, Canada."", ""Centre de recherche, Service d'hematologie/oncologie, CHU-Saint-Justine, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1C5, Canada."", 'Department of Biology, New York University, Saadiyat Island, PO Box 129188, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141001,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,,,,2014/10/15 06:00,2014/10/15 06:01,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/1868-7083-6-19 [doi]', '1868-7083-6-19 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2014 Oct 1;6(1):19. doi: 10.1186/1868-7083-6-19. eCollection 2014.,['NOTNLM'],"['3-deazaneplanocin-A', ""5-aza-2'-deoxcytidine"", 'Decitabine', 'EZH2', 'Epigenetic therapy', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors', 'Myeloid leukemia']",,PMC4194463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

X-370 abrogated both Akt and Erk1/2 signaling via blockade of PDK1 binding to and/or phosphorylation of MEK1/2. Forced expression of a constitutively active MEK1 attenuated the antiproliferative activity of X-370. X-370 preferentially inhibited the survival of primary pediatric B-ALL cells displaying PI3Kdelta-dependent Erk1/2 phosphorylation, while combined inhibition of PI3Kdelta and MEK1/2 displayed enhanced activity. We conclude that PI3Kdelta inhibition led to abrogation of both Akt and Erk1/2 signaling via a novel PI3K-PDK1/MEK1/2-Erk1/2 signaling cascade, which contributed to its efficacy against B-ALL. These findings support the rationale for clinical testing of PI3Kdelta inhibitors in pediatric B-ALL and provide insights needed to optimize the therapeutic strategy.","['Wang, Xiang', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Li, Ben-shang', 'Zhai, Xiaowen', 'Yang, Zhuo', 'Ding, Li-xia', 'Wang, Hongsheng', 'Liang, Chris', 'Zhu, Weiliang', 'Ding, Jian', 'Meng, Ling-hua']","['Wang X', 'Zhang X', 'Li BS', 'Zhai X', 'Yang Z', 'Ding LX', 'Wang H', 'Liang C', 'Zhu W', 'Ding J', 'Meng LH']","['Division of Anti-Tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Anti-Tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Xcovery, LLC, West Palm Beach, Florida, USA.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Anti-Tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Anti-Tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (PDK1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)', '0 (X-370 compound)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Purines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['2533 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2533 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Nov 15;5(21):10732-44. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2533.,,,,PMC4279406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many interactions, one or both proteins are disordered before association. However, this disorder in the unbound state does not prevent many of these proteins folding to a well-defined, ordered structure in the bound state. Here we examine a typical system, where a small disordered protein (PUMA, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) folds to an alpha-helix when bound to a groove on the surface of a folded protein (MCL-1, induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein). We follow the association of these proteins using rapid-mixing stopped flow, and examine how the kinetic behavior is perturbed by denaturant and carefully chosen mutations. We demonstrate the utility of methods developed for the study of monomeric protein folding, including beta-Tanford values, Leffler alpha, Phi-value analysis, and coarse-grained simulations, and propose a self-consistent mechanism for binding. Folding of the disordered protein before binding does not appear to be required and few, if any, specific interactions are required to commit to association. The majority of PUMA folding occurs after the transition state, in the presence of MCL-1. We also examine the role of the side chains of folded MCL-1 that make up the binding groove and find that many favor equilibrium binding but, surprisingly, inhibit the association process.","['Rogers, Joseph M', 'Oleinikovas, Vladimiras', 'Shammas, Sarah L', 'Wong, Chi T', 'De Sancho, David', 'Baker, Christopher M', 'Clarke, Jane']","['Rogers JM', 'Oleinikovas V', 'Shammas SL', 'Wong CT', 'De Sancho D', 'Baker CM', 'Clarke J']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom jc162@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141013,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Intrinsically Disordered Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/04/18 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1409122111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1409122111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Oct 28;111(43):15420-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1409122111.

We hypothesized that network-based gene expression signatures of AML represent the mechanistically important genes and may improve the predicted performance of prognosis and clinical outcome. We provided the random walk with restart (RWR) analysis to discover the sub-network of genomic alterations. The RWR approach integrates the signature genes derived from the random forest (RF) analysis as ""seeds"" to identify genes critical to the AML recurrence phenotype. To test whether the 81-gene biomarkers could predict AML recurrence, we developed Survival Support Vector Machine (SSVM) models using a gene expression dataset and test on an independent dataset. The random forest classifier was built based on 81-gene biomarkers to separate the AML patients into ""recurrence"" and ""non-recurrence"" groups. The 81-gene biomarkers showed significant enrichment related to cancer pathophysiology and provided good coverage of sub-network biomarkers and AML-related signaling pathways. The SSVM-based score was significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-3.97; p = 0.01). Similar results were obtained with reversed training and testing datasets (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.37; p = 0.02). The 81-gene biomarker based RF classifier improved classification performance. Overall, 81-gene biomarkers might be useful prognostic and predictive molecular markers to predict the clinical outcome of AML patients.","['Shi, Mingguang', 'Wu, Min', 'Pan, Ping', 'Zhao, Rui']","['Shi M', 'Wu M', 'Pan P', 'Zhao R']","['School of Electric Engineering and Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, Anhui 230009, China. mingguang.shi@hfut.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Mol Biosyst,Molecular bioSystems,101251620,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Support Vector Machine', '*Transcriptome']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/08/15 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4mb00440j [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biosyst. 2014 Dec;10(12):3290-7. doi: 10.1039/c4mb00440j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though there are different methods, perfusion method is one of the simple, safe and less contaminated methods used to harvest BMCs and it can reduce the risk in allogenic BMT. Intra bone marrow-bone marrow transfer (IBM-BMT) is one of the best procedures for allogenic BMT. Due to enlisting of hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells, which are derived from donor, this method has distinguishable advantages in allogenic BMT.

Therefore we proposed the usage of human transferrin as a doxorubicin carrier in order to improve the quality of doxorubicin application in conventional chemotherapy. In this study we continue our investigations related to the mechanism of the toxicity of doxorubicin-transferrin (DOX-TRF) conjugate in human leukemia cells. Consequently, we are now concentrating on the influence of this compound on the antioxidative system in K562 and CCRF-CEM cell lines (chronic erythromyeloblastoid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, respectively). We carried out a neutral red cytotoxicity assay, reduced (GSH) and total (GSH + GSSG) glutathione content, alterations in the activity of catalase and enzymes responsible for maintaining glutathione in reduced form. Exposure of leukemia cells to the investigated anticancer agents caused a time-dependent depletion of intracellular GSH, accompanied by an increase of catalase activity. Moreover, analysis of GSH-related enzymes showed a significant increase in the activities of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase after DOX-TRF application. In contrast, glutathione reductase activity was reduced by conjugate treatment to 50%. Significant differences between the pro-oxidative actions of the investigated anticancer compounds were observed in RT-PCR experiments, which confirmed that changes in the activity of catalase and GSH-related enzymes are strictly correlated with their gene transcription changes.","['Szwed, Marzena', 'Kania, Katarzyna D', 'Jozwiak, Zofia']","['Szwed M', 'Kania KD', 'Jozwiak Z']","['Department of Thermobiology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.

NB4 cells were exposed to various concentrations (0-200muM) of ZOL. Cell viability was measured by MTS assay. The extent of cell apoptosis and distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle were analyzed with flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis- and cell cycle-related proteins was assayed by Western blot. The combined effect of ZOL and arsenic trioxide (ATO) on the proliferation of NB4 cells was also determined. The results of this study indicate that ZOL inhibits cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent fashion and also induces apoptosis and S phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. The Western blot analysis confirmed the induction of apoptosis and S phase arrest, revealing that the pro-apoptosis proteins Bax, Puma and activated caspase-9 were upregulated and the anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were downregulated.

As these two miRs are expressed from the same polycistronic transcript, we manipulated MIR144 and MIR451 in human erythroid cells individually and together to investigate their effects on human erythropoiesis. Inhibition of endogenous human MIR451 resulted in decreased numbers of erythroid (CD71(hi) CD235a(hi) CD34(-) ) cells, consistent with prior studies in zebrafish and mice. In addition, inhibition of MIR144 impaired human erythroid differentiation, unlike in zebrafish and mouse studies where the functional effect of MIR144 on erythropoiesis was minimal. In this study, we found RAB14 is a direct target of both MIR144 and MIR451. As MIR144 and MIR451 expression increased during human erythropoiesis, RAB14 protein expression decreased. Enforced RAB14 expression phenocopied the effect of MIR144 and/or MIR451 depletion, whereas shRNA-mediated RAB14 knockdown protected cells from MIR144 and/or MIR451 depletion-mediated erythropoietic inhibition. RAB14 knockdown increased the frequency and number of erythroid cells, increased beta-haemoglobin expression, and decreased CBFA2T3 expression during human erythropoiesis. In summary, we utilized MIR144 and MIR451 to identify RAB14 as a novel physiological inhibitor of human erythropoiesis.","['Kim, MinJung', 'Tan, Yee Sun', 'Cheng, Wen-Chih', 'Kingsbury, Tami J', 'Heimfeld, Shelly', 'Civin, Curt I']","['Kim M', 'Tan YS', 'Cheng WC', 'Kingsbury TJ', 'Heimfeld S', 'Civin CI']","['Departments of Physiology and Pediatrics, Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141014,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN144 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN451 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Rab14 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/04/02 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13164 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Feb;168(4):583-97. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13164.

Here we demonstrate that a novel designed peptide (E5) targeting CXCR4 inhibits CXCL12- and stroma-induced activation in multiple acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cell lines and displays anti-AML activity. We show that E5 has high affinity to multiple AML cells with high CXCR4 level in a concentration dependent manner. E5 significantly inhibits CXCL12- or murine stromal cell (MS-5)-induced migration of leukemia cells and prevents the cells from adhering to stromal cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that E5 down-regulates CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of Akt, Erk, and p38, which affects the cytoskeleton F-actin organization and ultimately results in the inhibition of CXCL12- and stroma-mediated leukemia cell responses. E5 can induce concentration-dependent apoptosis in the four AML cell lines tested while did not affect the viability of MS-5 or human umbilical vein cell (ea.hy926) even at 80 microM, both of which have a low level of CXCR4. In vivo experimental results show that immunocompromised mice transplanted with HL-60 cells survived longer when treated with E5 twice a week in comparison to those treated with cyclophosphamide.","['Li, Xiaojin', 'Guo, Hua', 'Yang, Yanlian', 'Meng, Jie', 'Liu, Jian', 'Wang, Chen', 'Xu, Haiyan']","['Li X', 'Guo H', 'Yang Y', 'Meng J', 'Liu J', 'Wang C', 'Xu H']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, P.

To better represent the impact of such therapies on growth we apply a mathematical model, which accounts both for the gompertzian-like growth trend and the hormone-related 'spurts', and evaluate how the parameter values estimated on the children undergoing TBI differ from those of the matched normal population. METHODS: 25 patients long-term childhood lymphoblastic and myeloid acute leukaemia survivors followed at Pediatric Onco-Hematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital (Turin, Italy) were retrospectively analysed for assessing the influence of TBI on their longitudinal growth and for validating a new method to estimate the GH therapy effects. Six were treated with GH therapy after a GHD diagnosis. RESULTS: We show that when TBI was performed before puberty overall growth and pubertal duration were significantly impaired, but such growth limitations were completely reverted in the small sample (6 over 25) of children who underwent GH replacement therapies. CONCLUSION: Since in principle the model could account for any additional growth 'spurt' induced by therapy, it may become a useful 'simulation' tool for paediatricians for comparing the predicted therapy effectiveness depending on its timing and dosage.","['Galletto, Chiara', 'Gliozzi, Antonio', 'Nucera, Daniele', 'Bertorello, Nicoletta', 'Biasin, Eleonora', 'Corrias, Andrea', 'Chiabotto, Patrizia', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Guiot, Caterina']","['Galletto C', 'Gliozzi A', 'Nucera D', 'Bertorello N', 'Biasin E', 'Corrias A', 'Chiabotto P', 'Fagioli F', 'Guiot C']","[""Pediatric Onco-Hematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, piazza Polonia 94, 10126 Turin, Italy. chiara_galletto@libero.it.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141013,England,Theor Biol Med Model,Theoretical biology & medical modelling,101224383,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2014/10/15 06:00,2015/10/30 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4682-11-44 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4682-11-44 [doi]']",epublish,Theor Biol Med Model. 2014 Oct 13;11:44. doi: 10.1186/1742-4682-11-44.,,,,PMC4213466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparisons were made between VEGF and the other risk factors used in evaluating CNS metastasis. Although not in strict accordance, VEGF levels mirrored the disease course.

The basic therapy for patients with AML has changed little over the past 30 years. Improvements in outcome in recent decades in younger adult cohorts have generally been ascribed to better supportive care (ie, transfusion and antimicrobial therapy); older adults with AML continue to fare poorly. The explosion of new knowledge regarding the AML genome has yet to be translated into therapeutic benefit, but analysis of specific molecular features in AML samples has enabled the field to more accurately parse out prognosis and assign appropriate therapies (eg, chemotherapy vs allogeneic stem cell transplantation) for groups of patients. Cytogenetic analysis, whether by metaphase or interphase analysis, has been the main tool used to divide patients into varying prognostic subsets, but it has been modified in recent years to include assessment of mutations in a small number of genes. In the past several years, new technologies have provided strategies to interrogate individual cancer genomes in a broad and in-depth fashion. The present article discusses the potential of these new technologies, particularly gene panel and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic outcome in AML.","['Graubert, Timothy', 'Stone, Richard']","['Graubert T', 'Stone R']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA.

Genomic profiling has given rise to fundamental observations about the biology of AML and has served to better define clinical outcomes for patients based on somatic mutational status. As additional mutations are identified with a known or postulated role in AML pathogenesis, the challenge ahead will be learning how to integrate these findings into clinical practice in such a way that they have a meaningful impact on patient care and, ultimately, on patient outcomes. Potential goals include using genomic information for refined risk stratification and clinical decision making, and to identify genetic lesions that guide the use of molecularly targeted therapies. The development of next-generation sequencing technologies has made genomic profiling a viable option for use in clinical practice because it can provide robust, high-coverage sequencing data for multiple genes in 1 assay, within a clinically reasonable time frame. The present article discusses recent candidate gene sequencing studies, the development of prognostic models based on these studies, and the current and potential future uses of next-generation sequencing technologies in making treatment decisions for patients with AML.","['Sanchez, Matias', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Rampal, Raajit']","['Sanchez M', 'Levine RL', 'Rampal R']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.

According to a review of the current literature, the balanced translocations (t[15;17], t[8;21], and inv[16]) and nucleotide variants in DNMT3A and TET2 most commonly occur in the founding clone at diagnosis. These mutations are rarely gained or lost at relapse, and the latter 2 mutations are observed in elderly subjects with mosaic hematopoiesis antedating overt leukemia.
