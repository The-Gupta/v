Epub 2015 Sep 15.,"Oncogenic transformation is believed to impact the vascular phenotype and microenvironment in cancer, at least in part, through mechanisms involving extracellular vesicles (EVs). We explored these questions in the context of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4) expressing oncogenic fusion protein, PML-RARa and exquisitely sensitive to its clinically used antagonist, the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We report that NB4 cells produce considerable numbers of EVs, which are readily taken up by cultured endothelial cells triggering their increased survival. NB4 EVs contain PML-RARa transcript, but no detectable protein, which is also absent in endothelial cells upon the vesicle uptake, thereby precluding an active intercellular trafficking of this oncogene in this setting. ATRA treatment changes the emission profile of NB4-related EVs resulting in preponderance of smaller vesicles, an effect that occurs in parallel with the onset of cellular differentiation. ATRA also increases IL-8 mRNA and protein content in NB4 cells and their EVs, while decreasing the levels of VEGF and tissue factor (TF). Endothelial cell uptake of NB4-derived EVs renders these cells more TF-positive and procoagulant, and this effect is diminished by pre-treatment of EV donor cells with ATRA. Profiling angiogenesis-related transcripts in intact and ATRA-treated APL cells and their EVs reveals multiple differences attributable to cellular responses and EV molecular packaging. These observations point to the potential significance of changes in the angiogenic signature and activity associated with EVs released from tumor cells subjected to targeted therapy.","['MOP 111119/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP 133424/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']","['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been found to be at risk of becoming overweight or obese early in treatment, with increases in weight maintained throughout treatment and beyond. Nutrition plays an important role in the etiology of obesity and cardiometabolic conditions and is among the few modifiable factors that can prevent or delay the early onset of these chronic conditions. However, nutritional intake in childhood cancer survivors has not been adequately examined and the evidence is built on data from small cohorts of survivors. In addition, the long-term impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment on survivors' nutritional intake as well as how survivors' nutritional intake is associated with chronic health conditions have not been well quantified in large-scale studies. Promoting family-based healthy lifestyles, preferably at a sensitive window of unhealthy weight gain, is a priority for preventing the early onset of obesity and cardiometabolic conditions in childhood cancer survivors.","['P30 DK046200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025752/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000073/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30DK46200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,['(c) 2015 American Society for Nutrition.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 16.,"A novel optical biosensor based on long-range surface plasmon-polariton (LRSPP) waveguides is demonstrated for the detection of leukemia markers in patient serum using a functionalization strategy based on Protein G. The sensor consists of thin straight Au waveguides (5 mum x 35 nm x 3.2 mm) embedded in fluoropolymer CYTOP with a fluidic channel etched into the top cladding. B-cell leukemia is characterized by a high B-cell count and abnormal distribution of immunoglobulin G kappa (IgGkappa) and lambda (IgGlambda) light chains in serum. The detection of leukemic abnormalities in serum was performed based on determining IgGkappa-to-IgGlambda ratios (kappa : lambda). Three patient sera were tested: high kappa (HKS, kappa : lambda ~12.7 : 1), high lambda (HLS, lambda : kappa ~6.9 : 1) and normal (control) sera (NS, kappa : lambda ~1.7 : 1). Au waveguides were functionalized with Protein G and two complementary immobilization approaches were investigated: a) the reverse approach, where the Protein G surface is functionalized with patient serum and then tested against goat anti-human IgG light chains in buffer, and b) the direct approach, where the Protein G surface is functionalized with goat anti-human IgGs first and then tested against patient serum. The reverse approach was found to be more effective and robust because Protein G-functionalized surface performs as an ""immunological filter"" by capturing primarily IgGs out of the pool of serum proteins. For the reverse approach, the ratios measured were 3.7 : 1(kappa : lambda), 9.7 : 1(lambda : kappa) and 1.9 : 1(kappa : lambda) for HKS, HLS and NS, respectively, which compare favorably with corresponding protein densitometry measurements. The respective ratios for the direct approach were 2.6 : 1(kappa : lambda), 2.6 : 1(lambda : kappa) and 1.7 : 1(kappa : lambda). The binding strength and cross-reactivity of goat anti-human IgGs light chains were also determined using pure solutions. The LRSPP biosensor along with the innovative ""reverse approach"" can provide a low-cost and compact solution to B-cell leukemia screening.",,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IgG Fc-binding protein, Streptococcus)', '0 (Immobilized Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 15.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of hematological malignancy that is characterized by the generation of Philadelphia chromosome encoding BCR/ABL oncoprotein. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, are used for the frontline therapy of CML. Development of resistance against these TKIs in the patients bearing T315I mutation is a major obstacle in CML therapy. Ponatinib, the third-generation TKI, is novel drug that is effective even in CML patients with T315I mutation. The exact mechanism of ponatinib in CML has been still unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the potential mechanisms and structural metabolic changes activated by ponatinib treatment in imatinib-sensitive K562 human CML cell lines and 3 muM-imatinib-resistant K562/IMA3 CML cell lines generated at our lab. Apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of ponatinib on imatinib-sensitive and 3 muM-imatinib-resistant K562/IMA3 CML cells were determined by proliferation and apoptosis assays. Additionally, the effects of ponatinib on macromolecules and lipid profiles were also analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Our results revealed that ponatinib inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis as determined by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased caspase-3 enzyme activity, and transfer of phosphatidylserine to the plasma membrane in both K562 and K562/IMA-3 cells. Furthermore, cell cycle analyses revealed that ponatinib arrested K562 and K562/IMA-3 cells at G1 phase. Moreover, ponatinib treatment created a more ordered nucleic acid structure in the resistant cells. Although the lipid to protein ratio increased in imatinib-sensitive K562 cells with a little decrease in the K562/IMA-3 cells, ponatinib treatment indicated significant changes in the lipid composition such as a significant increase in the cellular cholesterol amounts much more in the K562/IMA-3 cells than the sensitive counterparts. Unsaturation in lipids was higher in the resistant cells; however, increases in lipids without phosphate and the number of acyl chains were much higher in the K562 cells. Taken together, all these results showed powerful antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of ponatinib in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells in a dose-dependent manner, and hence, the use of ponatinib for the treatment of TKI-resistant CML patients may be an effective treatment approach in the clinic. More importantly, these results showed that FTIR spectroscopy can detect drug-induced physiological changes in cancer drug resistance.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence rates of composite of major arterial events were 0.8 per 100 patient-years for non-TKI treatments, 1.1 per 100 patient-years for dasatinib, 0.1 per 100 patient-years for imatinib, 0.4 per 100 patient-years for bosutinib, 2.8 per 100 patient-years for nilotinib and 10.6 per 100 patient-years for ponatinib. The relative risk (RR) for nilotinib compared with imatinib suggests a significantly increased risk of the composite of major arterial events with nilotinib treatment (RR 5.3; 95%CI 3.0-9.3, p < 0.001).

Epub 2015 Sep 16.,"As relapses are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), early relapse prediction is of high importance. Although conventional minimal residual disease (MRD) measurement is carried out in bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB) would be an advantageous alternative source. This study aims to investigate the specificity of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes used for MRD detection in blood samples. Consistency of PB MRD as compared with BM MRD was determined in flow cytometric data of 205 paired BM and PB samples of 114 AML patients. A significant correlation was found between PB and BM MRD (r=0.67, P<0.001), while median PB MRD percentage was factor 4-5 lower compared with BM MRD. Primitive blast (CD34+/CD117+/CD133+) frequency was significantly lower in PB (median factor 23.7), indicating that PB MRD detection is more specific than BM. Cumulative incidence of relapse 1 year after induction therapy was 29% for PB MRD-negative and 89% for PB MRD-positive patients (P<0.001). Three-year OS was 52% for MRD-negative and 15% for MRD-positive patients (P=0.034). Similar differences were found after consolidation therapy. As PB MRD appeared to be an independent predictor for response duration, the highly specific PB MRD assay may have a prominent role in future MRD assessment in AML.",,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Oct 13.,"Decitabine (DAC) is commonly used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous studies have indicated DAC sequentially combined with idarubicin was an effective treatment for myeloid neoplasms. Therefore, a clinical study was conducted of the sequential combination of DAC followed by low-dose idarubicin/cytarabine in high-risk myeloid neoplasms. A total of 30 patients with a diagnosis of high-risk MDS, AML evolving from MDS or relapsed/refractory AML were enrolled in the study. DAC was administered 20 mg/m(2) daily for 3 consecutive days. Idarubicin (3 mg/m(2)/day) was administered 24 h after the last administration of DAC for 5-7 consecutive days, combined with cytarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day) for 7-14 days. The overall complete remission rate was 66.67%. The results demonstrate that epigenetic priming with decitabine followed by low-dose idarubicin/ytarabine has an increased anti-leukemia effect compared to traditional chemotherapy in high-risk myeloid neoplasms.",,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,['ChiCTR/CHICTR-OPC-15005771'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 15.,"INTRODUCTION: The Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib was approved in 2001 for chronic myeloid leukemia therapy, and dramatically changed the lives of patients affected by this disease. Since it also inhibits platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-Kit, imatinib is used for various other tumors caused by abnormalities of one or both these two enzymes. AREAS COVERED: This review presents an overview on imatinib formulations and derivatives, synthetic methodologies and therapeutic uses that have appeared in the patent literature since 2008. EXPERT OPINION: Innovative imatinib formulations, such as nanoparticles containing the drug, will improve its bioavailability. Moreover, oral solutions or high imatinib content tablets or capsules will improve patient compliance. Some solid formulations and innovative syntheses that have appeared in the last few years will reduce the cost of the drug, offering big advantages for poor countries. Some recently patented efficacious imatinib derivatives are in preclinical studies and could enter clinical trials in the next few years. Overall, Bcr-Abl inhibitors constitute a very appealing research field that can be expected to expand further.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 11.,"Recent studies have demonstrated the protective effect of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation against relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adult myeloid malignancies. We assessed the association of CMV reactivation, defined as the development of CMV antigenemia (at least 1 pp65 antigen-positive cell per 5.0 x 10(4) WBCs) within 100 days after HSCT, with the risk of relapse in 143 patients with pediatric acute leukemia. The median age at HSCT was 7 years, and underlying diseases included acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 101 patients and acute myeloid leukemia in 42. The cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation at day 100 after HSCT was 45.4%. At a median follow-up of 88 months, patients with CMV reactivation had significantly lower 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse compared with patients without CMV reactivation. In a multivariate analysis, high-level CMV reactivation (>/=10 pp65 antigen-positive cells) was an independent factor associated with reduced relapse. However, CMV reactivation was also associated with higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM), mostly caused by opportunistic infection after grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which resulted in decreased probability of survival. High-level CMV reactivation was a risk factor for increased NRM and worse overall survival in multivariate analysis. Although CMV reactivation may reduce the risk of relapse after HSCT for pediatric acute leukemia, effective management of severe acute GVHD and better prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic infections are required to reduce the incidence of NRM and improve survival. Further studies on pediatric HSCT that include a larger number of patients and more homogenous patient cohorts are desirable.",,,,"['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The risk of transplant from Bx1 donors and the benefit of the presence of Cen-B (regardless of number) were observed for standard-risk acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) patients in this 4-year retrospective study. A total of 210 Chinese patients who underwent unrelated donor HSCT were investigated. Donor KIR profile Bx was associated with significantly improved overall survival (OS; P = .026) and relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .021) and reduced nonrelapse mortality (NRM; P = .017) in AML/MDS patients. A significantly lower survival rate was observed for transplants from Bx1 donors compared with Bx2, Bx3, and Bx4 donors for patients in first complete remission (n = 82; OS: P = .024; RFS: P = .021). Transplant from donors with Cen-B resulted in improved OS (HR = .256; 95% CI, .084 to .774; P = .016) and RFS (HR = .252; 95% CI, .084 to .758; P = .014) in AML/MDS patients at standard risk. However, this particular effect did not increase with a higher number of Cen-B motifs (cB/B versus cA/B; OS: P = .755; RFS: P = .768). No effect was observed on high-risk AML/MDS, acute lymphoblastic leukemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Avoiding the selection of HSCT donors of KIR profile Bx1 is strongly advisable for standard-risk AML/MDS patients. The presence of the Cen-B motif rather than its number was more important in donor selection for the Chinese population.",,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],,"['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Sep 11.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are chronic marrow disorders with variable prognoses. Most patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or even primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are successfully treated with conservative strategies for years or even decades, and recent data suggest that even in patients with high-risk disease, in particular those with PMF, life expectancy can be extended by treatment with janus kinase (JAK2) inhibitors. However, none of those modalities are curative, and after marrow failure develops, the disease ""accelerates,"" or transforms to acute leukemia, the only option able to effectively treat and, in fact, cure MPN is allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Outcome is superior if HCT is performed before leukemic transformation occurs. Several reports document survival in unmaintained remission beyond 10 years. The most recent analyses show reduced regimen-related mortality (less than 10% or even 5% at day 100) and progressively improved survival with both HLA-identical sibling and unrelated donors. The development of low/reduced-intensity conditioning regimens has contributed to the improved success rate and has allowed successful HCT in patients in their seventh and even eighth decade of life. We propose, therefore, that HCT should be offered to fit patients in these age groups and should be covered by their respective insurance carriers.","['R01 CA087948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"CONTEXT: There is an increasing concern about chronic low-level pesticide exposure during childhood and its influence on childhood cancers. OBJECTIVE: In this meta-analysis, we aimed to examine associations between residential childhood pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. DATA SOURCES: We searched all observational studies published in PubMed before February 2014 and reviewed reference sections of articles derived from searches. STUDY SELECTION: The literature search yielded 277 studies that met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. We calculated effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using a random effect model with inverse variance weights. RESULTS: We found that childhood exposure to indoor but not outdoor residential insecticides was associated with a significant increase in risk of childhood leukemia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.72; I(2) = 30%) and childhood lymphomas (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15-1.78; I(2) = 0%). A significant increase in risk of leukemia was also associated with herbicide exposure (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44; I(2) = 0%). Also observed was a positive but not statistically significant association between childhood home pesticide or herbicide exposure and childhood brain tumors. LIMITATIONS: The small number of studies included in the analysis represents a major limitation of the current analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this meta-analysis indicated that children exposed to indoor insecticides would have a higher risk of childhood hematopoietic cancers. Additional research is needed to confirm the association between residential indoor pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. Meanwhile, preventive measures should be considered to reduce children's exposure to pesticides at home.",,['0 (Pesticides)'],,['Copyright (c) 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"MicroRNAs have emerged as key regulators of B cell fate decisions and immune function. Deregulation of several microRNAs in B cells leads to the development of autoimmune disease and cancer in mice. We demonstrate that the microRNA-212/132 cluster (miR-212/132) is induced in B cells in response to B cell receptor signaling. Enforced expression of miR-132 results in a block in early B cell development at the prepro-B cell to pro-B cell transition and induces apoptosis in primary bone marrow B cells. Importantly, loss of miR-212/132 results in accelerated B cell recovery after antibody-mediated B cell depletion. We find that Sox4 is a target of miR-132 in B cells. Co-expression of SOX4 with miR-132 rescues the defect in B cell development from overexpression of miR-132 alone, thus suggesting that miR-132 may regulate B lymphopoiesis through Sox4. In addition, we show that the expression of miR-132 can inhibit cancer development in cells that are prone to B cell cancers, such as B cells expressing the c-Myc oncogene. We have thus uncovered miR-132 as a novel contributor to B cell development.","['CA183220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008042/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI079243/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI079243/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 HL110691/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL110691/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA183220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN132 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MIRN212 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox4 protein, mouse)']",,['(c) 2015 Mehta et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"For most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have turned a fatal disease into a manageable chronic condition. Imatinib, the first BCR-ABL1 TKI granted regulatory approval, has been surpassed in terms of molecular responses by the second-generation TKIs nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. Recently, ponatinib was approved as the only TKI with activity against the T315I mutation. Although all TKIs are associated with nonhematologic adverse events (AEs), experience with imatinib suggested that toxicities are typically manageable and apparent early during drug development. Recent reports of cardiovascular AEs with nilotinib and particularly ponatinib and of pulmonary arterial hypertension with dasatinib have raised concerns about long-term sequelae of drugs that may be administered for decades. Here, we review what is currently known about the cardiovascular toxicities of BCR-ABL1 TKIs, discuss potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular AEs, and elucidate discrepancies between the reporting of such AEs between oncology and cardiovascular trials. Whenever possible, we provide practical recommendations, but we concede that cause-directed interventions will require better mechanistic understanding.

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is a fungal pathogen in the phylum Chytridiomycota that causes the skin disease chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is considered an emerging infectious disease linked to worldwide amphibian declines and extinctions. Although amphibians have well-developed immune defenses, clearance of this pathogen from the skin is often impaired. Previously, we showed that the adaptive immune system is involved in the control of the pathogen, but B. dendrobatidis releases factors that inhibit in vitro and in vivo lymphocyte responses and induce lymphocyte apoptosis. Little is known about the nature of the inhibitory factors released by this fungus. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of three fungal metabolites produced by B. dendrobatidis but not by the closely related nonpathogenic chytrid Homolaphlyctis polyrhiza. These metabolites are methylthioadenosine (MTA), tryptophan, and an oxidized product of tryptophan, kynurenine (Kyn). Independently, both MTA and Kyn inhibit the survival and proliferation of amphibian lymphocytes and the Jurkat human T cell leukemia cell line. However, working together, they become effective at much lower concentrations. We hypothesize that B. dendrobatidis can adapt its metabolism to release products that alter the local environment in the skin to inhibit immunity and enhance the survival of the pathogen.",,"['0 (Thionucleosides)', '343-65-7 (Kynurenine)', '4105-39-9 (2-methylthioadenosine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cadmium at low environmental (nanomolar) concentrations on apoptotic processes in THP-1(acute monocytic leukemia cells line)-derived macrophages, with special focus on mitochondrial events involved. Macrophages were incubated with various cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) solutions for 48 h at final concentrations of 5 nM, 20 nM, 200 nM and 2 microM CdCl(2). Cell viability was measured using flow cytometry. Flow cytometric measurement (annexin V/FITC (annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate) and PI (propidium iodide) double staining) was used to quantify the extent of apoptosis. Fluorescence and confocal microscopy were used for imaging of apoptosis process. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were monitored using cytofluorimetry after cell staining with JC-1(5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyane iodide) probe. Mitochondrial ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels were measured cytofluorimetrically after incubation of cells with mitochondrial superoxide indicator (MitoSOX) red fluorescent marker. The mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was analysed with qRT-PCR. Our study demonstrates that cadmium, even at low environmental concentrations, exerts mitochondrial toxicity in THP-1 macrophages. Forty-eight-hour exposure to very low concentrations reduces cell viability and results in cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS production, increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 mRNA expression are mitochondrial events involved in cadmium-induced apoptosis.",,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We identified patients treated for ALL at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, seen in the After Completion of Therapy (ACT) Clinic between January of 2006 and January of 2014 who had QCT-derived BMD and panoramic radiographs obtained within 1 month of each other. Panoramic radiographs were independently scored by a pediatric radiologist, two pediatric dentists, and a general dentist using the Klemetti technique. We used the Spearman's rank correlation test and the multivariate regression model to investigate the effect of evaluator experience on results. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 181 patients with 320 paired studies: 112 (62%) male, 112 (71%) were white. Median age at ALL diagnosis was 6.4 (range, 0-18.8) years. Median age at study was 11.9 (range, 3.3 to 29.4) years. The median average BMD was 154.6 (range, 0.73-256) mg/cc; median QCT Z-score (age and gender adjusted) was -0.875 (range, -5.04 to 3.2). We found very weak association between panoramic radiograph score and both QCT-BMD average (P = 0.53) and QCT Z-score (P = 0.39). Results were not influenced by level of reader experience. CONCLUSIONS: The Klemetti technique of estimating BMD does not predict BMD deficits in children and young adult survivors of ALL, regardless of reviewer expertise.

The synergistic action of the two cytokines has been described with regard to apoptotic cell death and inflammatory responses in different cell types, but little is known regarding the human endometrium. Therefore, we examined the interaction of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). ESCs were isolated from specimens obtained during hysterectomy and decidualized in vitro. Cells were incubated with TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma or signaling-inhibitor. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-1, prolactin (PRL), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted protein (RANTES) and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 were measured using ELISA and real-time RT-PCR. Nuclear factor of transcription (NF)-kappaB and its inhibitor (IkappaBalpha) were analyzed by in-cell western assay and transcription factor assay. TNF-alpha inhibited and IFN-gamma did not affect the decidualization of ESCs. In contrast, IFN-gamma differentially modulated the stimulating effect of TNF-alpha on cytokines by enhancing IL-6, RANTES and MCP-1 and attenuating LIF mRNA expression. These effects were time- and dose-dependent. IFN-gamma had no impact on the initial activation of NF-kappaB signaling. Histone-deacetylase activity was involved in the modulating effect of IFN-gamma on RANTES secretion. These observations showed a distinct pattern of interaction of the Th-1 cytokines, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the human endometrium, which could play an important role in the pathophysiology of implantation disorders.",,"['0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (IGFBP1 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal', 'Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.', 'Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

This study aimed to compile national cancer incidences and mortalities in 2011 and estimate cancer incident new cases and cancer deaths. METHODS: In 2014, there were 234 cancer registries that submitted records of new cancer cases and cancer deaths that occurred in 2011 to the NCCR. All datasets were evaluated based on the criteria of data quality of the NCCR. The data of 177 registries was of sufficient quality and was compiled to evaluate cancer statistics in 2011. The pooled data were stratified by area, sex, age group, and cancer type. Cancer incident cases and deaths were estimated using age-standardized rates (ASR) and the Chinese population. All incidences and mortalities were age-standardized to the 2000 Chinese standard population and Segi's population. RESULTS: The estimates of new cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 3,372,175 and 2,113,048 in 2011, respectively. The crude incidence was 250.28/1,00,000 (277.77/1,00,000 for males and 221.37/1,00,000 for females). The ASRs of incidence by the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) and by the world standard population (ASRIW) were 186.34/1,00,000 and 182.76/1,00,000, respectively, with a cumulative incidence (0-74 years old) of 21.20%. Cancers of the lung, female breast, stomach, liver, colorectum, esophagus, cervix, uterus, prostate, and ovary were the most common cancers, accounting for approximately 75% of all new cancer cases. Lung, liver, gastric, esophageal, colorectal, female breast, pancreatic, brain, and cervical cancers and leukemia were the leading causes of cancer death, accounting for approximately 80% of all cancer deaths. Cancer incidence, mortality, and spectrum were all different between urban and rural areas and between males and females. CONCLUSIONS: The population covered by the cancer registries greatly increased from 2010 to 2011. The data quality and representativeness of cancer registries have gradually improved. Cancer registries have an irreplaceable role in research on cancer prevention and control.

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"Siglec-1 (sialoadhesin, CD169) is a surface receptor on human cells that mediates trans-enhancement of HIV-1 infection through recognition of sialic acid moieties in virus membrane gangliosides. Here, we demonstrate that mouse Siglec-1, expressed on the surface of primary macrophages in an interferon-alpha-responsive manner, captures murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles and mediates their transfer to proliferating lymphocytes. The MLV infection of primary B-cells was markedly more efficient than that of primary T-cells. The major structural protein of MLV particles, Gag, frequently co-localized with Siglec-1, and trans-infection, primarily of surface-bound MLV particles, efficiently occurred. To explore the role of sialic acid for MLV trans-infection at a submolecular level, we analyzed the potential of six sialic acid precursor analogs to modulate the sialylated ganglioside-dependent interaction of MLV particles with Siglec-1. Biosynthetically engineered sialic acids were detected in both the glycolipid and glycoprotein fractions of MLV producer cells. MLV released from cells carrying N-acyl-modified sialic acids displayed strikingly different capacities for Siglec-1-mediated capture and trans-infection; N-butanoyl, N-isobutanoyl, N-glycolyl, or N-pentanoyl side chain modifications resulted in up to 92 and 80% reduction of virus particle capture and trans-infection, respectively, whereas N-propanoyl or N-cyclopropylcarbamyl side chains had no effect. In agreement with these functional analyses, molecular modeling indicated reduced binding affinities for non-functional N-acyl modifications. Thus, Siglec-1 is a key receptor for macrophage/lymphocyte trans-infection of surface-bound virions, and the N-acyl side chain of sialic acid is a critical determinant for the Siglec-1/MLV interaction.","['P01 HL107151/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 GM103490/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL107151/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41GM10349010/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1)', '0 (Siglec1 protein, mouse)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",,"['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,['PDB/1OD7'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had undergone allogeneic BMT for acute myelocytic leukemia and received both prednisolone (2 mg/day) and cyclosporine (30 mg/day). Chest CT demonstrated no abnormal findings on admission; however, multiple pulmonary nodules and the ""halo sign"" were detected three weeks later. Although a fungal infection was initially suspected, a bronchoscopic examination revealed pulmonary MAC infection.

In all reported trials, patients have received T-cell products comprising random compositions of CD4(+) and CD8(+) naive and memory T cells, meaning that each patient received a different therapeutic agent. This variation may have influenced the efficacy of T-cell therapy, and complicates comparison of outcomes between different patients and across trials. We analyzed CD19 CAR-expressing effector T cells derived from different subsets (CD4(+)/CD8(+) naive, central memory, effector memory). T cells derived from each of the subsets were efficiently transduced and expanded, but showed clear differences in effector function and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Combining the most potent CD4(+) and CD8(+) CAR-expressing subsets, resulted in synergistic antitumor effects in vivo. We show that CAR-T-cell products generated from defined T-cell subsets can provide uniform potency compared with products derived from unselected T cells that vary in phenotypic composition. These findings have important implications for the formulation of T-cell products for adoptive therapies.","['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA138293/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,['NIHMS721365'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the newly discovered receptor CXCR7 for CXCL12 is highly expressed in many tumor cells as well as tumor-associated blood vessels, although the level of CXCR7 in normal blood cells is low. Recently, many studies have suggested that CXCR7 promotes cell growth and metastasis in various cancers, including lymphoma and leukemia, hepatocecullar, ovarian, colorectal, breast and lung cancer. Compared to CXCR4, CXCR7 is a non-classical GPCR that is unable to activate G proteins. The function of CXCR7 is generally considered to be mediated by: (a) recruiting beta-arrestin-2; (b) heterodimerizing with CXCR4; and (c) acting as a ""scavenger"" of CXCL12, thus lowering the level of CXCL12 to weaken the activity of CXCR4. However, the crosstalk between CXCL12/CXCR7/CXCR4 and other signaling pathways (such as the p38 MAPK pathway, the PI3K/mTOR pathway, the STAT3 signaling, and metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MMP-2) is more complicated. The function of CXCR7 is also involved in modulating tumor microenvironment, tumor cell migration and apoptosis. Understanding these complex interactions will provide insight in drug design targeting the CXCR7 as potential anticancer therapy.",['CA173056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (ACKR3 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"INTRODUCTION: Among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the DACO-016 randomized study showed reduction in mortality for decitabine [Dacogen((R)) (DAC), Eisai Inc., Woodcliff Lake, NJ, USA] compared with treatment choice (TC): at primary analysis the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.04; stratified log-rank P = 0.108). With two interim analyses, two-sided alpha was adjusted to 0.0462. With 1-year additional follow-up the HR reached 0.82 (nominal P = 0.0373). These data resulted in approval of DAC in the European Union, though not in the United States. Though pre-specified, the log-rank test could be considered not optimal to assess the observed survival difference because of the non-proportional hazard nature of the survival curves. METHODS: We applied the Wilcoxon test as a sensitivity analysis. Patients were randomized to DAC (N = 242) or TC (N = 243). One-hundred and eight (44.4%) patients in the TC arm and 91 (37.6%) patients in the DAC arm selectively crossed over to subsequent disease modifying therapies at progression, which might impact the survival beyond the median with resultant converging curves (and disproportional hazards). RESULTS: The stratified Wilcoxon test showed a significant improvement in median (CI 95%) overall survival with DAC [7.7 (6.2; 9.2) months] versus TC [5.0 (4.3; 6.3) months; P = 0.0458]. CONCLUSION: Wilcoxon test indicated significant increase in survival for DAC versus TC compared to log-rank test.

Chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment for the last several decades. The introduction of biological, targeted agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) has dramatically improved treatment options. The addition of rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide has improved patient outcomes, as compared to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Nevertheless, chronic lymphocytic leukemia remains incurable, leaving considerable room for improvement. One approach would be to enhance the activity of the CD20 antibody. The next-generation monoclonal antibody ofatumumab has not demonstrated superiority over rituximab, whereas obinutuzumab-chlorambucil is superior to rituximab-chlorambucil.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Twenty-one women with RPL and 20 women with proven fertility (controls). INTERVENTION(S): Primary endometrial cells and blood samples during the midsecretory phase (days 19-23). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Detection of IL-12, IL-18, IFN-gamma, ICAM-1, LIF, and MIF via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in both blood and endometrial tissue samples. RESULT(S): The blood and tissue levels of IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-gamma were statistically significantly higher, and the blood and tissue levels of LIF and MIF were statistically significantly lower in patients with RPL. Only the level of tissue ICAM-1 was higher in patients with RPL. There was a strong correlation between blood and tissue level measurements of IL-12, IL-18, LIF, and MIF. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings support the hypothesis that inflammatory processes may contribute to pregnancy loss, possibly through their role in implantation. We found that blood and tissue levels of IL-18, LIF, and MIF, and tissue levels of IL-12, IFN-gamma, and ICAM-1 have statistically significant prognostic relevance.",,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Eight compounds were chosen by National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA to evaluate their in vitro antiproliferative activity at 10(-5)M in full NCI 60 cell panel. The preliminary screening of the tested compounds showed promising broad-spectrum anticancer activity. Compound 4c was further assayed for five dose molar ranges in full NCI 60 cell panel and exhibited remarkable growth inhibitory activity pattern against Leukemia CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4, Lung Cancer HOP-92, Colon Cancer HCC-2998, CNS Cancer SNB-75, Melanoma SK-MEL-2, Ovarian Cancer IGROV1, Renal Cancer 786-0, RXF 393, Breast Cancer HS 578T and T-47D (GI50: 1.00-2.71muM). Moreover, enzyme assays were carried out to investigate the possible antiproliferative mechanism of action of compound 4c. The results revealed that compound 4c has good c-Src inhibitory activity at 10muM. In addition, molecular docking studies showed that 4c could bind to the ATP Src pocket sites. Fulfilling the Lipinskiis rule of five in addition to its ADME profile and the biological results, all strongly suggest that 4c is a promising Src kinase inhibitor.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Pyrazoles)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are being explored as a promising therapeutic avenue in numerous cancers. While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies, mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9;Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistant mouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.","['F 4710/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'K22 CA181280/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '242922/European Research Council/International', 'P30 CA045508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '336860/European Research Council/International']","['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)']",,,,['GEO/GSE63782'],['EMS68846'],,,,['NLM: EMS68846'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"Bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are first-in-class targeted therapies that deliver a new therapeutic opportunity by directly targeting bromodomain proteins that bind acetylated chromatin marks. Early clinical trials have shown promise, especially in acute myeloid leukaemia, and therefore the evaluation of resistance mechanisms is crucial to optimize the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Here we use primary mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells immortalized with the fusion protein MLL-AF9 to generate several single-cell clones that demonstrate resistance, in vitro and in vivo, to the prototypical BET inhibitor, I-BET. Resistance to I-BET confers cross-resistance to chemically distinct BET inhibitors such as JQ1, as well as resistance to genetic knockdown of BET proteins. Resistance is not mediated through increased drug efflux or metabolism, but is shown to emerge from leukaemia stem cells both ex vivo and in vivo. Chromatin-bound BRD4 is globally reduced in resistant cells, whereas the expression of key target genes such as Myc remains unaltered, highlighting the existence of alternative mechanisms to regulate transcription. We demonstrate that resistance to BET inhibitors, in human and mouse leukaemia cells, is in part a consequence of increased Wnt/beta-catenin signalling, and negative regulation of this pathway results in restoration of sensitivity to I-BET in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings provide new insights into the biology of acute myeloid leukaemia, highlight potential therapeutic limitations of BET inhibitors, and identify strategies that may enhance the clinical utility of these unique targeted therapies.","['14-1069/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'MR/M010392/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'K08 CA160647/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '10827/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '5QIO6SRZ2R (molibresib)']",,,,['GEO/GSE63683'],['NIHMS982369'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the impact of nonbiological factors (NBFs) on the survival of patients with AML. METHODS: The impact of NBFs (marital status, insurance status, county-level income, and education) on survival was assessed along with biological factors (disease subtype, sex, age, and race/ethnicity) using a cohort of patients aged 19 to 64 years who were diagnosed with AML between 2007 and 2011 and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program registry (SEER 18). RESULTS: There were 5541 patients included. The median overall survival for the entire study population was 16 months. On multivariate analysis, an increased risk of death was independently linked to being a Medicaid beneficiary, uninsured, single, divorced, and residing in a county within the lower 3 quintiles of median household income. NBFs affected the risk of early (<2 months) and late mortality and their impact was confirmed among patients known to have received chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Insurance status, marital status, and county-level income were found to independently affect the survival of younger patients with AML and should be integrated into outcome comparisons. Interventions are needed to mitigate the impact of social factors on survival among patients with AML.",,,"['Cancer. 2016 Apr 15;122(8):1299-300. PMID: 26882103', 'Cancer. 2016 Apr 15;122(8):1298-9.

Epub 2015 Sep 11.,"New anti-viral agents and strategies are urgently needed to fight rapidly mutating viruses, as vaccine programs cannot react fast enough to prevent pandemics. Recently, we have shown that interleukin-24 (IL-24) sensitizes tumor cells to toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mediated apoptosis. As influenza A virus stimulates the TLR3 receptor, we hypothesized that IL-24 might also exert an anti-viral effect. This study demonstrates that IL-24 reduces the titer of different influenza A virus subtypes independently of type I interferon in an apoptosis dependent manner. The anti-viral effect of IL-24 correlated with caspase-3 activation and could be blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor and by small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed towards TLR3. Surprisingly, caspase-3 activation in influenza A virus/IL-24-stimulated cells correlated with the down-regulation of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family member myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). Correspondingly, knockdown of Mcl-1 by siRNA enhanced caspase activation in influenza A virus infected cells and was furthermore linked to a reduction of viral titers. We conclude that IL-24 exerts an anti-viral role selectively purging virally infected cells by leading to a down-regulation of Mcl-1. Our findings might therefore represent the first step towards a new rational concept in the development of anti-viral strategies based on the induction of apoptosis.",,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 3)', '0 (interleukin-24)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The question of whether outcomes can be improved with an allele-level 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) rather than an older HLA-matched sibling (MSD, more than 55 years) is still unanswered. We thus analyzed outcomes in 714 patients aged 55 years and older with AML in first CR (CR1) who received PBSCs after a reduced-intensity conditioning hematopoietic cell transplant from a MUD (n=310) or a MSD (n=404) in a recent period (2005-2010). The 3-year cumulative incidences (CIs) of non-relapse mortality were 17% and 23% with MSD and MUD, respectively (P=0.17). The 3-year CIs of relapse were 37% and 30%, respectively (P=0.12), resulting in a 3-year CI of leukemia-free survival of 46% and 47%, respectively (P=0.51). The 3-year overall survival was 49% with both MSD and MUD. In conclusion, HLA-identical sibling donors aged 55 years or more should not be excluded because of age for patients aged 55 years and older with AML in CR1.",,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",,,,,,,,,,['Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT'],,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated toxicity and efficacy of a non-TBI-based regimen consisting of treosulfan, etoposide and cyclophosphamide for ALL within a prospective study. Major inclusion criteria were CR and non-eligibility for TBI. Fifty patients with a median age of 46.5 years (range, 18-64) were included. Donors were HLA-identical sibling (n=8), matched (n=42) or mismatched (n=10) unrelated. The toxicity was moderate, resulting in a cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 1 year of 8% (90% confidence interval: 2-15%). Acute GvHD grade II-IV and grade III/IV was noted in 53% and 14%, respectively. Chronic GvHD at one year was seen in 41%. After a median follow-up of 24 months the cumulative incidence of relapse was 36% (90% confidence interval: 24-48) and 51% (90% confidence interval: 37-65) at 1 and 2 years, respectively. The estimated 2-year disease-free and overall survivals were 36 and 48%, respectively.

The main aim of this study was to evaluate Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization in school-aged children and adolescents with cancer to determine the potential protective efficacy of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). An oropharyngeal swab was obtained from 277 patients (age range 6-17 years) with cancer during routine clinical visits and analyzed for S. pneumoniae using real-time polymerase chain reaction. S. pneumoniae was identified in 52 patients (18.8%), including 47/235 (20.0%) with hematologic malignancies and 5/42 (11.9%) with solid tumors. Colonization declined significantly with an increase in age (odds ratio [OR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.71, and OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.82 in children aged 10-14 and >/=15 years, respectively, as compared to those <10 years). Carriage was more common among patients with leukemia or lymphoma than in children with solid tumors. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was significantly associated with reduced pneumococcal carriage (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.89). A total of 15/58 (25.9%) and 26/216 (12.0%) children were colonized by PCV13 serotypes among cancer patients previously vaccinated and not vaccinated with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), respectively. In conclusion, this study indicates that children and adolescents with cancer are frequently colonized by S. pneumoniae.

Epub 2015 Sep 28.,"This study shows that a mitochondria-penetrating nitroxide probe (mito-TEMPO) allows detection of superoxide and visualization of mitochondrial dysfunction in living cells due to the effect of T1 shortening in MRI. Mitochondrial dysfunction was induced by treatment of cells with rotenone and 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME/Rot). The MRI measurements were performed on 7T MRI. The 2-ME/Rot-treated cells were characterized by overproduction of superoxide, which was confirmed by a conventional dihydroethidium test. In the presence of mito-TEMPO, the intensity of MRI signal in 2-ME/Rot-treated cells was approximately 30-40% higher, in comparison with that in untreated cells or culture media. In model (cell-free) systems, we observed that superoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide, increased the intensity of T1-weighted MRI signal of mito-TEMPO. Moreover, the superoxide restores the T1-weighted MRI contrast of mito-TEMPOH, a noncontrast (diamagnetic) analogue of mito-TEMPO. This was also confirmed by using EPR spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that superoxide radical is involved in the enhancement of T1-weighted MRI contrast in living cells, in the absence and presence of mito-TEMPO. This report gives a direction for discovering new opportunities for functional MRI, for detection of metabolic activity, accompanied by overproduction of superoxide, as well as by disturbance of the balance between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, a very important approach to clarify the fine molecular mechanisms in the regulation of many pathologies. The visualization of mitochondrial activity in real-time can be crucial to clarify the molecular mechanism of the functional MRI in its commonly accepted definition, as a method for detection of neurovascular coupling.",,"['0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6I2QW73SR5 (2-Methoxyestradiol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as cytarabine, a mainstay of AML chemotherapy, can trigger adaptive response by influencing leukemic cell transcriptome and, hence, development of resistance or refractory disease. It is, however, challenging to perform such a study due to lack of availability of specimens post-drug treatment.

Whether the higher cost of posaconazole is offset by decreases in IFDs in a given institute requires cost-effective analysis encompassing the spectrum of IFDs and socioeconomic factors specific to that geographic area. METHODS: This study performed a cost-effective analysis of posaconazole prophylaxis for IFDs in an Asian teaching hospital, employing decision modeling and data of IFDs and medication costs specific to the institute, in neutropenic patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). RESULTS: In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the higher cost of posaconazole was partially offset by a reduction in the cost of treating IFDs that were prevented, resulting in an incremental cost of 125,954 Hong Kong dollars/16,148 USD per IFD avoided. Over a lifetime horizon, assuming same case fatality rate of IFDs in both groups, use of posaconazole results in 0.07 discounted life years saved. This corresponds to an incremental cost of 116,023 HKD/14,875 USD per life year saved. This incremental cost per life year saved in posaconazole prophylaxis fulfilled the World Health Organization defined threshold for cost-effectiveness.

This report investigates the prevalence of autoantibodies in children with autism using the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) immunoassay technology. A panel of autoantibody targets against several known and candidate neurological autoantigens, autoimmune-associated autoantigens and viruses was employed. METHODS: Serological analysis was performed on typically developing children (n = 55), developmentally delayed children without autism (n = 24) and children diagnosed with autism (n=104). Autoantibodies were measured against glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65), a CNS autoantigen proposed to be associated with autism and against Ro52, glial fibrillary acidic protein, tyrosine hydroxylase, aquaporin-4, and gamma-enolase, the mouse mammary tumor virus and the xenotropic murine leukemia virus. Antibody levels and seropositivity prevalence were analyzed for statistically significant differences between the three groups. RESULTS: The majority of the children (98%) were seronegative for all targets in the antigen panel. No GAD65 seropositive children were detected in the cohort. Several low level seropositive sera against several of the protein targets were identified in isolated children in each of the three groups, but there was no difference in prevalence. CONCLUSION: Using this panel of antigens and a sensitive, robust assay, no evidence of unusual immunoreactivity was detected in children with autism, providing evidence against a role of autoimmunity against several previously implicated proteins in autism spectrum disorder pathogenesis. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The idea that autoantibodies represent an underlying cause or are biomarkers for autism pathophysiology is not supported by this report.","['Z01 DE000724-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 MH002868-02/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NIHMS719160'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic drugs such as the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine reactivate genes and are effective in myeloid leukemia, but resistance often develops and efficacy in solid tumors is limited. To improve their clinical efficacy, we searched among approved anti-cancer drugs for an epigenetic synergistic combination with decitabine. RESULTS: We used the YB5 cell line, a clonal derivative of the SW48 colon cancer cell line that contains a single copy of a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) to screen for drug-induced gene reactivation and synergy with decitabine. None of the 16 anti-cancer drugs tested had effects on their own. However, in combination with decitabine, platinum compounds showed striking synergy in activating GFP. This was dose dependent, observed both in concurrent and sequential combinations, and also seen with other alkylating agents. Clinically achievable concentrations of carboplatin at (25 muM) and decitabine reactivated GFP in 28 % of the YB5 cells as compared to 15 % with decitabine alone. Epigenetic synergy was also seen at endogenously hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes such as MLH1 and PDLIM4. Genome-wide studies showed that reactivation of hypermethylated genes by the combination was significantly better than that induced by decitabine alone or carboplatin alone. Platinum compounds did not enhance decitabine-induced hypomethylation. Rather, we found significantly inhibited HP1alpha expression by carboplatin and the combination. This was accompanied by increased histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation at reactivated genes (P < 0.0001) and reduced occupancy by methyl-binding proteins including MeCP2 and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the combination of decitabine with platinum analogs shows epigenetic synergy that might be exploited in the treatment of different cancers.","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA158112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"The HLA-E locus encodes a nonclassical class Ib molecule that serves many immune functions from inhibiting NK cells to activating CTLs. Structural analysis of HLA-E/NKG2A complexes visualized fine-tuning of protective immune responses through AA interactions between HLA-E, the bound peptide, and NKG2A/CD94. A loss of cellular protection through abrogation of the HLA-E/NKG2A engagement is dependent on the HLA-E bound peptide. The role of HLA-E in posttransplant outcomes is not well understood but might be attributed to its peptide repertoire. To investigate the self-peptide repertoire of HLA-E ( *) 01:01 in the absence of protective HLA class I signal peptides, we utilized soluble HLA technology in class I negative LCL cells in order to characterize HLA-E ( *) 01:01-bound ligands by mass-spectrometry. To understand the immunological impact of these analyzed ligands on NK cell reactivity, we performed cellular assays. Synthesized peptides were loaded onto recombinant T2 cells expressing HLA-E ( *) 01:01 molecules and applied in cytotoxicity assays using the leukemia derived NK cell line (NKL) as effector. HLA-E in complex with the self-peptides demonstrated a shift towards cytotoxicity and a loss of cell protection. Our data highlights the fact that the HLA-E-peptidome is not as restricted as previously thought and support the suggestion of a posttransplant role for HLA-E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the disease often takes an indolent course, the majority of patients will eventually require therapy. Standard treatment for medically fit patients includes purine analogs and/or alkylating agents in addition to the type I anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab. This therapy is inherently myelosuppressive and can result in significant morbidity and even mortality in patients with impaired performance status due to age and/or medical comorbidities. Historically, treatment options for the elderly or frail patient population were limited to mono-therapy with the oral alkylating agent, chlorambucil, rituximab, or another type I anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ofatumumab. Recently, a newer-generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab, was developed for patients with CLL. Obinutuzumab is a humanized type II monoclonal antibody that appears to have more direct antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and possibly more direct cytotoxicity in vitro than previously available type I antibodies. A large Phase III prospective randomized clinical trial for older patients with impaired renal function and/or significant medical comorbidities demonstrated that when compared to conventionally-dosed rituximab and chlorambucil, the combination of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab administered at a dose and schedule involving early loading doses improved response rates and progression-free survival without significantly increasing toxicity. Results of this pivotal trial led to the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) approval of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil for frontline treatment of CLL. Obinutuzumab expands the armamentarium of active and less-toxic targeted agents in the evolving treatment landscape of CLL, providing physicians and patients with an additional therapeutic option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis is based on morphological criteria of granulocytic cells and the exclusion of genetic drivers that are known to occur in others MPNs, such as BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA/B, or FGFR1 rearrangements. However, this scenario changed with the identification of oncogenic mutations in the CSF3R gene in approximately 83% of WHO-defined and no monoclonal gammopathy-associated CNL patients. CSF3R T618I is a highly specific molecular marker for CNL that is sensitive to inhibition in vitro and in vivo by currently approved protein kinase inhibitors. In addition to CSF3R mutations, other genetic alterations have been found, notably mutations in SETBP1, which may be used as prognostic markers to guide therapeutic decisions. These findings will help to understand the pathogenesis of CNL and greatly impact the clinical management of this disease. In this review, we discuss the new genetic alterations recently found in CNL and the clinical perspectives in its diagnosis and treatment.

However, which ALDH1's isoenzymes are contributing to ALDH1 activity remains elusive. In addition, the prognostic value of individual ALDH1 isoenzyme is not clear. In the current study, we investigated the prognostic value of ALDH1 isoenzymes in NSCLC patients through the Kaplan-Meier plotter database, which contains updated gene expression data and survival information from a total of 1,926 NSCLC patients. High expression of ALDH1A1 mRNA was found to be correlated to a better overall survival (OS) in all NSCLC patients followed for 20 years (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88 [0.77-0.99], P=0.039). In addition, high expression of ALDH1A1 mRNA was also found to be correlated to better OS in adenocarcinoma (Ade) patients (HR 0.71 [0.57-0.9], P=0.0044) but not in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients (HR 0.92 [0.72-1.16], P=0.48). High expression of ALDH1A2 and ALDH1B1 mRNA was found to be correlated to worser OS in all NSCLC patients, as well as in Ade, but not in SCC patients. High expression of both ALDH1A3 and ALDH1L1 mRNA was not found to be correlated to OS in all NSCLC patients. These results strongly support that ALDH1A1 mRNA in NSCLC is associated with better prognosis. In addition, our current study also supports that ALDH1A2 and ALDH1B1 might be major contributors to the ALDH1 activity in NSCLC, since high expression of ALDH1A2 and ALDH1B1 mRNA was found to be significantly correlated to worser OS in all NSCLC patients.

The presumed molecular basis of this resistance is the effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and other cytokines on endothelial adhesion molecule expression. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules correlate in AML. METHODS: Baseline serum levels of 17 cytokines and 5 soluble adhesion molecules were measured in 53 AML patients using biochip array technology. Age, leukocyte count, secondary AML, CRP, FLT3-ITD and remission were variables. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.1.2. RESULTS: VCAM-1 correlated with ICAM-1 (P < 0.0001), E-selectin (P < 0.0001), leukocyte count (P = 0.0005) and TNF-alpha (P = 0.0035). E-selectin correlated with leukocyte count (P < 0.0001), P-selectin (P = 0.0032) and MCP-1 (P = 0.0119). CRP correlated with IL-6 (P < 0.0001), leukocyte count negatively correlated with IL-7 (P = 0.0318). FLT3-ITD was associated with higher E-selectin (P = 0.0010) and lower IL-7 (P = 0.0252). Secondary AML patients were older. Failure of induction therapy was associated with significantly higher CRP and lower P-selectin. Leukocyte count (P < 0.0001), FLT3-ITD (P = 0.0017) and secondary AML (P = 0.0439) influenced the principal component. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemic cells can modulate the microenvironment.

Epub 2015 Sep 11.,"BACKGROUND: An increased risk of adult myeloid leukemia (AML) has recently been associated with lifestyle and environmental exposures, including obesity, smoking, some over the counter medications, and rural/farm habitats in case control studies. The association of these exposures with AML cytogenetic categories, outcomes after therapy, and overall survival is unknown. METHODS: Relevant exposures were evaluated in a cohort of 295 consecutive AML patients diagnosed and treated at Mayo Clinic in Florida and Arizona. Standard cytogenetic risk categories were applied and reviewed in a central cytogenetic laboratory. The association of epidemiologic exposures with cytogenetic risk, complete remission after therapy, and overall survival was evaluated using logistic and Cox regression models. RESULTS: A significant association between obesity and intermediate-abnormal cytogenetics was identified (OR: 1.94, P=0.025). Similarly, those with secondary AML were more likely to have poor risk (OR: 2.55, P<0.001) and less likely to have intermediate normal (OR: 0.48, P=0.003) cytogenetics. In multivariate analysis, overall survival was improved for patients >/= 60 years receiving intensive (RR: 0.21, P<0.001) and non-intensive therapy (RR: 0.40, P<0.001 compared to no treatment, and was lower for users of tobacco (RR 1.39, P=0.032), and those with poor risk cytogenetics (RR: 3.96, P=0.002) or poor performance status (RR: 1.69, P<0.001). Furthermore, an association between statin use at the time of diagnosis (OR: 2.89, P=0.016) and increased complete remission after intensive chemotherapy was identified, while prior solid organ transplantation was associated with significantly lower complete remission rate after therapy (OR: 0.10, P=0.035). CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that specific epidemiologic exposures, including obesity, are significantly associated with unique AML cytogenetic risk categories and response to therapy. This supports a link between patient lifestyles, clinical exposures, and leukemogenesis.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015. Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 10.,"1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] is known to act as a powerful differentiation inducer in various types of cancer cells, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. However, supraphysiological concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 required to induce terminal maturation of AML cells can cause lethal hypercalcemia in vivo. Here we characterized the differentiation-inducing effects of novel double-point modified analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 [1,25(OH)2D2], PRI-5201 and PRI-5202 [Pietraszek et al. (2013) Steroids, 78:1003-1014], on HL60, U937 and MOLM-13 human AML cells in comparison with their direct precursors (PRI-1906 and PRI-1907, respectively) and 1,25(OH)2D3. The results demonstrated the following order of potency for the tested compounds: PRI-5202>PRI-1907>PRI-5201>PRI-1906>/=1,25(OH)2D3, as determined by measuring the expression of cell surface markers of myeloid differentiation. Particularly, the sensitivity of different AML cell lines to PRI-5201 and PRI-5202 was 3-15-fold and 13-50 fold higher, respectively, compared to that of 1,25(OH)2D3. Importantly, all the analogs tested at 0.25-1nM concentrations retained the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to cooperate with the rosemary polyphenol carnosic acid, which strongly potentiated their prodifferentiation activity in a cell type-dependent manner. These synergistic effects were associated with increased induction of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) protein expression. However, surprisingly, carnosic acid was able to significantly enhance only 1,25(OH)2D3-induced transactivation of the direct repeat 3 (DR3)-type vitamin D response element (VDRE), whereas no such cooperation was seen with 1,25(OH)2D2 analogs. Furthermore, dose-response analysis revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 was more efficacious than the analogs in inducing VDRE activation. This suggests that the superior prodifferentiation activity of the analogs, as compared to 1,25(OH)2D3, may be due to their potential for enhanced activation of the differentiation-related VDRE(s) that differ from the DR3-type element tested in this study. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the new double-point modified 1,25(OH)2D2 analogs are much stronger inducers of myeloid differentiation than 1,25(OH)2D3 and that their efficacy can be further enhanced by combination with plant polyphenols. These combinations warrant their further mechanistic and translational exploration in AML and other types of cancer.",,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '55248-15-2 (1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Oct 23.,"Previous studies have shown that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) and mir146a were associated with the self-renewal of mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs); however, there is little information on their effects on the fate of livestock SSCs. Here, we have identified a regulatory pathway in dairy goat mGSCs, involving PLZF, mir146a and the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4. PLZF overexpression downregulated mir146a and simultaneously upregulated the expression of CXCR4 protein, whereas PLZF knockdown (siPLZF) induced the specifically opposite effects. The in vitro assays demonstrated that PLZF specifically interacts with and suppresses the mir146a promoter, and mir146a targets CXCR4 to impede its translation. The levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the mGSCs overexpressed CXCR4 and PLZF were upregulated, respectively, whereas mir146a expression was decreased and CXCR4 protein was increased. Mir146a overexpression and siPLZF impaired mGSC proliferation and differentiation, however, Mir146a knockdown induced the opposite effects. The effects of PLZF and mir146a were mediated regulation by mir146a and CXCR4, respectively. Overexpression of CXCR4 or addition of CXCL12 in cultures of dairy goat mGSCs resulted in the upregulation of their signaling, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was increased. Collectively, these findings indicate that PLZF is an important transcription factor in the regulation of the expression of CXCR4 to promote dairy goat mGSC proliferation by targeting mir146a.",,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"Estrogens are important immunomodulators, exerting significant effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cytokine production and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Estrogen receptors are expressed on normal B and T lymphocytes, bone marrow and in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Epidemiologic evidence for the association of menopausal hormone use with risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been mixed; however, all of the investigations have been observational. We analyzed the data from Women's Health Initiative hormone therapy trials where conjugated equine estrogens (CEE; 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 2.5 mg/d) (n = 16,654) or CEE alone (women with prior hysterectomy) (n = 10,685) were tested against placebos and the intervention lasted a median of 5.6 years in the CEE + MPA trial and 7.2 years in the CEE alone trial. During 13 years of follow-up through September 20, 2013 383 incident NHL cases were identified. We used the intent-to-treat approach to calculate incidence rates of NHL, hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by treatment group. Incidence of NHL was virtually the same in the treatment and placebo groups. The HR was 1.02 (95%CI 0.74-1.39) for CEE alone, 0.98 (95% CI 0.76-1.28) for CEE+MPA, and 1.00 (95% CI 0.82-1.22) for both combined. There were no specific NHL subtypes associated with either type of the treatment, except a marginally decreased risk of plasma cell neoplasms (HR= 0.53 95% CI 0.27-1.03) in the CEE-alone group. These results do not support a role of estrogen alone or combined with progestin in the development of NHL among postmenopausal women.","['32105-6/PHS HHS/United States', 'N01WH22110/WH/WHI NIH HHS/United States', '42107-26/PHS HHS/United States', '32100-2/PHS HHS/United States', '24152/PHS HHS/United States', '42129-32/PHS HHS/United States', '32118-32119/PHS HHS/United States', '32108-9/PHS HHS/United States', 'P30CA022453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '32122/PHS HHS/United States', '44221/PHS HHS/United States', '32111-13/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Estrogens, Conjugated (USP))', 'C2QI4IOI2G (Medroxyprogesterone Acetate)']",,['(c) 2015 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 19.,"PURPOSE: Relationships of farm history and insecticide exposure at home or work with lymphohematopoietic (LH) neoplasm risk were investigated in a large prospective cohort of US women. METHODS: In questionnaires, women self-reported history living or working on a farm, personally mixing or applying insecticides, insecticide application in the home or workplace by a commercial service, and treating pets with insecticides. Relationships with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, plasma cell neoplasms, and myeloid leukemia were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models. Age and farming history were explored as effect modifiers. RESULTS: The analysis included 76,493 women and 822 NHL cases. Women who ever lived or worked on a farm had 1.12 times the risk of NHL (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95-1.32) compared to those who did not. Women who reported that a commercial service ever applied insecticides in their immediate surroundings had 65% higher risk of CLL/SLL (95% CI = 1.15-2.38). Women aged less than 65 years who ever applied insecticides had 87% higher risk of DLBCL (95% CI = 1.13-3.09). CONCLUSIONS: Insecticide exposures may contribute to risk of CLL/SLL and DLBCL.

AREAS COVERED: We will review the major published clinical trials for untreated AML that have established the dosing choice and schedule for intensive therapy, as well as trials for patients not eligible for more intensive therapy. We will also discuss treatment considerations for subgroups of patients. EXPERT OPINION: While one or two cycles of anthracycline and cytarabine-based combination regimens remain the standard of care for younger and older patients with AML deemed fit to receive induction chemotherapy, controversy remains regarding the optimal selection and dosing schedule for anthracyclines. Low-intensity regimens, such as low-dose cytarabine and hypomethylating agents, can achieve a complete response even with adverse risk features, and can be used in a fit subset of older patients not eligible for clinical trial or transplant. Incorporation of new targeted agents, such as tyrosine kinase and small-molecule inhibitors, combined with better selection of drugs for unique patient cohorts, will likely be necessary to substantially improve outcomes in AML.",,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of imatinib and other TKIs (e.g., nilotinib, dasatinib) has made allogeneic HSCT a later-line therapy that is reserved only for advanced-phase, high-risk, or TKI-resistant patients with CML. Accumulating evidence from clinical trials investigating treatment-free remission suggests that TKIs may also provide an operational cure for some patients with CML.

However, the first-generation pan-PI3K and dual-PI3K/mTOR inhibitors have encountered problems in clinical trials, with limited efficacies as a monotherapeutic agent as well as a relatively high rate of side effects. It is increasingly recognized that different PI3K isoforms play non-redundant roles in particular tumor types, which has prompted the development of isoform-selective inhibitors for pre-selected patients with the aim for improving efficacy while decreasing undesirable side effects. The success of PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors is represented by CAL101 (Idelalisib), a first-in-class PI3Kdelta-selective small-molecule inhibitor that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma. Inhibitors targeting other PI3K isoforms are also being extensively developed. This review focuses on the recent progress in development of PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors for cancer therapy. A deeper understanding of the action modes of novel PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors will provide valuable information to further validate the concept of targeting specific PI3K isoforms, while the identification of biomarkers to stratify patients who are likely to benefit from the therapy will be essential for the success of these agents.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To guide physicians, several prognostic factors have been identified and risk scores developed. Recently, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine has become available for use in MDS and AML patients with up to 30% bone marrow blasts. However, limited data are available on the outcome of older unfit AML patients, regardless of their bone marrow blast count. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 90 newly diagnosed older unfit AML patients in 9 Institutions from the Apulia Region (REP). Responder patients (evaluation performed after 4 cycles of treatment even in cases of primary failure) showed a better overall survival than non responders (23 vs 6 months, p<.001). ECOG PS>/=2 seems to be correlated with OS in multivariate analysis, while neither primary treatment failure (documented after 2 cycles) nor bone marrow blast count were correlated with a worse overall survival either at univariate (22 vs 29 months, p=.ns; 16 vs 19 months, p=.ns) or multivariate analysis.

Chemical inhibition of the stress protein HSP90 was demonstrated in vitro to inhibit T-cell activation and to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to which intestinal cells are highly susceptible. Since the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) is developed in clinics, we explored here its ability to control intestinal acute GvHD in vivo in two mouse GvHD models (C57BL/6short right arrowBALB/c and FVB/Nshort right arrowLgr5-eGFP), ex vivo in intestine organoids and in vitro in intestinal epithelial cultures. We show that 17AAG decreases GvHD-associated mortality without impairing graft versus leukemia effect. While 17AAG effect in T-cell activation is just moderate at the dose used in vivo, we observe a striking intestinal integrity protection. At the intestine level, the drug promotes the splicing of the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), which is a key component of the ER stress. This effect is associated with a decrease in intestinal damage and an increase in Lgr5(+) stem cells, Paneth cells and defensins production. The importance of XBP1 splicing control is further confirmed in cultured cells and organoids of primary intestinal epithelium where XBP1 is either shRNA depleted or inhibited with toyocamycin. In conclusion, 17AAG has a protective effect on the epithelial intestinal barrier in mouse models of acute GvHD. This compound deserves to be tested in the therapeutic control of acute GvHD.",,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Xbp1 protein, mouse)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)']",,,,,,['Oncogene. 2016 Jun 2;35(22):2948.

METHODS: From June to September in 2014, 199 adolescents aged 11 to 21 participated in the study as they visited the out-patient clinic at C university hospital for follow-up care. To verify the predictors and the effects of resilience, uncertainty, symptom distress, perceived social support, spiritual perspective, defensive coping, courageous coping, hope, and self-transcendence were measured. Collected data were analyzed using hierarchical regression analysis with the SAS statistics program. RESULTS: The final regression model showed that courageous coping, hope, and self-transcendence were significant predictors related to resilience in adolescents with leukemia and explained for 63% of the variance in resilience. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that adolescent-oriented intervention programs enhancing courageous coping, hope, and self-transcendence should be provide for adolescents with leukemia in order to overcome illness-related stress and support physical, psychological and social adjustment.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the few high-quality studies, there are no evidence-based guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in this patient population. We sought to determine the spectrum of practice regarding prevention of VTE in patients with AL during induction and consolidation therapies. METHODS: We conducted a 19-question Web-based survey directed at North American providers caring for these patients. One hundred fifty-one of 215 responses received were eligible for analysis, with a response rate of 20.9% among physicians who treated leukemias. RESULTS: Overall, 47% and 45% of providers reported using pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis during induction and consolidation phases, respectively. Approximately 15% of providers did not provide any VTE prophylaxis, while 36% used mechanical methods and ambulation. Among providers who did not recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis, the most commonly cited reasons were the perceived high risk of bleeding (51%), absence of data supporting use (38%), and perceived low risk of VTE (11%). CONCLUSION: Large, prospective studies are needed to define the safest and most effective approach to VTE prevention in patients with AL.","['U10 CA180826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)'],,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This series describes an experience of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with hematologic malignancies, and highlights the technical considerations to be kept in mind. METHODS: Between June 2011 and April 2014, 133 consecutive high-risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis were treated with TAVI at our centre. Based on consensus among the local heart team, five patients with hematologic malignancies (myelodysplastic syndrome [2],chronic lymphocytic leukemia [2], Hodgkin lymphoma [1]) were considered high risk for surgery (Logistic EUROSCORE 17.2+/-14.0% and STS score 5.8+/-4.3%). Serial echocardiographic and clinical follow-ups were done pre- and post-procedure, at discharge, and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Our procedural success rate was 80%. Two heart valves were implanted in one patient due to aortic embolization of the previous valve. Perforation of the right ventricle and cardiac tamponade occurred in the same patient. Mean blood transfusion requirement was 1.0+/-1.4 U (range: 0 to 3 U). Mean aortic valve gradient was reduced from baseline to 9.2+/-3.27 mmHg, and the effective orifice area was significantly increased to 1.96+/-0.29 cm2. Paravalvular aortic regurgitation (AR) was absent-mild in all the patients. CONCLUSION: This present series demonstrates that TAVI with a balloon-expandable valve can be performed safely and effectively and is technically feasible in high-risk patients with hematologic malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study between 2004 and 2013 in the University Hospital Center of Nantes (France) recruited patients with lymphoma discovered by sinonasal involvement. Epidemiologic, diagnostic, clinical and prognostic criteria were analyzed, with survival studied on the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Log-rank test. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included: 14 male, 7 female, with a mean age of 65 years at diagnosis. All had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with strong predominance of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (77%). Seven patients had risk factors for lymphoma (infection by HIV, EBV or chronic lymphocytic leukemia). A majority (68%) had advanced tumor at diagnosis (stage IV on the Ann Arbor classification). Most were located in the craniofacial bones (68%), mainly involving the maxillary or ethmoidal sinuses. The most frequent presenting symptoms were unilateral nasal obstruction, mucopurulent rhinorrhea, recurrent epistaxis or diplopia. Treatment consisted in chemotherapy, in some cases associated to radiotherapy. Overall survival was 82% at 12 months and 73% at 36 months. Recurrence-free survival was 76% at 12 months and 64% at 36 months. CONCLUSION: Lymphoma is an aggressive pathology; revelation by sinonasal involvement is rare. Recommended treatment is chemotherapy, possibly associated to radiotherapy. Prognosis depends on histologic type, Ann Arbor stage at diagnosis and the therapeutic options available for the individual patient.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2015 Sep 9.,"Disease relapse is the major causes of treatment failure after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As well as demonstrating significant clinical activity in AML, azacitidine (AZA) upregulates putative tumor antigens, inducing a CD8(+) T cell response with the potential to augment a graft-versus-leukemia effect. We, therefore, studied the feasibility and clinical sequelae of the administration of AZA during the first year after transplantation in 51 patients with AML undergoing allogeneic SCT. Fourteen patients did not commence AZA either because of transplantation complications or withdrawal of consent. Thirty-seven patients commenced AZA at a median of 54 days (range, 40 to 194 days) after transplantation, which was well tolerated in the majority of patients. Thirty-one patients completed 3 or more cycles of AZA. Sixteen patients relapsed at a median time of 8 months after transplantation. No patient developed extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease. The induction of a post-transplantation CD8(+) T cell response to 1 or more tumor-specific peptides was studied in 28 patients. Induction of a CD8(+) T cell response was associated with a reduced risk of disease relapse (hazard ratio [HR], .30; 95% confidence interval [CI], .10 to .85; P = .02) and improved relapse-free survival (HR, .29; 95% CI, .10 to .83; P = .02) taking into account death as a competing risk. In conclusion, AZA is well tolerated after transplantation and appears to have the capacity to reduce the relapse risk in patients who demonstrate a CD8(+) T cell response to tumor antigens.

The viral oncoprotein Tax perturbs cellular signaling pathways leading to upregulation of host cell factors, amongst them the actin-bundling protein Fascin, an invasion marker of several types of cancer. However, transcriptional regulation of Fascin by Tax is poorly understood. In this study, we identified a triple mode of transcriptional induction of Fascin by Tax, which requires (1) NF-kappaB-dependent promoter activation, (2) a Tax-responsive region in the Fascin promoter, and (3) a promoter-independent mechanism sensitive to the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2. Thus, Tax regulates Fascin by a multitude of signals. Beyond, using Tax-expressing and virus-transformed lymphocytes as a model system, our study is the first to identify the invasion marker Fascin as a novel target of PP2, an inhibitor of metastasis.",,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '146808-54-0 (fascin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In humans, ARG isoform 1 is also expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage. ARG activity promotes tumour growth and inhibits T lymphocyte activation. However, the two ARG transgenic mouse lines produced so far failed to show such effects. We have generated, in two different genetic backgrounds, transgenic mice constitutively expressing ARG1 under the control of the CD68 promoter in macrophages and monocytes. Both heterozygous and homozygous transgenic mice showed a relevant increase in mortality at early age, compared with wild-type siblings (67/267 and 48/181 versus 8/149, respectively, both P < 0.005). This increase was due to high incidence of haematologic malignancies, in particular myeloid leukaemia, myeloid dysplasia, lymphomas and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), diseases that were absent in wild-type mice. Atrophy of lymphoid organs due to reduction in T-cell compartment was also detected. Our results indicate that ARG activity may participate in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative disorders, suggest the involvement of alterations of L-arginine metabolism in the onset of DIC and confirm a role for the enzyme in regulating T-cell homeostasis.",['08-0518/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['EC 3.5.3.1 (Arg1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",,"['(c) The Author 2015.

We found that the p14, p15, and p57 genes were not expressed in ALL cell lines (Molt-4 and Nalm-6) and adult ALL patients, whereas mTOR, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K were highly expressed. In Molt-4 and Nalm-6 cells exposed to rapamycin, cell viability decreased and the cell cycle was arrested at the G1/S phase. Rapamycin restored p14, p15, and p57 gene expression through demethylation of the promoters of these genes. As expected, rapamycin also increased p14 and p15 protein expression in both Molt-4 and Nalm-6 cells, as well as p57 protein expression in Nalm-6 cells. Rapamycin additionally decreased mTOR and p70S6K mRNA levels, as well as p70S6K and p-p70S6K protein levels. However, depletion of mTOR by siRNA did not alter the expression and promoter methylation states of p14, p15, and p57. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin may be due mainly to increased p14, p15, and p57 expression via promoter demethylation and decreased mTOR and p70S6K expression in ALL cell lines. These results suggest a potential role for rapamycin in the treatment of adult ALL.",,"['0 (CDK2AP2 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1C protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T. gondii antibodies were examined in cat sera by the modified agglutination test (MAT). The circulating antigens of D. immitis and FeLV and specific antibodies to FIV were examined using kits commercially available. The overall prevalence of T. gondii, FIV, FeLV, and D. immitis was 19.34, 9.12, 11.33, and 3.04 %, respectively. For the genetic characterization of T. gondii genotypes in cats, genomic DNA was extracted from the seropositive cats and the T. gondii B1 gene was amplified using a semi-nested PCR. DNA samples giving positive B1 amplification were then genotyped using multilocus PCR-RFLP. Two T. gondii genotypes (ToxoDB#9 and ToxoDB#1) were identified. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that older cats are more likely to be seropositive than juveniles for T. gondii, FIV, FeLV, and D. immitis. This is the first report of T. gondii genotypes in cats in northwest China. Moreover, the present study is the first study of retrovirus and D. immitis seroprevalence in cats in China.

A natural compound oleanolic acid (OA) was found to be active against many types of neoplastic cells. This paper examines the influence of eight semisynthetic oleanolic acid derivatives on drug-sensitive human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and its multidrug resistant subline ABCC1 overexpressing HL-60/AR. Viability inhibition, proapoptotic activity, as well as influence on the ABCC1 gene expression level, ability to inhibit the transport function of multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (ABCC1) and to alter its level by the tested compounds, were evaluated. The most potent compounds were DIOXOL (methyl 3,11-dioxoolean-12-en-28-oate) and HIMOXOL (methyl 3-hydroxyimino-11-oxoolean-12-en-28-oate). DIOXOL was most efficient in inducing apoptosis of HL-60 cells. It activated both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptotic cell death. Proapoptotic properties of DIOXOL were probably related to the significant decrease of p65 NFkappaB level and inhibition of its translocation to the nucleus. In turn, HIMOXOL was the most potent compound against resistant HL-60/AR cells. It inhibited ABCC1 transport function (short time response) and decreased the level of ABCC1 protein (long time response) as a result of reduction of ABCC1 expression.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (methyl 3,11-dioxoolean-12-en-28-oate)', '0 (methyl 3-hydroxyimino-11-oxoolean-12-en-28-oate)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Sep 8.,"UNLABELLED: Negative BCR ABL myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (MFP) are clonal hematological malignancies and may lead to a high risk of venous, arterial or microcirculatory thrombosis. Atypical sites of thrombosis can sometimes reveal the neoplasm disorder. Their diagnoses are a major issue because of the propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia and/or myelofibrosis. The acquired JAK2V617F variant (Janus kinase 2; 9p24) is a prevalent MPN and also a sensitive marker for PV diagnosis (95% positive mutation), but not specific since found in approximately 50% of patients with ET and MFP. PATIENT AND METHODS: We present a diagnostic and a therapeutic approach based on one patient with microcirculatory ischemic manifestations in the toes, and who had strictly normal cell blood counts and was positive for JAK2V617F mutation: thrombotic risk factor evaluation; bone marrow biopsy; red cell adhesion assays. These experimental assays are promising for the development of new therapeutics in MPN; they assess red cell adherence to the vascular endothelium after the phosphorylation of Lu/BCAM subsequent to a positive JAK2V617F mutation. RESULTS: Compared with controls, our patient exhibited increased Lu/BCAM receptor phosphorylation and red blood cell adhesion. CONCLUSION: This development may lead to improved care for patients with thrombotic manifestations, normal blood cell counts, and a positive JAK2V617F mutation: multidisciplinary management, including regular hematological monitoring, could lead to the introduction of a cytoreductive treatment.",,"['0 (BCAM protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Lutheran Blood-Group System)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This occurs in allogeneic recipients, in both the haploidentical and HLA-matched settings. METHODS: To gain further insight, not only NKG2A, but also the activating receptors NKG2C and NKG2D were assessed by flow cytometry. Immunophenotyping was carried out not only on CD56(+) but also on CD8(+) lymphocytes from leukemia and lymphoma patients, receiving both HLA-matched (n = 7) and autologous (n = 5) HSCT grafts. Moreover, cognate NKG2 ligands (HLA-E, MICA, ULBP-1, ULBP-2 and ULBP-3) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in diagnostic biopsies from three autotransplanted patients, and at relapse in one case. RESULTS: All the NKG2 receptors were simultaneously up-regulated in all the allotransplanted patients on CD8(+) and/or CD56(+) cells between 30 and 90 days post-transplant, coinciding with, or following, allogeneic engraftment. Up-regulation was of lesser entity and restricted to CD8(+) cells in the autotransplantation setting. The phenotypic expression ratio between activating and inhibitory NKG2 receptors was remarkably similar in all the patients, except two outliers (a long survivor and a short survivor) who surprisingly displayed a similar NKG2 activation immunophenotype. Tumor expression of 2 to 3 out of the 5 tested NKG2 ligands was observed in 3/3 diagnostic biopsies, and 3 ligands were up-regulated post-transplant in a patient. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results are consistent with a dual (activation-inhibition) NK cell re-education mode, an innate-like T cell re-tuning, and a ligand:receptor interplay between the tumor and the immune system following HSCT including, most interestingly, the up-regulation of several activating NKG2 ligands. Turning the immune receptor balance toward activation on both T and NK cells of donor origin may complement ex vivo NK cell expansion/activation strategies in unmanipulated patients.",,['0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intensive combination chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been introduced since the previous Japanese nationwide survey was performed in the late 1980s. In this study, we delineated the current features and management of ATL in Japan. The clinical data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients diagnosed with ATL between 2000 and 2009, and a total of 1665 patients' records were submitted to the central office from 84 institutions in Japan. Seventy-one patients were excluded; 895, 355, 187, and 157 patients with acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types, respectively, remained. The median survival times were 8.3, 10.6, 31.5, and 55.0 months, and 4-year overall survival (OS) rates were 11%, 16%, 36%, and 52%, respectively, for acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The number of patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 227, and their median survival time and OS at 4 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 5.9 months and 26%, respectively. This study revealed that the prognoses of the patients with acute and lymphoma types were still unsatisfactory, despite the recent progress in treatment modalities, but an improvement of 4-year OS was observed in comparison with the previous survey. Of note, one-quarter of patients who could undergo transplantation experienced long survival.

Epub 2015 Sep 11.,"It is generally assumed that gain- and loss-of-function manipulations of a functionally important gene should lead to the opposite phenotypes. We show in this study that both overexpression and knockout of microRNA (miR)-126 surprisingly result in enhanced leukemogenesis in cooperation with the t(8;21) fusion genes AML1-ETO/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and AML1-ETO9a (a potent oncogenic isoform of AML1-ETO). In accordance with our observation that increased expression of miR-126 is associated with unfavorable survival in patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we show that miR-126 overexpression exhibits a stronger effect on long-term survival and progression of AML1-ETO9a-mediated leukemia stem cells/leukemia initiating cells (LSCs/LICs) in mice than does miR-126 knockout. Furthermore, miR-126 knockout substantially enhances responsiveness of leukemia cells to standard chemotherapy. Mechanistically, miR-126 overexpression activates genes that are highly expressed in LSCs/LICs and/or primitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, likely through targeting ERRFI1 and SPRED1, whereas miR-126 knockout activates genes that are highly expressed in committed, more differentiated hematopoietic progenitor cells, presumably through inducing FZD7 expression.

The primary aims of this study were as follows: (1) to assess whether age at diagnosis and treatment-related factors are associated with dental defects in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and (2) to assess the survivors' annual expenses for dental treatment compared to reference data. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 111 Norwegian survivors of ALL diagnosed before the age of 16. All of the subjects completed a questionnaire and underwent medical and oral examinations. Dental defects were registered according to the individual defect index, with 0 = no defects and 140 = anodontia, and the caries experience was registered according to the decayed-missing-filled teeth index (DMFT). Age-matched reference data were drawn from a national general population survey (n = 555). RESULTS: The mean age at examination was 29.1 years (SD 7.2), and mean follow-up period was 22.9 years (SD 7.3). In a regression model, diagnoses occurring at </=5 years of age (B = -9.6, p < 0.001) and a cumulative dose of anthracyclines >120 mg/m(2) (B = 11.5, p < 0.001) were strongly associated with more severe dental defects. Survivors treated after the age of 5 had experienced more caries than those treated at a younger age [DMFT 9.6 (SD 6.1) vs. 6.0 (SD 4.6), respectively; p = 0.001]. High annual expenses for dental treatment were reported by a larger percentage of the reference population compared to the survivor group (18 vs. 9 %, respectively; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The age at diagnosis and the dose of anthracyclines appear to be strongly associated with the severity of dental defects, although few survivors reported high annual expenses for dental treatment. The increased risk of dental defects during adulthood should be communicated to ALL survivors.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunosuppressive therapy is thought to be the main cause in these cases. CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old woman accepted a right kidney transplantation because of her chronic renal insufficiency and uremia in May 2011. She had to receive a left kidney transplantation again in February 2012 because she had renal failure again after receiving the right kidney transplantation. She received immune inhibitors treatment. After the latter operation, her renal function was normal. The third operation was done to remove the right transplanted kidney in July 2012. The diagnosis of the kidney was myeloid sarcoma. The blood and bone marrow biopsy had no evidence of leukemia. She then received chemotherapy. There was a small skin nodule on the left arm of approximately 0.5 cm in August 2012; after that its diameter enlarged progressively to about 5 cm and more nodules and masses gradually appeared on her face, arms, trunk, lower limbs, and feet over the course of 1 year. The skin biopsy specimen obtained from her left arm showed myeloid sarcoma too. She was admitted to the Orthopedics Department for severe pain and swelling in the left foot in September 2014 and underwent an operation for resecting the mass in the left foot. Pain was apparently alleviated and the incision healed well. CONCLUSIONS: The patient is still alive with no evidence of leukemia after a 30-month follow-up.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

Epub 2015 Aug 5.,"INTRODUCTION: This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of arsenic trioxide (ATO) added to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) when used in first-line acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed with 3 states: stable disease (during first- or second-line treatment), disease event, and death. Newly diagnosed patients with low- to intermediate-risk APL were included and each month could remain in their current health state or move to another. Treatment consisted of ATO + ATRA, ATRA + idarubicin (IDA), or ATRA + cytarabine (AraC) + additional chemotherapy. After an initial disease event, patients discontinued first-line therapy and switched to a second-line ATO regimen. Efficacy and safety data were obtained from published trials; quality of life/utility estimates were obtained from the literature; costs were obtained from US data sources. Costs and outcomes over time were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared to ATRA + AraC + additional chemotherapy, ATRA + IDA treatment had ICERs of $2933 per life-year (LY) saved and $3122 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared to the ATRA + IDA regimen, first-line ATO + ATRA treatment had ICERs of $4512 per LY saved and $5614 per QALY gained. Results were sensitive to changes in pharmacy costs of the ATO + ATRA regimen during consolidation. CONCLUSION: The ATO + ATRA regimen is highly cost-effective compared to ATRA + AraC + additional chemotherapy or ATRA + IDA in the treatment of newly diagnosed low- to intermediate-risk APL patients.",['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AIM: To report the demographic and clinical features of patients with IBD who developed a malignant tumor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of an IBD patient registry of a private clinic, diagnosed between 1976 and 2014. RESULTS: 437 subjects were included, aged 15-88 years (58% women). Seventy two percent of patients had ulcerative colitis. The median time of follow up was 6 years. Ten patients (2.3%) developed a malignant tumor. In four, the tumor could be related to IBD (two colorectal cancers, one cholangiocarcinoma and one chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)). Two of 45 patients treated with biological therapy developed a tumor (CML and hypernephroma). Three of 170 patients on immunosuppressive treatment developed tumors. Only one had a tumor possibly related with the use of azathioprine (non-melanoma skin cancer). In only two patients, the treatment was changed at the time of their cancer diagnosis, from immunosuppressive medications to mesalamine. CONCLUSIONS: Only a small proportion of these patients with IBD developed a malignant tumor. The treatment of IBD has to be determined by the severity of the disease and not by the fear of developing a neoplasia.

Based on our previous observation in acute myeloid leukemia we investigated the impact of pre-transplant weight loss on post-transplant outcome in MDS patients. A total of 111 patients diagnosed with MDS according to WHO criteria transplanted between 2000 and 2012 in three different transplant centers were included into the analysis. Data on weight loss were collected from medical records prior to conditioning therapy and 3-6 months earlier. Patient, disease and transplant characteristics did not differ between patients with weight loss (2-5%, n = 17; > 5%, n = 17) and those without (n = 77). In a mixed effect model, weight loss was associated with higher risk MDS (p = 0.046). In multivariable analyses, pre-transplant weight loss exceeding 5% was associated with a higher incidence of relapse (p < 0.001) and NRM (p = 0.007). Pre-transplant weight loss of 2-5% and > 5% were independent predictors of worse disease-free (p = 0.023 and p < 0.001, respectively) and overall survival (p = 0.043 and p < 0.001, respectively).

The Protein Epitope Mimetic POL5551 is a novel and potent antagonist of CXCR4. POL5551 efficiently mobilizes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, but its effects in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that POL5551 is a potent antagonist of CXCR4 in pre-B and T cell ALL cell lines and pediatric ALL primary samples. POL5551 has activity at nanomolar concentrations in decreasing CXCR4 antibody binding, blocking SDF-1alpha-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, inhibiting SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis, and reversing stromal-mediated protection from chemotherapy. POL5551 is significantly more effective at inhibiting CXCR4 antibody binding than the FDA-approved CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor in ALL cell lines and primary samples. We also show that treatment with POL5551 in vitro and cytarabine +/- POL5551 in vivo modulates surface expression of adhesion molecules, findings that may guide the optimal clinical use of POL5551. Finally, we demonstrate that POL5551 increases sensitivity to cytarabine in a xenograft model of a high-risk pediatric ALL, infant MLL-rearranged (MLL-R) ALL. Therefore, disruption of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis with POL5551 may improve outcomes in children with high-risk ALL.","['K12 CA090433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA090433-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (POL5551)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Focusing on the extensively studied family of thiosemicarbazone (TSC) compounds, we have previously identified 4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone thiosemicarbazone (T44Bf) as a promising pharmacological compound in a panel of human leukemia cell lines (HL60, U937, KG1a and Jurkat). Present findings indicate that T44Bf-mediated antiproliferative effects are associated with a reversible chronic mitotic arrest caused by defects in chromosome alignment, followed by induced programmed cell death. Furthermore, T44Bf selectively induces apoptosis in leukemia cell lines when compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The underlying mechanism of action involves the activation of the mitochondria signaling pathway, with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and sustained phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL as well as increased Bcl-2 (enhanced phosphorylated fraction) and pro-apoptotic protein Bad levels. In addition, ERK signaling pathway activation was found to be a requisite for T44Bf apoptotic activity. Our findings further describe a novel activity for a benzophenone thiosemicarbazone and propose T44Bf as a promising anti-mitotic prototype to develop chemotherapeutic agents to treat acute leukemia malignancies.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzophenones)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '701M4TTV9O (benzophenone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the era of personalized medicine, flow cytometry could be used as a rapid method for selection of optimal therapies, which may include drugs that target the Erk pathway. Here, we evaluated the utility of phospho-flow, compared to Western blotting, to monitor Erk pathway activation and its inhibition by targeted Mek kinase inhibitors in human BCP ALL. Because the Erk pathway is not only activated endogenously, by mutations, but also by normal extracellular stimulation through stromal contact and serum growth factors, we compared Erk activation ex vivo in ALL cells in the presence and absence of stroma and serum. Phospho-flow was able to readily detect changes in the pool of pErk1/2 that had been generated by normal microenvironmental stimuli in patient-derived BCP-ALL cells passaged in NSG mice, in viably frozen primary patient samples, and in fresh patient samples. Treatment with the Mek1/2 inhibitor selumetinib resulted in a rapid, complete and persistent reduction of microenvironment-generated pErk1/2. Imaging flow cytometry confirmed reduction of nuclear pErk1/2 upon selumetinib treatment. An ALL relapsing with an activating KRasG12V mutation contained higher endogenous as well as serum/stromal-stimulated levels of pErk1/2 than the matched diagnosis sample which lacked the mutation, but selumetinib treatment reduced pErk1/2 to the same level in both samples.

Unfortunately, the evacuation resulted in increased mortalities among nursing home residents. We assessed the risk trade-off between evacuation and radiation for 191 residents and 184 staff at three nursing homes by using the same detriment indicator, namely loss of life expectancy (LLE), under four scenarios, i.e. ""rapid evacuation (in accordance with the actual situation; i.e. evacuation on 22 March),"" ""deliberate evacuation (i.e. evacuation on 20 June),"" ""20-mSv exposure,"" and ""100-mSv exposure."" The LLE from evacuation-related mortality among nursing home residents was assessed with survival probability data from nursing homes in the city of Minamisoma and the city of Soma. The LLE from radiation mortality was calculated from the estimated age-specific mortality rates from leukemia and all solid cancers based on the additional effective doses and the survival probabilities. The total LLE of residents due to evacuation-related risks in rapid evacuation was 11,000 persons-d-much higher than the total LLEs of residents and staff due to radiation in the other scenarios (27, 1100, and 5800 persons-d for deliberate evacuation, 20 mSv-exposure, and 100 mSv-exposure, respectively). The latitude for reducing evacuation risks among nursing home residents is surprisingly large. Evacuation regulation and planning should therefore be well balanced with the trade-offs against radiation risks. This is the first quantitative assessment of the risk trade-off between radiation exposure and evacuation after a nuclear power plant accident.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The widely accepted two-lesion kinetic (TLK) model assumes two kinds of double strand breaks, simple and complex ones, with different repair rates. Recently, persistent DNA damage associated with telomeres was reported as a new kind of DNA damage. We therefore extended existing versions of the TLK model by new categories of DNA damage and re-evaluated those models using extensive data. We subjected different versions of the TLK model to a rigorous model discrimination approach. This enabled us to robustly select a best approximating parsimonious model that can both recapitulate and predict transient and persistent DNA damage after ionizing radiation. Models and data argue for i) nonlinear dose-damage relationships, and ii) negligible saturation of repair kinetics even for high doses. Additionally, we show that simulated radiation-induced persistent telomere-associated DNA damage foci (TAF) can be used to predict excess relative risk (ERR) of developing secondary leukemia after fractionated radiotherapy. We suggest that TAF may serve as an additional measure to predict cancer risk after radiotherapy using high dose rates. This may improve predicting risk-dose dependency of ionizing radiation especially for long-term therapies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 10.,"OBJECTIVE: Ibrutinib is an irreversible Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma that increases the risk of bleeding among patients. Platelets from ibrutinib-treated patients exhibit deficiencies in collagen-evoked signaling in suspension; however, the significance of this observation and how it relates to bleeding risk is unclear, as platelets encounter immobile collagen in vivo. We sought to clarify the effects of ibrutinib on platelet function to better understand the mechanism underlying bleeding risk. APPROACH AND RESULTS: By comparing signaling in suspension and during adhesion to immobilized ligands, we found that the collagen signaling deficiency caused by ibrutinib is milder during adhesion to immobilized collagen. We also found that platelets in whole blood treated with ibrutinib adhered to collagen under arterial shear but formed unstable thrombi, suggesting that the collagen signaling deficiency caused by ibrutinib may not be the predominant cause of bleeding in vivo. However, clot retraction and signaling evoked by platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen were also inhibited by ibrutinib, indicating that integrin alphaIIbbeta3 outside-in signaling is also effected in addition to GPVI signaling. When ibrutinib was combined with the P2Y12 inhibitor, cangrelor, thrombus formation under arterial shear was inhibited additively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that (1) ibrutinib causes GPVI and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 platelet signaling deficiencies that result in formation of unstable thrombi and may contribute toward bleeding observed in vivo and (2) combining ibrutinib with P2Y12 antagonists, which also inhibit thrombus stability, may have a detrimental effect on hemostasis.","['PG/13/93/30593/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'RG/15/2/31224/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'RG/09/011/28094/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'PG/11/125/29320/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'NH/10/2/28425/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom']","['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '6AQ1Y404U7 (cangrelor)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,"['(c) 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deeper mechanistic understanding may improve TKI combination therapies to better control the residual leukemic cell population. In analyzing our patients' data, we found that many patients who otherwise responded well to imatinib therapy still showed variations in their BCR-ABL transcripts. To investigate this phenomenon, we applied a mathematical model that integrates CML and an autologous immune response to the patients' data. We define an immune window or a range of leukemic loads for which the autologous immune system induces an improved response. Our modeling results suggest that, at diagnosis, a patient's leukemic load is able to partially or fully suppress the autologous immune response developed in a majority of patients, toward the CML clone(s). Imatinib therapy drives the leukemic population into the ""immune window,"" allowing the patient's autologous immune cells to expand and eventually mount an efficient recognition of the residual leukemic burden. This response drives the leukemic load below this immune window, allowing the leukemic population to partially recover until another weaker immune response is initiated. Thus, the autologous immune response may explain the oscillations in BCR-ABL transcripts regularly observed in patients on imatinib.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 10.,"OBJECTIVES: In systemic sclerosis (SSc), vascular involvement is characterised by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) system disturbances. Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a receptor for both class-3 semaphorins (Sema3s) and VEGF-A, is required for optimal VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signalling. Here, we investigated the possible involvement of Sema3A/NRP1 axis in SSc. METHODS: Circulating Sema3A and soluble NRP1 (sNRP1) were measured in patients with SSc and controls. NRP1 and Sema3A expression in skin biopsies was evaluated by immunofluorescence and western blotting. NRP1 expression was assessed in SSc and healthy dermal microvascular endothelial cells (SSc-MVECs and H-MVECs), and in SSc and control endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-derived endothelial cells (ECs). The possible impact of transcription factor Friend leukaemia integration 1 (Fli1) deficiency on endothelial NRP1 expression was investigated by gene silencing. The binding of Fli1 to NRP1 gene promoter was evaluated using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Capillary morphogenesis was performed on Matrigel. RESULTS: Decreased sNRP1 levels in SSc were associated with active and late nailfold videocapillaroscopy patterns and digital ulcers. No difference in Sema3A was found between patients and controls. NRP1 was significantly decreased in SSc-MVECs both ex vivo and in vitro. NRP1 and Fli1 significantly decreased in H-MVECs challenged with SSc sera, while they were not different in SSc and control EPC-derived ECs. Fli1 occupied the NRP1 gene promoter and Fli1 gene silencing reduced NRP1 expression in H-MVECs. NRP1 gene silencing in H-MVECs resulted in a significantly impaired angiogenic capacity comparable to that of cells treated with SSc sera. CONCLUSION: In SSc, NRP1 deficiency may be an additional factor in the perturbed VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 system contributing to peripheral microvasculopathy and defective angiogenesis.",,"['0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (SEMA3A protein, human)', '0 (Semaphorin-3A)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)']",,"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Epub 2015 Sep 11.,"INTRODUCTION: Ibrutinib , a targeted inhibitor of B-cell receptor signaling, achieved impressive clinical results for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). These results allowed the approval of ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy and those with a 17p deletion regardless of line of therapy. AREAS COVERED: Comprehensive data from either Phase I-II or randomized Phase III studies are analyzed in this article. In addition, we reviewed data on the prevalence and the clinical management of some peculiar toxicities ibrutinib related such as lymphocytosis, major bleeding and atrial fibrillation. EXPERT OPINION: Ibrutinib has radically changed the scenery of relapsed/refractory CLL treatment and established an important paradigm in the molecularly targeted approach of this disease. Discontinuation of ibrutinib is rarely due to adverse events related to the drug. Patients who discontinue treatment represent a challenge to the physicians because treatment options are very limited.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The 5-week-old female BALB/c-nu mice were randomly divided into blank control group, normal Jurkat cell control group, empty virus-transfected Jurkat cell control group and CBP over-expression model group, 5 mice in each group. The mice were subcutaneously injected 1x10(7)/0.1 mL Jurkat cells in axillary area. The tumor tissues of mouse models were weighed and then subjected to HE staining to observe the pathological changes of tumor tissues. The proliferation of Jurkat cells in the peripheral blood of mice was detected by flow cytometry, and the interleukin 2 (IL-2) levels in mouse sera were determined with ELISA. RESULTS: The volume of tumor tissues in the CBP over-expression model group was smaller than that in the control groups, so was the mass of tumor tissues. HE staining showed the proliferation of Jurkat cells in tumor tissues of the model group. The proliferation rate of Jurkat cells in the peripheral blood and IL-2 levels in the sera of the CBP over-expression model group were lower than those in the normal Jurkat cell control group and the empty virus-transfected Jurkat cell control group. CONCLUSION: The mouse models of Jurkat T-leukemia cells over-expressing CBP have been established successfully. Up-regulated CBP has inhibitory effects on the proliferation of Jurkat cells and IL-2 secretion.",,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PAG1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that MDSCs from myostatin null mice (Mstn (-/-) ) can be readily induced into pluripotent stem cells without using reprogramming factors. Microarray studies revealed a strong upregulation of markers like Leukemia Inhibitory factor (LIF) and Leukemia Inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) in Mstn (-/-) MDSCs as compared to wild type MDSCs (WT-MDSCs). Furthermore when cultured in mouse embryonic stem cell media with LIF for 95 days, Mstn (-/-) MDSCs formed embryonic stem cell (ES) like colonies. We termed such ES like cells as the culture-induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSC). CiPSCs from Mstn (-/-) MDSCs were phenotypically similar to ESCs, expressed high levels of Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and SSEA-1, maintained a normal karyotype. Furthermore, CiPSCs formed embryoid bodies and teratomas when injected into immunocompromised mice. In addition, CiPSCs differentiated into somatic cells of all three lineages. We further show that culturing in ES cell media, resulted in hypermethylation and downregulation of BMP2 in Mstn(-/-) MDSCs. Western blot further confirmed a down regulation of BMP2 signaling in Mstn (-/-) MDSCs in supportive of pluripotent reprogramming. Given that down regulation of BMP2 has been shown to induce pluripotency in cells, we propose that lack of myostatin epigenetically reprograms the MDSCs to become pluripotent stem cells. Thus, here we report the successful establishment of ES-like cells from adult stem cells of the non-germline origin under culture-induced conditions without introducing reprogramming genes.",,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Mstn protein, mouse)', '0 (Myostatin)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox2 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 10.,"KIT is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand stem cell factor (SCF) triggers homodimerization and activation of downstream effector pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation, homing, or differentiation. KIT-activating mutations are major oncogenic drivers in subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in mast cell leukemia, and in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The overexpression of SCF and/or wild-type (WT) KIT is also observed in a number of cancers, including 50% of AML and small cell lung cancer. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in these pathologies is, however, hampered by initial or acquired resistance following treatment. Using antibody phage display, we obtained two antibodies (2D1 and 3G1) specific for the most membrane proximal extracellular immunoglobulin domain (D5) of KIT, which is implicated in KIT homodimerization. Produced as single chain variable antibody fragments fused to the Fc fragment of a human IgG1, bivalent 2D1-Fc and 3G1-Fc inhibited KIT-dependent growth of leukemic cell lines expressing WT KIT (UT7/Epo) or constitutively active KIT mutants, including the TKI imatinib-resistant KIT D816V mutant (HMC1.2 cell line). In all models, either expressing WT KIT or mutated KIT, 2D1 and 3G1-Fc induced KIT internalization and sustained surface downregulation. However, interestingly, KIT degradation was only observed in leukemic cell lines with oncogenic KIT, a property likely to limit the toxicity of these antibodies in patients. These fully human antibody formats may represent therapeutic tools to target KIT signaling in leukemia or GIST, and to bypass TKI resistance of certain KIT mutants.",['P41 CA196276/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['NIHMS802345'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GAS2-Calpain2 axis is required for the growth of BCR-ABL(+) hematopoietic cells and chronic myeloid leukemia cells. However, the expression of GAS2 in acute leukemia patients remains unclear and what role GAS2-Calpain2 axis plays in these leukemic cells is not known yet. In this study, GAS2 was found to have significantly higher expression in 16 various leukemic cell lines than in control cells. Using THP-1 cells (from acute myeloid leukemia patient, AML) and Jurkat cells (from acute lymphoid leukemia patient, ALL) as models, we found that GAS2 silence led to elevated Calpain activity, decreased cellular growth, and inhibition of colony-forming cell (CFC) production; and these effects could be rescued by GAS2 re-expression. Moreover, GAS2 silence prevented tumor formation of THP-1 cells in nude mice. In both THP-1 and Jurkat cells, GAS2 interacted with Calpain2 rather than Calpain1. The dominant negative form of GAS2 (GAS2DN, GAS2Delta171-313) had similar effects on leukemic cells through the activation of Calpain. Importantly, Calpain2 silence abolished the proliferation inhibition induced by GAS2 targeting. We also found that GAS2 was aberrantly expressed and Calpain activity was decreased in clinical isolates from acute leukemia patients. Taken together, our results demonstrated the deregulation of GAS2 in both AML and ALL and the requirement of GAS2-Calpain2 axis for the growth of leukemic cells, which will help to understand the molecular pathogenesis of hematological malignancies and possibly to develop novel approaches to treat these deadly diseases.",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GAS2 protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.53 (CAPN2 protein, human)']",,"['(c) The Author 2015.

We investigated the role of autophagy, a controlled intracellular self-digestion, in the anti-leukemic action of statins. Treatment with low concentrations (</=6 microM) of statins, cholesterol depletion, and specific inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and protein farnesylation or geranylgeranylation, all inhibited proliferation of leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells without inducing overt cell death. Statins and agents that selectively reduce intracellular cholesterol levels, but not the inhibition of protein farnesylation or geranylgeranylation, induced autophagy in leukemic cells. The observed autophagic response was associated with the reduction of phosphorylated Akt levels in the lipid rafts, accompanied by a decrease in the activation of the main autophagy suppressor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its substrate ribosomal p70S6 kinase (p70S6K). No significant autophagy induction and downregulation of mTOR/p70S6K activation were observed in normal leukocytes. Autophagy suppression by bafilomycin A1 or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B induced apoptotic death in statin-treated leukemic cells, an effect attenuated by the addition of mevalonate or squalene, but not farnesylpyrophosphate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Therefore, while the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, protein farnesylation, and geranylgeranylation all contributed to anti-leukemic effects of statins, the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was solely responsible for the induction of cytoprotective autophagy. These data indicate that combined treatment with statins and autophagy inhibitors might be potentially useful in anti-leukemic therapy.",,"['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In response to BCR triggering, normal and malignant B cells secrete the chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 to attract accessory cells to the tissue microenvironment. We measured CCL3 and CCL4 serum concentrations in 102 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, investigated their prognostic impact and validated our findings in an independent cohort of 51 patient samples. We also tested CCL3 and CCL4 secretion by DLBCL cells, and the influence of BTK inhibitors on the secretion of these chemokines. High CCL3 (>/=40 pg/ml) serum concentrations correlated with higher international prognostic index, lactate dehydrogenase and beta2 microglobulin, as did CCL4 (>/=180 pg/ml) with advanced Ann Arbor stages. High CCL3 levels correlated with significantly shorter progression-free and overall survival. The in vitro studies demonstrated that activated B cell-like, but not germinal centre B cell-like DLBCL cells, secrete high levels of CCL3 and CCL4 after BCR triggering, which was exquisitely sensitive to BCR pathway inhibition. These findings support CCL3 and CCL4 protein concentrations as biomarkers for BCR pathway activation and prognosis in DLBCL.","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCL3 protein, human)', '0 (CCL4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,['NIHMS715814'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we found that MDSCs (CD33 + CD11b + HLA-DR(low/neg)) in bone marrow were significantly increased in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. MDSCs levels in newly diagnosed AML patients correlated well with extramedullary infiltration and plasma D-dimer levels. Remission rates in the MDSCs > 1500 group and MDSCs < 1500 group were 72.73 and 81.25 %, respectively. No significant differences were found between the two groups. MDSC levels in the complete remission group were significantly decreased after chemotherapy, while in the partial remission and non-remission groups, there were no significant differences. The level of MDSCs in the high minimal residual disease (MRD) group was significantly higher than that in the middle and low MRD groups. High levels of Wilms' Tumor-1 (WT-1) protein were strongly correlated with higher bone marrow MDSC levels. In conclusion, we report here a population of immunosuppressive monocytes in the bone marrow of patients with AML characterized by the CD33(high)CD11b + HLA-DR(low/neg) phenotype. These cells appear to impact the clinical course and prognosis of AML.

We conducted an exploratory analysis of sequential BMF data from two phase I studies of long-term treatment with the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor fedratinib in patients with myelofibrosis. METHODS: Bone marrow samples were obtained at baseline and after every six cycles (24 weeks) of daily fedratinib treatment. Fibrosis was centrally assessed by three independent haematopathologists, who were blinded to the patients' data, and graded according to European Consensus Myelofibrosis Grading Criteria. The analysis population comprised patients with a baseline BMF grade >/=1, and at least one post-baseline BMF grade assessment. Changes in BMF grade compared with baseline were classified as improvement (>/=1 grade reduction), stabilisation (no change in any baseline BMF grade <3) or worsening (>/=1 grade increase). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included in the analysis. A total of 153 bone marrow samples were analysed. Improvement or stabilisation of BMF from baseline was recorded in 15 of 18 (83%) evaluable patients at cycle 6 and in four of nine (44%) evaluable patients at cycle 30.

The JAK2(V617F) mutation leads to constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation and potentially leads to inhibition of Stathmin 1 activity via STAT3. In support of this hypothesis, we found that, in HEL JAK2(V617F) cells, ruxolitinib treatment decreased STAT3 and Stathmin 1 association, induced Stathmin 1 activation and microtubule instability. Silencing of Stathmin 1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and clonal growth, and increased apoptosis induced by ruxolitinib. Stathmin 1 silencing also prevented ruxolitinib-induced microtubule instability. To phenocopy the effect of Stathmin 1 inhibition, cells were treated with paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug, in association or not with ruxolitinib; combined treatment significantly increased apoptosis, when compared to monotherapy. Notably, Stathmin 1 mRNA levels were highly expressed in CD34(+) cells from primary myelofibrosis patients. We then proposed that an undesired effect of ruxolitinib treatment may constitute Stathmin 1 activation and microtubule instability in JAK2(V617F) cells.

Cis-regulatory elements play an important role in gene regulation, with mutations in these elements potentially resulting in changes to the expression of linked genes. The recent discoveries of recurrent TERT promoter mutations in melanoma, and recurrent mutations that create a super-enhancer regulating TAL1 expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), have sparked significant interest in the search for other somatic cis-regulatory mutations driving cancer development. In this review, we look more closely at the TERT promoter and TAL1 enhancer alterations and use these examples to ask whether other cis-regulatory mutations may play a role in cancer susceptibility. In doing so, we make observations from the data emerging from recent research in this field, and describe the experimental and analytical approaches which could be adopted in the hope of better uncovering the true functional significance of somatic cis-regulatory mutations in cancer.",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, since there is no study of noise-resistance performance of these indices in the literature, there is no guideline for determining the best clustering in noisy data sets, especially microarray data sets. In this paper, we propose a generalized parametric validity (GPV) index which employs two tunable parameters alpha and beta to control the proportions of objects being considered to calculate the dissimilarities. The greatest advantage of the proposed GPV index is its noise-resistance ability, which results from the flexibility of tuning the parameters. Several rules are set to guide the selection of parameter values. To illustrate the noise-resistance performance of the proposed index, we evaluate the GPV index for assessing five clustering algorithms in two gene expression data simulation models with different noise levels and compare the ability of determining the number of clusters with eight existing indices. We also test the GPV in three groups of real gene expression data sets. The experimental results suggest that the proposed GPV index has superior noise-resistance ability and provides fairly accurate judgements.",['RP-PG-0310-1004/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, its relevance for functional outcome and its role as outcome predictor remains uncertain. We evaluated the relationship of various early inflammatory parameters regarding functional outcome according to the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) at discharge (primary objective) and six months after aSAH. PATIENTS: A total of 81 patients (63% female) with a mean age of 53.8 +/- 13.2 years were included. METHODS: At admission clinical data and various inflammatory parameters in serum and - wherever applicable - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients after aSAH were assessed. Outcome was evaluated according to dichotomized mRS at discharge and six months after aSAH (unfavorable outcome: mRS 3-6). Univariate and thereafter multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using SAS 9.2. RESULTS: Elevated levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in serum and CSF were related to unfavorable outcome at discharge (p<0.05; univariate analyses). IL-6 remains the only parameter relevant for outcome applying a multivariate model including the relevant baseline characteristics. Six months after aSAH no significant correlation was found regarding the outcome, most likely due to the high drop-out rate (27%). A pronounced rise of LIF serum and CSF levels after aSAH was observed. CONCLUSION: Higher early IL-6 serum levels after aSAH are associated with poor outcome at discharge. In addition, involvement of LIF in the early inflammatory reaction after aSAH has been demonstrated.",,"['0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2015 Sep 10.,"To clarify whether karyotype aberrations (KA) involving regions not covered by the standard fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel have independent prognostic relevance, we evaluated KA by conventional cytogenetics in a learning cohort (LC; n = 166) and a validation cohort (VC; n = 250) of untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. In the VC, novel mitogens were used to improve metaphase generation and TP53, NOTCH1, and SF3B1 mutations were assessed. KA undetected by FISH were found in 35 and 35% of the cases in the LC and VC, respectively. In addition to FISH, KA allowed reclassification of 23 and 26% of cases in the LC and VC, respectively, into a higher cytogenetic risk group. By multivariate analysis, both in the LC and VC, KA other than isolated 13q deletion correlated with a shorter time to first treatment (TFT; P < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively), while a complex karyotype predicted a worse overall survival (OS, P = 0.015 and 0.010, respectively). In the VC, where a comprehensive biologic assessment was performed, a shorter TFT was also predicted by stage (P < 0.001), IGHV mutational status (P = 0.05), and del(17p)/TP53 mutations (P = 0.033) while stage (P = 0.023) and del(17p)/TP53 mutations (P = 0.024) independently predicted a shorter OS. FISH results did not independently impact on TFT and OS, in the LC and VC cohorts; this was also the case for NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations in the VC.

Epub 2015 Sep 10.,"In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), deletion of the short arm of chromosome 12 (del(12p)) is usually a small abnormality, rarely detected as a single aberration by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) of bone marrow metaphases. Del(12p) has been described in 0.6 to 5% of MDS patients at initial diagnosis and is associated with a good to intermediate prognosis as a sole anomaly according to current scoring systems. Here, we present the results of a systematic del(12p) testing in a German prospective diagnostic study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01355913) on 367 MDS patients in whom CD34+ peripheral blood cells were analysed for the presence of del(12p) by sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. A cohort of 2,902 previously published MDS patients diagnosed by CBA served as control. We demonstrate that, using a sensitive FISH technique, 12p deletion occurs significantly more frequently in MDS than previously described (7.6% by CD34+ PB-FISH vs. 1.6% by CBA, P < 0.001) and is often associated with other aberrations (93% by CD34+ PB-FISH vs. 60% by CBA). Additionally, the detection rate can be increased by repeated analyses in a patient over time which is important for the patient s prognosis to distinguish a sole anomaly from double or complex aberrations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to screen for 12p deletions with a suitable probe for ETV6/TEL in 12p13. Our data suggest that the supplement of a probe for the detection of a 12p deletion to common FISH probe panels helps to avoid missing a del(12p), especially as part of more complex aberrations.",,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'Chromosome 12p deletion']",,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01355913'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 18.,"Active forms of vitamin D regulate the expression of multiple genes that play essential roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, cell differentiation, and the immune system via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Many vitamin D analogs have been synthesized for clinical use in the treatment of type I rickets, osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, psoriasis, leukemia, and breast cancer. We have constructed two fusion proteins containing split-luciferase and the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the VDR designated as LucN-LBD-LucC and LucC-LBD-LucN. Remarkably, the LucC-LBD-LucN, which has the C-terminal domain of luciferase at the N-terminus of the fusion protein, was a significantly better biosensor than LucN-LBD-LucC. Addition of the VDR agonists to COS-7 cells expressing LucC-LBD-LucN dramatically reduced luciferase activity. In contrast, the VDR antagonist significantly increased the chimeric luciferase activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Our results on chimeric luciferases containing the LBDs of mutant VDRs derived from patients with vitamin D-dependent type II rickets indicated that our system could detect a conformational change of the LBD of the VDR likely based on a positional change of the helix 12, which occurs upon ligand binding. This novel system to detect and discriminate between VDR agonists and antagonists could be useful for the screening and identification of chemical compounds that bind to normal or mutant VDRs with high affinity.",,"['0 (25-dehydro-1alpha-hydroxy-24,24-dimethylvitamin D3-26,23-lactone)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not using ionizing radiation is a major advantage of pediatric whole-body MRI. Coronal and sagittal short tau inversion recovery imaging is most commonly used as the fundamental whole-body MRI protocol. Diffusion-weighted imaging and Dixon-based imaging, which has been recently incorporated into whole-body MRI, are promising pulse sequences, particularly for pediatric oncology. Other pulse sequences may be added to increase diagnostic capability of whole-body MRI. Of importance, the overall whole-body MRI examination time should be less than 30-60 minutes in children, regardless of the imaging protocol.

Pilot studies suggest that outpatient management following chemotherapy might be safe and could reduce costs for these patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare safety, resource utilization, infections, and costs between adults discharged early following AML or MDS induction or salvage chemotherapy and inpatient controls. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, phase 2, single-center study conducted at the University of Washington Medical Center. Over a 43-month period (January 1, 2011, through July 31, 2014), 178 adults receiving intensive AML or MDS chemotherapy were enrolled. After completion of chemotherapy, 107 patients met predesignated medical and logistical criteria for early discharge, while 29 met medical criteria only and served as inpatient controls. INTERVENTIONS: Early-discharge patients were released from the hospital at the completion of chemotherapy, and supportive care was provided in the outpatient setting until blood cell count recovery (median, 21 days; range, 2-45 days). Controls received inpatient supportive care (median, 16 days; range, 3-42 days). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We analyzed differences in early mortality, resource utilization including intensive care unit (ICU) days, transfusions per study day, and use of intravenous (IV) antibiotics per study day), numbers of infections, and total and inpatient charges per study day among early-discharge patients vs controls. RESULTS: Four of the 107 early-discharge patients and none of the 29 control patients died within 30 days of enrollment (P=.58). Nine early-discharge patients (8%) but no controls required ICU-level care (P=.20). No differences were noted in the median daily number of transfused red blood cell units (0.27 vs 0.29; P=.55) or number of transfused platelet units (0.26 vs 0.29; P=.31). Early-discharge patients had more positive blood cultures (37 [35%] vs 4 [14%]; P=.04) but required fewer IV antibiotic days per study day (0.48 vs 0.71; P=.01). Overall, daily charges among early-discharge patients were significantly lower than for inpatients (median, $3840 vs $5852; P<.001) despite increased charges per inpatient day when readmitted (median, $7405 vs $5852; P<.001).

Epub 2015 Sep 9.,"Several prodrugs of the naturally occurring combretastatins have undergone extensive clinical evaluation as vascular targeting agents (VTAs). Their increased selectivity toward endothelial cells together with their innate ability to rapidly induce vascular shutdown and inhibit tumor growth at doses up to 10-fold less than the maximum tolerated dose led to the clinical evaluation of combretastatins as VTAs. Tubulin is well established as the molecular target of the combretastatins and the vast majority of its synthetic derivatives. Furthermore, tubulin is a highly validated molecular target of many direct anticancer agents routinely used as front-line chemotherapeutics. The unique vascular targeting properties of the combretastatins have somewhat overshadowed their development as direct anticancer agents and the delineation of the various cell death pathways and anticancer properties associated with such chemotherapeutics. Moreover, the ongoing clinical trial of OXi4503 (combretastatin-A1 diphosphate) together with preliminary preclinical evaluation for the treatment of refractory acute myelogenous leukemia has successfully highlighted both the indirect and direct anticancer properties of combretastatins. In this review, we discuss the development of the combretastatins from nature to the clinic. The various mechanisms underlying combretastatin-induced cell cycle arrest, mitotic catastrophe, cell death, and survival are also reviewed in an attempt to further enhance the clinical prospects of this unique class of VTAs.",,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '2222ATS339 (combretastatin A-1)', 'I5590ES2QZ (fosbretabulin)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MD Anderson prognostic score (MDAPS) has been the most useful for CMML risk assessment. Due to recent emergence of CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) and Mayo prognostic model, we compared the three scores. One hundred forty-six CMML patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed to assess prognostic impact on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) of the variables composing the scores and all items showed prognostic value on OS with the exception of the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. Regarding LFS, only CPSS variables, bone marrow blast >/=10% and an absolute monocyte count >10x10(9)/L had an impact. When the scores were applied, all showed an impact on OS and retained their significance in multivariate analysis. By using ROC curves and C-index, CPSS showed a slightly better predictive value for mortality and leukemia transformation. Variables composing the three indexes were compared in multivariate analysis and only CPSS parameters and platelets<100x10(9)/L retained their significance. Based on these findings, by adding platelet count to CPSS, a new score was implemented (CPSS-P) showing the best risk prediction capability in our series. This study reinforces the validity of the tested scores.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 20 to 30 per cent patients develop resistance to imatinib and fail imatinib treatment. One of the mechanisms proposed is varying expression levels of the drug transporters. This study was aimed to determine the expression levels of imatinib transporter genes (OCT1, ABCB1, ABCG2) in CML patients and to correlate these levels with molecular response. METHODS: Sixty three CML chronic phase patients who were on 400 mg/day imatinib for more than two years were considered for gene expression analysis study for OCT1, ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes. These were divided into responders and non-responders. The relative transcript expression levels of the three genes were compared between these two categories. The association between the expression values of these three genes was also determined. RESULTS: No significant difference in the expression levels of OCT1, ABCB1 and ABCG2 was found between the two categories. The median transcript expression levels of OCT1, ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes in responders were 26.54, 10.78 and 0.64 versus 33.48, 7.09 and 0.53 in non-responders, respectively. A positive association was observed between the expression of the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporter genes (r=0.407, P<0.05) while no association was observed between the expression of either of the ABC transporter genes with the OCT1 gene. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that the mRNA expression levels of imatinib transporter genes were not correlated with molecular response in CML patients.

Epub 2015 Jul 28.,"BACKGROUND: The Oncotyrol - Center for Personalized Cancer Medicine is an international and interdisciplinary alliance combining research and commercial competencies to accelerate the development, evaluation and translation of personalized healthcare strategies in cancer. The philosophy of Oncotyrol is to collaborate with relevant stakeholders and advance knowledge ""from bench to bedside to population and back"". Oncotyrol is funded through the COMET Excellence Program by the Austrian government via the national Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). This article focuses on the role of health technology assessment (HTA) and outcomes research in personalized cancer medicine in the context of Oncotyrol. METHODS: Oncotyrol, which currently comprises approximately 20 individual projects, has four research areas: Area 1: Biomarker and Drug Target Identification; Area 2: Assay Development and Drug Screening; Area 3: Innovative Therapies; Area 4: Health Technology Assessment and Bioinformatics. Area 4 translates the results from Areas 1 to 3 to populations and society and reports them back to Area 3 to inform clinical studies and guidelines, and to Areas 1 and 2 to guide further research and development. RESULTS: In a series of international expert workshops, the Oncotyrol International Expert Task Force for Personalized Cancer Medicine developed the Methodological Framework for Early Health Technology Assessment and Decision Modeling in Cancer and practical guidelines in this field. Further projects included applications in the fields of sequential treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness evaluation of prostate cancer screening, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multiple cervical cancer screening strategies, and benefits and cost-effectiveness of genomic test-based treatment strategies in breast cancer. CONCLUSION: An interdisciplinary setting as generated in Oncotyrol provides unique opportunities such as systematically coordinating lab and bench research, product development, clinical studies and decision science/HTA and transparent joint planning of research and development with a partnership of researchers, manufacturers and health policy decision makers. However, generating a joint research and legal framework with numerous partners from different sectors can be challenging, particularly in the starting period of such an endeavor. The journey to translational personalized medicine through multidisciplinary collaborations may still be long and difficult, but it is evident that it must be continued to turn vision into reality.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015.

In this study, we hypothesized that CDA polymorphisms were associated with the AraC metabolism for AML treatment and/or related clinical phenotypes. We analyzed 16 polymorphisms of CDA among 50 normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) patients, 45 abnormal karyotype AML (AK-AML) patients and 241 normal controls (NC). Several polymorphisms and haplotypes, rs532545, rs2072671, rs471760, rs4655226, rs818194 and CDA-ht3, were found to have a strong correlation with NK-AML compared with NC and these polymorphisms also revealed strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. Among them, rs2072671 (79A>C), which is located in a coding region and the resultant amino acid change K27Q, showed significant associations with NK-AML compared with NC (P=0.009 and odds ratio=2.44 in the dominant model). The AC and CC genotypes of rs2072671 (79A>C) were significantly correlated with shorter overall survival rates (P=0.03, hazard ratio=1.84) and first complete remission duration (P=0.007, hazard ratio=3.24) compared with the AA genotype in the NK-AML patients.

Vav was first identified in an NIH3T3 screen for oncogenes. Although the oncogenic form of Vav1 identified in the screen has not been detected in clinical human tumors, its wild-type form has recently been implicated in mammalian malignancies, including neuroblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic, lung and breast cancers, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, it was recently identified as a mutated gene in human cancers of various origins. However, the activity and contribution to cancer of these Vav1 mutants is still unclear.

To date, the drug of choice for the treatment of ALL is methotrexate, a drug associated with a high risk of adverse reactions (ADRs). The xanthine oxidase (XO) polymorphisms, 1936A>G and 2107A>G, as well as the polymorphic variants derived from ATP-binding cassette transporter gene subfamilies, ABCB1 and ABCC5, of drug resistant codifying genes, are implicated as precursors of drug-related neurologic, hepatic, and renal toxicities. Our aim was to determine whether the mentioned polymorphisms are risk or protective factors for the development of adverse reactions by methotrexate in our pediatric population with ALL. METHODS: A total of 35 Mexican children from Centro Estatal de Cancerologia-Durango, Mexico, with ALL and the previously noted polymorphisms as determined qPCR were studied. At the same time, a 12-month drug monitoring program was conducted in accordance with WHO-PAHO guidelines for pharmacovigilance. RESULTS: The ABCB11936A>G and 2107A>G and ABCC5 3414+434A>C polymorphisms were not associated with methotrexate ADRs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1 1236C>T (OR 0.19, 95% CI: 0.03-0.9, p<0.05) and ABCC5 3933+313T>C (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.027-0.58, p<0.05) were associated with methotrexate ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: SNPs 1236C>T of ABCB1 and ABCC5 3933+313T>C are not associated with the development of typical ADRs by methotrexate, rather, they showed a protective factor for myelosuppression in the studied sick population.",,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC5 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1229-8257'],,,,,,,,

Single-cell PCR analysis and next-generation immuno-sequencing identified IGH-defined clones. In 23% (18/79) of cases whose clones carried unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes (U-CLL), IGH rearrangements were bialleic with one productive (P) and one non-productive (NP) allele. Two U-CLL were biclonal, each clone being monoallelic (P). In 119 IGHV-mutated (M-CLL) cases, one had biallelic rearrangements in their CLL (P/NP) and five had 2-4 distinct clones. Allelic exclusion was maintained in all B-clones analyzed. Based on single-cell PCR analysis, 5/11 partner clones (45%) reached levels of >5x10(9) cells/L, suggesting second CLL clones. Partner clones persisted over years. Conventional IGH characterization and next-generation sequencing of 13 CLL, 3 multiple myeloma, 2 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and 3 age-matched healthy donors consistently identified the same rearranged IGH sequences. Most multiple clones occurred in M-CLL, perhaps indicative of weak clonal dominance, thereby associating with a good prognosis. In contrast, biallelic CLL occurred primarily in U-CLL thus being associated with poor prognosis. Extending beyond intra-clonal diversity, molecular analysis of clonal evolution and apparent subclones in CLL may also reflect inter-clonal diversity.",,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 8.,"Poria cocos Wolf., which belongs to the Polyporaceae family, has been widely used as an Oriental traditional herbal medicine for centuries. Its sclerotium has been reported to possess a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, including free-radical scavenging, anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induction by P. cocos in human cancer cells are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic potential of an ethanol extract of P. cocos sclerotium (EEPC) in human leukemia U937 cells in vitro. We found that EEPC induced anti-proliferative effects in U937 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which was due to apoptotic induction, as evident from morphological changes and flow cytometric assays. EEPC-induced apoptosis of U937 cells was associated with an increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and a decrease in the expression of an inhibitor of the apoptosis family of proteins. The events were accompanied by activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, suggesting the involvement of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascades. In addition, the overexpression of Bcl-2 caused a significant attenuation of EEPC-induced caspase activation, degradation of PARP, and the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and thereby reversed EEPC-induced cell apoptosis and growth inhibition. Collectively, these data provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying EEPC-induced apoptosis in U937 cells, suggesting that EEPC may be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Solvents)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial case presented with occipital lobe abscess and was found on biopsy to have organisms consistent with Bacillus species. Within 1 week, a second patient died of fulminant brain swelling and hemorrhage. Neuropathologic autopsy and culture revealed B. cereus; hospital infection control and public health officials were notified. Three more patients died within the subsequent 9 months (2 patients had rapid massive hemorrhage and many bacilli reminiscent of Bacillus anthracis infection, and 1 patient had sparse bacilli, petechial hemorrhages, and border zone infarcts). Blood cultures yielded positive results in 3 of 5 cases. A possible route of infection was hematogenous dissemination via GI mucosal breaches (GI symptoms occurred in 3 of 5 cases, and postmortem GI ulceration was found in 3 of 4 cases). Bacilli were seen in 2 of 3 GI ulcerations. Epidemiologic work-up, including a site visit conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not identify a clear common source but suggested the possibility of bananas as a food source.

Epub 2015 Sep 9.,"BACKGROUND: BRAF V600E is the genetic lesion underlying hairy-cell leukemia. We assessed the safety and activity of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with hairy-cell leukemia that had relapsed after treatment with a purine analogue or who had disease that was refractory to purine analogues. METHODS: We conducted two phase 2, single-group, multicenter studies of vemurafenib (at a dose of 960 mg twice daily)--one in Italy and one in the United States. The therapy was administered for a median of 16 weeks in the Italian study and 18 weeks in the U.S. study. Primary end points were the complete response rate (in the Italian trial) and the overall response rate (in the U.S. trial). Enrollment was completed (28 patients) in the Italian trial in April 2013 and is still open (26 of 36 planned patients) in the U.S. trial. RESULTS: The overall response rates were 96% (25 of 26 patients who could be evaluated) after a median of 8 weeks in the Italian study and 100% (24 of 24) after a median of 12 weeks in the U.S. study. The rates of complete response were 35% (9 of 26 patients) and 42% (10 of 24) in the two trials, respectively. In the Italian trial, after a median follow-up of 23 months, the median relapse-free survival was 19 months among patients with a complete response and 6 months among those with a partial response; the median treatment-free survival was 25 months and 18 months, respectively. In the U.S. trial, at 1 year, the progression-free survival rate was 73% and the overall survival rate was 91%. Drug-related adverse events were usually of grade 1 or 2, and the events most frequently leading to dose reductions were rash and arthralgia or arthritis. Secondary cutaneous tumors (treated with simple excision) developed in 7 of 50 patients. The frequent persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a resistance mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.

Epub 2015 Sep 8.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide malignancy of high incidence and mortality. At present, there is a lack of effective drugs against CRC. The Bcell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein family members are considered to be closely associated with tumorigenesis and the chemoresistance of CRC. As a novel gossypol derivative targeting antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl2 family, apogossypolone (ApoG2) exhibits antitumor properties in various cancer types, although its effects against CRC remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the cytotoxicity of ApoG2 in vitro on CRC cells was investigated, with the aim of elucidating the underlying mechanism. Using an MTT assay, ApoG2 was revealed to inhibit the growth of the HT29, SW480 and HCT116 CRC cell lines in a dose and a timedependent manner. Hoechst staining revealed that ApoG2 induced CRC cell apoptosis, marked by morphological changes, including cell shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation. Flow cytometric analysis also detected a higher apoptotic ratio following treatment with ApoG2. The ratio was dependent upon the concentration of ApoG2, which the cells were exposed to, and the duration of the exposure. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that ApoG2 treatment led to the downregulation of the protein expression of Mcl1, and the interruption of the binding of Mcl1 to the protein Bax. Furthermore, treatment with ApoG2 led to the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and the activation of caspases 3 and 7. The present study revealed that ApoG2 inhibited the proliferation of the CRC cell lines through mitochondrial signaling pathwaydependent apoptosis, which may be associated with the disruption of the function of the Mcl1 protein by ApoG2.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (apogossypolone)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most modern investigations support a genetic rather than an environmental explanation. Clinically, most pedigrees of families with familial hematologic malignancies demonstrate age of onset anticipation (ie, diagnosis at an earlier age in successive generations). The cause of anticipation is clear in some familial neurologic disorders (eg, trinucleotide repeat expansion in Huntington disease) but unclear in familial hematologic malignancies. In preparation for molecular studies on familial clustering of hematologic malignancies, we collected pedigrees on 738 families. In these families, we observed anticipation in those with familial multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Here we present preliminary data on 26 families with both multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma in their pedigrees, and demonstrate strong evidence for anticipation and predominantly male transmission of these neoplasms. We encourage all health care personnel to ask patients about their family's medical history, to take careful family histories from individuals with uncommon illnesses, and to refer families with clustering of such illnesses for investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 9.,"OBJECTIVES: The D-index and the L-index, calculated as the area over the neutrophil and lymphocyte curves, respectively, reflect both the intensity and duration of cytopenia. We, retrospectively, investigated the impact of these indexes on pulmonary infection (PI) in induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). METHODS: We included 92 patients (ALL 83, LBL 9) from two institutions. We calculated the D-index and cumulative D-index until the development of PI (c-D-index), which enables real-time risk assessment for infection. We also calculated the L-index (35), defined as the area over the lymphocyte curve during lymphopenia (<700/microl) until day 35 and the cumulative-L-index until the development of PI (c-L-index). RESULTS: Eight patients developed PI on day 20 (median). Two patients were strongly suspected to have bacterial pneumonia, and the others were suspected to have pulmonary fungal infection. The D-index and the L-index (35) in patients with PI were higher than those in patients without PI (7230 +/- 4734 vs. 4519 +/- 3416, P = 0.041 and 15 458 +/- 5243 vs. 8920 +/- 5901, P = 0.018), while the c-D-index and the c-L-index were not significantly different. Although the c-L-index did not have predictive value for PI, c-D-index, when treated as a dichotomous variable with a cutoff value of 5589 as determined by a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, showed a significant difference between two groups (P = 0.045). This association became clearer when we focused on suspected pulmonary fungal infection. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In induction chemotherapy for ALL/LBL, c-D-index with a cutoff value of 5589 might have predictive value for the development of PI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Recurrent somatic mutations have been identified in about 90% of patients with myeloid neoplasms with myelodysplasia, involving genes of RNA splicing, DNA methylation, histone modification, transcription regulation, DNA repair, signal transduction, and cohesin complex. Somatic mutations are acquired in a linear manner in a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell, resulting in a growth advantage at the stem cell level and in defective differentiation and maturation of hematopoietic precursors. Recently, evidence has been provided of age-related hematopoietic clones, driven by mutations of genes recurrently mutated in myeloid neoplasms. These hematopoietic clones may represent either premalignant clones with the potential to progress to myeloid neoplasm or small malignant clones at a preclinical stage. SUMMARY: The available evidence clearly indicates that greater understanding of the molecular basis of myeloid neoplasms with myelodysplasia has relevant implications in the classification of these disorders, as well as in predicting disease risk and response to specific treatment modalities, and may open avenues of research leading to novel therapeutic options and personalized treatment in the individual patient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: HMT has been shown to induce responses in MDS and AML, and azacitidine (Vidaza, Celgene) has been shown to prolong survival in higher-risk MDS. Recent studies have supported the idea that disease stability may also be a treatment goal, whereas treatment interruption in responding patients is associated with rapid disease relapse and death. In AML, a modest but significant survival advantage has been shown for HMT by censoring patients at the time of subsequent AML therapy, but the major limitation remains the short duration of responses. Unfortunately, some of the strategies to overcome these limitations have failed, including the combination of HMT to histone-deacetylase inhibitors, which has not definitively shown to significantly prolong survival. Molecules interfering with other pathways impacting the survival and proliferation of blasts, used alone or in combination, including guadecitabine, selinexor, or inhibitors of IDH2 mutations, are more promising approaches. SUMMARY: Hypomethylating drugs are the first successful treatment for elderly patients with higher-risk MDS and are effective for some AML subtypes. Translational studies will hopefully identify patients with a favorable profile of response to these drugs, and help to identify newer targets for combination treatments.",,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While these medications are generally well tolerated, cutaneous reactions occur frequently and can present a management challenge. We describe a newly recognized skin reaction to dasatinib and nilotinib and extend it to the newer agent ponatinib. OBSERVATIONS: Nine patients developed varying degrees of a clinically and histopathologically lichenoid exanthem comprised of erythematous, predominately follicular papules with scale and alopecia. The pattern is reminiscent of the scarring and nonscarring alopecia of follicular lichen planus/lichen planopilaris (LPP) with keratosis pilaris-like LPP--the rare Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lassueur syndrome. Importantly, the accompanying pruritus can be severe enough to result in discontinuation of therapy.

However, there are no data available about the prognostic value of MK expression in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: In this study, MK mRNA expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 120 childhood ALL and 30 healthy volunteers. Patients were dichotomized at the median value and divided into two groups: MK(low) group and MK(high) group. RESULTS: MK(high) patients had higher white blood cell counts, higher peripheral blood blasts percentages, and higher minimal residual disease levels than MK(low) patients. Moreover, the MK gene was expressed significantly higher in patients with relapsed ALL than in patients who maintained complete remission or at diagnosis. MK(high) patients harbored inferior relapse-free survival (RFS, P = 0.047) and overall survival (OS, P = 0.022) than MK(low) patients, and high expression of MK was found to be independently predictive of inferior OS (P = 0.032) but not RFS (P = 0.077) in the overall cohort. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: MK high expression is an independent adverse prognostic factor in childhood ALL. Its level may be incorporated into an improved risk classification system for ALL and suggest the need of alternative regimens.",,"['0 (MDK protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '137497-38-2 (Midkine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intraocular pressure of the rats was elevated to 110 mmHg for 1 h by infusing the anterior chamber with normal saline. The retinal tissues were obtained 12 h, 24 h, and 2, 3 and 7 days after termination of the ocular hypertension. Hematoxylin and eosin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were performed to assess the morphological changes and the apoptosis of retinal cells, respectively. Quantification of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was performed using fluorogold retrograde (FG) staining. The expression levels of LIF, LIF receptor (LIFR), signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), phosphorylated STAT3 (PSTAT3), Akt, phosphorylatedAkt (PAkt), extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) and phosphorylated ERK (PERK) were determined at different timepoints following acute ocular hypertension using western blot analysis. Reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction was performned to detect the mRNA expression levels of LIF and LIFR. The results revealed that 12 h, 24 h, 2, 3 and 7 days after reperfusion, the thickness of the inner nuclear layer and the inner plexiform layer was decreased, with a significant reduction in the number of RGCs, as determined using TUNEL and FG staining. The expression levels of LIF and LIFR were increased following acute ocular hypertension. At 12 h postretinal reperfusion, the expression levels of PSTAT3 and PAkt were significantly upregulated, while the expression of PERK was decreased. The changes in the expression levels of LIF and LIFR suggested that LIF may be important in the process of degeneration/protection following retinal ischemia induced by acute ocular hypertension, via activation of the Janus kinase/STAT and Akt signaling pathways.",,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, none of the members of this family has ever been studied in hematological malignancies. Based on our preliminary results regarding the differential mRNA expression of several KLK genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) compared to healthy blood donors, we decided to study the diagnostic and prognostic potential of KLK14 mRNA expression in CLL. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from 69 CLL patients and 31 non-leukemic blood donors. After reverse transcription of poly(A)-RNA, KLK14 mRNA levels were quantified using a sensitive and accurate quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methodology. RESULTS: According to ROC analysis, KLK14 mRNA overexpression successfully discriminated CLL patients from normal population (area under the curve [AUC] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-0.95, p<0.001). Moreover, although not clearly related to clinical staging or other prognostic factors including IGHV mutational status and CD38 expression, strong KLK14 mRNA expression was shown to predict reduced overall survival of CLL patients (p=0.026) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

There is strong evidence that specific chromosomal translocations are a key element in this transformation process. Our studies focus on understanding the developmental mechanism by which a normal stem or progenitor cell transforms into leukemia. Here we used engineered nucleases to induce simultaneous specific double strand breaks in the MLL gene and two different known translocation partners (AF4 and AF9), which resulted in specific chromosomal translocations in K562 cells as well as primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The initiation of a specific MLL translocation in a small number of HSPCs likely mimics the leukemia-initiating event that occurs in patients. In our studies, the creation of specific MLL translocations in CD34+ cells was not sufficient to transform cells in vitro. Rather, a variety of fates was observed for translocation positive cells including cell loss over time, a transient proliferative advantage followed by loss of the clone, or a persistent proliferative advantage. These studies highlight the application of genome engineering tools in primary human HSPCs to induce and prospectively study the consequences of initiating translocation events in leukemia pathogenesis.",['R01 CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we describe the case of a 2-year-old boy who presented with bone pain and was found to have pancytopenia. Bone marrow examination showed morphologic and immunophenotypic findings typical of APL, but conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed no evidence of RARA rearrangements. The only cytogenetic abnormality found was a small insertion in 7q, and three copies of RUNX1T1. Gene sequencing results became available after initiating therapy but were not informative. We describe the rarity of such cases and discuss how the typical morphologic and immunophenotypic findings of APL, coupled with the definite absence of RARA rearrangement (by FISH and RT-PCR), present a diagnostic and classification dilemma, raising the possibility of an unknown alternative mechanism for the leukemogenesis and maturation arrest seen in other APL variants. The diagnostic challenges and urgent management issues this unusual case raises may justify including it, along with similar cases, in a separate subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in future classifications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One month after starting chemotherapy with chlorambucil and prednisone she presented superficial erythematous plaques on the anterior side of the left leg. Three weeks later erythematous painless deep nodules appeared on the left popliteal fossa and on the left thigh. Cutaneous biopsy revealed granulomatous panniculitis without caseation necrosis or vasculitis. Polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed positivity in the skin. The final diagnosis was reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB) induced by deep immunosuppression associated with chemotherapy and haematological disease. Tuberculous granulomatous panniculitis without vasculitis is a rare presentation of cutaneous TB and may be part of the heterogeneous histopathologic spectrum of erythema induratum of Bazin (nodular vasculitis).

Epub 2015 Sep 8.,"To analyze the influence of distinct combinations of molecular aberrations on outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), a retrospective registry analysis was performed on 702 adults undergoing HSCT in first complete remission (CR). Patients were grouped according to presence or absence of NPM1 mutations (NPM1(mut)) and FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD). Double-negative patients were evaluated for mutations of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha gene (CEBPalpha). The influence of genotypes on relapse, non-relapse mortality, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS), and a prognostic classification combining NPM1/FLT3-ITD profile and classical risk factors were calculated. Two-year OS from HSCT was 81 +/- 5% in NPM1(mut)/FLT3(wt), 75 +/- 3% in NPM1(wt)/FLT3(wt), 66 +/- 3% in NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD, and 54 +/- 7% in NPM1(wt)/FLT3-ITD (P = .003). Analysis of CEBPalpha among patients with NPM1(wt)/FLT3(wt) revealed excellent results both in patients with CEBPalpha(mut) and with a triple negative genotype (2-year OS: 100%/77 +/- 3%).

Therefore, the relevance of the polymorphism IDH1G105 (IDH1105(GGT) minor allele) was evaluated in the context of concomitant molecular mutations in a cohort of 507 AML cases with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. In addition, a cohort of 475 healthy controls was analyzed for this polymorphism. IDH1105(GGT) minor allele was found in 10 % of AML patients and 9 % of healthy controls. While no differences were seen with regard to cytomorphology or cytogenetics, immunophenotyping revealed significantly reduced expression of the progenitor marker CD34 in AML cases harboring IDH1105(GGT) minor allele. Cases with IDH1105(GGT) minor allele as compared to those with the IDH1105(GGC) major allele had significantly longer event-free survival (EFS) (median 16 vs 11 months, p = 0.013) which was most pronounced in the age group >60 years (median 14 vs 9 months, p = 0.007) and in the NPM1 mutated/FLT3-ITD/FLT3wt ratio <0.5 group (median 61 vs 13 months, p = 0.012).

Epub 2015 Sep 8.,"OBJECTIVE: We describe myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-associated systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (SIADs), their treatments and outcomes and the impact of SIADs on overall survival in a French multicentre retrospective study. METHODS: In this study, 123 patients with MDS and SIADs were analysed. RESULTS: Mean age was 70 years (s.d. 13) and the male:female ratio was 2. The SIADs were systemic vasculitis in 39 (32%) cases, CTD in 31 (25%) cases, inflammatory arthritis in 28 (23%) cases, a neutrophilic disorder in 12 (10%) cases and unclassified in 13 cases (11%). The SIADs fulfilled the usual classification criteria in 75 (66%) cases, while complete criteria were not reached in 21 (19%) cases. A significant association was shown between chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and systemic vasculitis (P = 0.0024). One hundred and eighteen (96%) SIAD patients were treated (91% with steroids), with an 83% response to first-line treatment, including 80% for steroids alone. A second-line treatment for SIADs was required for steroid dependence or relapse in 48% of cases. The effect of MDS treatment on SIADs could be assessed in 11 patients treated with azacytidine and SIAD response was achieved in 9/11 (80%) and 6/11 (55%) patients at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Compared with 665 MDS/CMML patients without SIADs, MDS/CMML patients with SIADs were younger (P < 0.01), male (P = 0.03), less often had refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (P < 0.01), more often had a poor karyotype (16% vs 11%, P = 0.04) and less frequently belonged to low and intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System categories, but no survival difference was seen between patients with MDS-associated SIADs and without SIADs (P = 0.5). CONCLUSION: The spectrum of SIADs associated to MDS is heterogeneous, steroid sensitive, but often steroid dependent.",,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",['Acta Haematol. 2016;136(2):108-17.

Epub 2015 Sep 8.,"PURPOSE: Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is usually CD25(+) and rapidly fatal. Anti-CD25 recombinant immunotoxin LMB-2 had phase I activity limited by immunogenicity and rapid growth. To prevent antidrug antibodies and leukemic progression between cycles, a phase II trial was performed with LMB-2 after cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ATL patients received cyclophosphamide and fludarabine days 1 to 3 and 2 weeks later began up to 6 cycles at 3-week intervals of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine days 1 to 3 followed by LMB-2 30-40 mug/kg i.v. days 3, 5, and 7. Three different dose levels of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine were used, 20+200 (n = 3), 25+250 (n = 12), and 30+300 mg/m(2) (n = 2). RESULTS: Of 17 patients enrolled and treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for cycle-1, 15 received subsequent cycle(s) containing LMB-2 and were therefore evaluable for response. Lack of antibody formation permitted retreatment in most patients. Of 10 evaluable leukemic patients receiving 25+250 or 30+300 mg/m(2) of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, 6 (60%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 2 (20%) partial remission (PR), and all 5 with >25% leukemic cells achieved CR. No responses were achieved in 5 with lymphomatous ATL or lower fludarabine and cyclophosphamide doses. Median CR duration for the 6 CRs was 40 weeks. One is without detectable ATL at 47 months. Toxicity was mostly attributable to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Capillary leak from LMB-2 was non-dose limiting. One patient in CR died of a preexisting infection. CONCLUSIONS: LMB-2, administered with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to prevent antidrug antibodies and rapid intercycle progression, is highly effective in achieving CR in leukemia ATL. Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide dose/schedule is important for safety and efficacy in this high-risk population.","['Z01 BC010301-11/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (B3(Fv)-PE38KDEL recombinant immunotoxin)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['NIHMS999260'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exercise during IC may ameliorate declines but has not been rigorously tested. We examined the efficacy of supervised exercise during IC on QOL, fatigue, and fitness. Eighty-three inpatients age 18-80 scheduled to receive IC for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML were randomized 2:1 (exercise intervention:control group). Study measures were completed at baseline, post-IC, and following the first cycle of consolidation. The intervention consisted of a supervised mixed-modality, moderate-intensity exercise program (4-5 days per week, 30-60min per session) throughout admission. Recruitment was good (56%), retention excellent (96%), and adherence was 54%. Global QOL improved similarly in both groups from baseline to post-IC (between-group difference 3.0 points, p=0.62). Fatigue improved in the exercise group from baseline to post-IC (potentially clinically important between-group difference of 3.6 points, p=0.23). Aerobic fitness, lower body strength, and grip strength improved in the exercise group (between-group differences p=0.005, p<0.001, p=0.03, respectively).

Therefore, immunotherapy is a feasible and promising approach to treat leukemia. For immunotherapy, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against leukemic cells were induced. In BALB/c mice, leukemia was induced by N-ethyl-N'-nitrosourea (ENU). The mice were treated with recombinant IL-3 and GM-CSF - both 5mug/kg/day for four days to induce functional CTL. The IL-3+GM-CSF treatment increased total leukocyte counts, accompanied by significant increase in CTL activity, in the leukemic mice. The IL-3+GM-CSF treatment also enhanced the expression of both p40 and p35 isoforms of IL-12.

However, the pathological role of activated BRAF in B-cell leukemia development and progression remains unclear. In addition, although HCL patients respond well to the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor vemurafenib, relapses are being observed, suggesting the development of drug resistance in patients with this mutation. To investigate the biological role of BRAF(V600E) in B-cell leukemia, we generated a CLL-like B-cell line, OSUCLL, with doxycycline-inducible BRAF(V600E) expression. Microarray and real-time PCR analysis showed that ABCB1 mRNA is upregulated in these cells, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression as well as function were confirmed by immunoblot and rhodamine exclusion assays. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of BRAF(V600E) and MEK alleviated the BRAF(V600E)-induced ABCB1/P-gp expression. ABCB1 reporter assays and gel shift assays demonstrated that AP-1 activity is crucial in this mechanism. This study, uncovers a pathological role for BRAF(V600E) in B-cell leukemia, and provides further evidence that combination strategies with inhibitors of BRAF(V600E) and MEK can be used to delay disease progression and occurrence of resistance.","['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The B cell receptor (BCR) is a transmembrane antibody, which facilitates the clonal selection of B cells producing secreted antibodies of the same specificity. The diverse antibody repertoire is generated by V(D)J recombination of heavy and light chain genes, whereas affinity maturation is mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated mutagenesis. These processes, which are essential for the generation of adaptive humoral immunity, also render B cells susceptible to chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations that in some cases lead to cancer. In this chapter, we will review the central role of PI3K s in mediating signals from the B cell receptor that not only facilitate the development of functional B cell repertoire, but also support the growth and survival of neoplastic B cells, focusing on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. Perhaps because of the central role played by PI3K in BCR signaling, B cell leukemia and lymphomas are the first diseases for which a PI3K inhibitor has been approved for clinical use.","['BBS/E/B/0000M725/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/000C0409/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '095691/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/000C0407/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",,,,,['EMS66644'],,,,['NLM: EMS66644'],,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: Patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have to undergo multiple full-length spinal x-rays. Repeated exposure to ionizing radiation leads to higher incidence of breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and leukemia. One of the radiation-free methods that are candidates for replacing the x-rays is the magnetic measurement of the spine with Ortelius 800. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were measured with Ortelius. Data from Ortelius were compared with standard spinal x-rays taken the same week. RESULTS: The average Cobb's angle measured by x-ray was 35.11 degrees. The average absolute difference between Ortelius and x-rays was 6.69 degrees. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.0443). An acceptable difference was measured in subgroup of curves that do not exceed 40 degrees (difference 5, p=0.8915). CONCLUSION: Ortelius is most accurate in curves in range of 15-30 degrees of Cobb's angle. In larger curves it is increasingly inaccurate. Most important for clinical practice is the Cobb's angle range over 40 degrees, where the conservative therapy is to be replaced with surgery. Ortelius is not accurate enough in this range and therefore cannot fully substitute full spinal x-rays. It can be used to reduce the number of x-rays in the follow-up of smaller curve angles (Tab. 4, Fig. 8, Ref. 10).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed dicentric chromosome assay (DCAs) before and after CT scan to assess effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on chromosomes. Peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes were collected from 10 patients before and after a CT scan. DCA was performed by analyzing either 1,000 or 2,000 metaphases using both Giemsa staining and centromere-fluorescence in situ hybridization (Centromere-FISH). The increment of DIC formation was compared with effective radiation dose calculated using the computational dosimetry system, WAZA-ARI and dose length product (DLP) in a CT scan. Dicentric chromosome (DIC) formation increased significantly after a single CT scan, and increased DIC formation was found in all patients. A good correlation between the increment of DIC formation determined by analysis of 2,000 metaphases using Giemsa staining and those by 2,000 metaphases using Centromere-FISH was observed. However, no correlation was observed between the increment of DIC formation and the effective radiation dose. Therefore, these results suggest that chromosome cleavage may be induced by one CT scan, and we recommend 2,000 or more metaphases be analyzed in Giemsa staining or Centromere-FISH for DCAs in cases of low-dose radiation exposure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multikinase inhibitor midostaurin (PKC412) is a promising new agent used to treat patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM). We examined the target interaction profiles and the mast cell (MC)-targeting effects of two pharmacologically relevant midostaurin metabolites, CGP52421 and CGP62221. All three compounds, midostaurin and the two metabolites, suppressed IgE-dependent histamine secretion in basophils and MC with reasonable IC(50) values. Midostaurin and CGP62221 also produced growth inhibition and dephosphorylation of KIT in the MC leukemia cell line HMC-1.2, whereas the second metabolite, CGP52421, which accumulates in vivo, showed no substantial effects. Chemical proteomic profiling and drug competition experiments revealed that midostaurin interacts with KIT and several additional kinase targets. The key downstream regulator FES was recognized by midostaurin and CGP62221, but not by CGP52421 in MC lysates, whereas the IgE receptor downstream target SYK was recognized by both metabolites. Together, our data show that the clinically relevant midostaurin metabolite CGP52421 inhibits IgE-dependent histamine release, but is a weak inhibitor of MC proliferation, which may have clinical implications and may explain why mediator-related symptoms improve in SM patients even when disease progression occurs.","['F 4611/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 4704/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 4711/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P 21173/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']","['0 (CGP 52421)', '0 (CGP 62221)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",,,,,['EMS68570'],,,,['NLM: EMS68570'],,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7409-4204'],,,,,,,,

There are few studies describing transfusion burden after allogeneic HSCT. AIMS: This study aims to quantify and identify determinants of transfusion burden after allogeneic HSCT to improve planning, inventory management and patient counselling. METHODS: A retrospective audit of blood use (red cells and platelets) of all adult HSCT (n = 169) was performed over an 8-year period extracted from pathology and hospital databases. ABO compatibility, graft type, conditioning regimens and patient factors were analysed for up to 12 months post transplant. RESULTS: Transfusion burden was lower than expected and lower than reported by other groups. The median number of units transfused was four red cells and four platelets by day 30, and six red cells and six platelets by day 365. The median time to transfusion independence was 12 days for red cells and 16 days for platelets. Factors associated with increased red cell use included sex, disease stage, graft type (cord blood) and ABO compatibility. Disease stage and graft type (cord blood) were associated with increased platelet transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Donor and patient characteristics are associated with transfusion burden after allogeneic HSCT. Determining transfusion burden in HSCT and identifying determinants of increased transfusion use assist in inventory planning and patient information.",,,,['(c) 2015 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],,,,['Intern Med J. 2016 Mar;46(3):380.

Positive results in initial trials led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to grant ibrutinib three breakthrough therapy designations for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), del17p chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Ibrutinib was approved for these three cancers within 14 months of the original U.S. approval. Additionally, ibrutinib is approved for patient subsets with MCL and/or CLL in >45 other countries. Via a unique mechanism of action, ibrutinib inhibits B cell signaling pathways that regulate the survival, proliferation, adhesion, and homing of cancerous cells. This marks a paradigm shift from the conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy approach to treating B cell malignancies. Ibrutinib continues to be evaluated across a range of B cell malignancies, either as single-agent therapy or in combination with other therapies, and continues to transform the lives of these patients.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Epub 2015 Sep 8.,"BACKGROUND: Tumour classification, based on histopathology or molecular pathology, is of value to predict tumour behaviour and to select appropriate treatment. In retinoblastoma, pathology information is not available at diagnosis and only exists for enucleated tumours. Alternative methods of tumour classification, using noninvasive techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are urgently required to guide treatment decisions at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: High-resolution magic-angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR-MAS MRS) was undertaken on enucleated retinoblastomas. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis of the HR-MAS MRS data was used to identify tumour subgroups. Individual metabolite concentrations were determined and were correlated with histopathological risk factors for each group. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified three metabolic subgroups of retinoblastoma, with the most discriminatory metabolites being taurine, hypotaurine, total-choline and creatine. Metabolite concentrations correlated with specific histopathological features: taurine was correlated with differentiation, total-choline and phosphocholine with retrolaminar optic nerve invasion, and total lipids with necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that a metabolite-based classification of retinoblastoma can be obtained using ex vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and that the subgroups identified correlate with histopathological features. This result justifies future studies to validate the clinical relevance of these subgroups and highlights the potential of in vivo MRS as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for retinoblastoma patient stratification.","['NIHR-RP-02-12-019/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)', '5L08GE4332 (hypotaurine)', 'MU72812GK0 (Creatine)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",,,,,,,,,,"[""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group""]",,,,,,,,,,,

Pregnancy-related outcomes in dasatinib-treated patients or their partners reported to Bristol-Myers Squibb from clinical trials or healthcare providers through December 2013 were reviewed. Outcomes were available in 46/78 dasatinib-treated women (59%) and 33/69 partners of dasatinib-treated men (48%). Fifteen women (33%) delivered a normal infant; 18 (39%) and 8 (17%) had an elective or spontaneous abortion; and 5 (11%) had an abnormal pregnancy. There were 7 reports of fetal/infant abnormalities (encephalocele, renal tract abnormalities, and hydrops fetalis). Thirty of 33 (91%) infants fathered by dasatinib-treated men were reported normal at birth. Also, animal studies evaluated the impact of dasatinib on fertility, embryo-fetal toxicity, and development, suggesting that dasatinib may be a selective developmental toxicant. The outcomes of most pregnancies conceived by men treated with dasatinib were normal, but due to the small number of cases, further monitoring is required. Significant effects on pregnancy outcomes in women treated with dasatinib were found, supporting current recommendations that women avoid becoming pregnant during dasatinib treatment and be informed of fetal risks.",['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS829328'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 8.,"Mastocytosis is a complex disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal mast cells (MC) in the skin, bone marrow and/or other visceral organs. The clinical manifestations result from MC-derived mediators and, less frequently, from destructive infiltration of MCs. Patients suffer from a variety of symptoms including pruritus, flushing and life-threatening anaphylaxis. Whilst mastocytosis is likely to be suspected in a patient with typical skin lesions [i.e. urticaria pigmentosa (UP)], the absence of cutaneous signs does not rule out the diagnosis of this disease. Mastocytosis should be suspected in cases of recurrent, unexplained or severe insect-induced anaphylaxis or symptoms of MC degranulation without true allergy. In rare cases, unexplained osteoporosis or unexplained haematological abnormalities can be underlying feature of mastocytosis, particularly when these conditions are associated with elevated baseline serum tryptase levels. The diagnosis is based on the World Health Organization criteria, in which the tryptase level, histopathological and immunophenotypic evaluation of MCs and molecular analysis are crucial. A somatic KIT mutation, the most common of which is D816V, is usually detectable in MCs and their progenitors. Once a diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (SM) is made, it is mandatory to assess the burden of the disease, its activity, subtype and prognosis, and the appropriate therapy. Mastocytosis comprises seven different categories that range from indolent forms, such as cutaneous and indolent SM, to progressive forms, such as aggressive SM and MC leukaemia. Although prognosis is good in patients with indolent forms of the disease, patients with advanced categories have a poor prognosis.",,,,['(c) 2015 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 7.,"Indirubin-3-oxime (I3O), a synthetic derivative of indirubin, was originally designed as potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) for leukemia therapy. In the current study, we have shown, for the first time, that I3O prevented 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA)-induced neuronal apoptosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. GSK3beta inhibitors but not CDK5 inhibitors reduced the neurotoxicity induced by 6OHDA. Moreover, the activation of GSK3beta was observed after 6OHDA treatment. Furthermore, 6OHDA substantially decreased the transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), a transcription factor that plays an important role in dopaminergic neuron survival, and reduced nuclear localized MEF2D expression. Interestingly, indirubin-3-oxime and GSK3beta inhibitors prevented 6OHDA-induced dysregulation of MEF2D. In addition, short hairpin RNA-mediated decrease of MEF2D expression significantly abolished the neuroprotective effects of indirubin-3-oxime. Collectively, our results strongly suggested that indirubin-3-oxime prevented 6OHDA-induced neurotoxicity via activating MEF2D, possibly through the inhibition of GSK3beta. In view of the capability of indirubin-3-oxime to cross the blood-brain barrier, our findings further indicated that indirubin-3-oxime might be a novel drug candidate for neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease in particular.",,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2D protein, rat)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Oximes)', ""0 (indirubin-3'-monoxime)"", '8HW4YBZ748 (Oxidopamine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are the characteristics of the execution phase of apoptotic cell death. In addition, accumulating data clearly show that some nuclear events can lead to the induction of apoptosis. In particular, if DNA lesions resulting from deregulation during the cell cycle or DNA damage induced by chemotherapeutic drugs or viral infection cannot be efficiently eliminated, apoptotic mechanisms, which enable cellular transformation to be avoided, are activated in the nucleus. The functional heterogeneity of the nuclear organization allows the tight regulation of these signaling events that involve the movement of various nuclear proteins to other intracellular compartments (and vice versa) to initiate and govern apoptosis. Here, we discuss how these events are coordinated to execute apoptotic cell death.",,"['0 (Chromatin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correct identification is essential for the initiation of the specific treatment, but concomitant mold infections are rarely reported. We report one unprecedented case of concomitant mucormycosis and fusariosis in a neutropenic patient with acute myeloid leukemia. The patient developed rhino-orbital infection by Rhizopus arrhizus and disseminated infection by Fusarium solani. The first culture from a sinus biopsy grew Rhizopus, which was consistent with the histopathology report of mucormycosis. A second sinus biopsy collected later during the patient's clinical deterioration was reported as hyalohyphomycosis, and the culture yielded F. solani. Due to the discordant reports, the second biopsy was reviewed and two hyphae types suggestive of both hyalohyphomycetes and mucormycetes were found. The dual mold infection was confirmed by PCR assays from paraffinized tissue sections. Increased awareness of the existence of dual mold infections in at-risk patients is necessary. PCR methods in tissue sections may increase the diagnosis of dual mold infections. In case of sequential biopsies showing discrepant results, mixed infections have to be suspected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently demonstrated that 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a dual energy (glycolysis inhibition) and ER-stress (N-linked-glycosylation inhibition) inducer, leads to cell death in ALL via ER-stress/UPR-mediated apoptosis. Among ALL subtypes, BCR-ABL+ ALL cells exhibited the highest sensitivity to 2-DG suggesting BCR-ABL expression may be linked to this increased vulnerability. To confirm the role of BCR-ABL, we constructed a NALM6/BCR-ABL stable cell line and found significant increase in 2-DG-induced apoptosis compared to control. We found that Mcl-1 was downregulated by agents inducing ER-stress and Mcl-1 levels correlated with ALL sensitivity. In addition, we showed that Mcl-1 expression is positively regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway, dependent on BCR-ABL, and further downregulated by combining ER-stressors with TKIs. We determined that energy/ER stressors led to translational repression of Mcl-1 via the AMPK/mTOR and UPR/PERK/eIF2alpha pathways. Taken together, our data indicate that BCR-ABL+ ALL exhibits heightened sensitivity to induction of energy and ER-stress through inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway, and translational repression of Mcl-1 expression via AMPK/mTOR and UPR/PERK/eIF2alpha pathways. This study supports further consideration of strategies combining energy/ER-stress inducers with BCR-ABL TKIs for future clinical translation in BCR-ABL+ ALL patients.","['R01 GM038545/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 GM038545/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Metastatic calcinosis cutis (MCC) may develop if hypercalcemia persists. We report the case of a 5-year-old girl with an atypical dermatosis and unspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. Considered clinical diagnoses were xanthomas, histiocytosis, molluscum contagiosum, and nongenital warts. Cutaneous histological analysis showed amorphous basophilic deposits in the dermis suggestive of calcium deposits. Laboratory tests confirmed serum hypercalcemia. Extensive investigations such as bone marrow biopsy established the diagnosis of an acute pre-B cell lymphoblastic leukemia. Hypercalcemia in hematopoietic malignancies is unusual, especially as initial manifestation of the disease. Careful review of the literature fails to reveal previous reports of these peculiar cutaneous lesions of MCC in children with leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a novel polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30/sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyethyleneglycol-coated liposome loaded with CC flavonoids (CCFs) was developed to enhance solubility and the antibrain tumor effect, and the molecular mechanism regarding how CCF nanoliposomes (CCF-NLs) induce apoptotic cell death in vitro was investigated. DBTRG-05MG GBM cell lines treated with CCF-NLs showed potential antiproliferative effects. Regarding the underlying mechanisms of inducing apoptosis in DBTRG-05MG GBM cells, CCF-NLs were shown to downregulate the expression of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), an apoptosis-related protein family member, but the expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein was enhanced compared with that in controls. CCF-NLs also inhibited the activity of caspase-3 and -9, which is the initiator caspase of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Blockade of caspase activation consistently induced apoptosis and inhibited growth in CCF-NL-treated DBTRG-05MG cells. This study further investigated the role of the Akt pathway in the apoptotic cell death by CCF-NLs, showing that CCF-NLs deactivated Akt.

Moreover, a frequent deletion in the 3q13.31 chromosome region has been identified in patients who are affected by osteosarcomas. Among the genes located within the deleted region, the involvement of the limbic system-associated membrane protein gene (LSAMP), together with a non-coding RNA tumor suppressor candidate 7 gene (TUSC7), has been suggested. We describe the case of an adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with a novel chromosomal rearrangement characterized by a 3q13.31 microdeletion and an extra copy of the 3q13.31-q29 chromosomal region translocated to the long arm of the Y chromosome. This karyotypic aberration seems to cause LSAMP and TUSC7 gene expression dysregulation. In conclusion, we report the first case of LSAMP and TUSC7 gene overexpression, possibly due to a position effect in an AML patient bearing a 3q13.31 cryptic deletion.",,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (limbic system-associated membrane protein)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A decision-analytic Markov cohort model with three health states and 1-month cycle time was developed and run within a life time horizon. Data from two multinational, prospective, open-label Phase 3 studies were used to assess patients' survival. While utilities were generalized from UK data, local resource utilization and disease-associated treatment, hospitalization, and side effect costs were applied. The alternative scenario was performed to assess the impact of lower life expectancy of the general population in Ukraine on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for treatment-naive patients. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. The ICER (in US dollars) of treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with FCR versus FC is US$8,704 per quality-adjusted life year gained for treatment-naive patients and US$11,056 for refractory/relapsed patients. When survival data were modified to the lower life expectancy of the general population in Ukraine, the ICER for treatment-naive patients was higher than US$13,000. This value is higher than three times the current gross domestic product per capita in Ukraine. Sensitivity analyses have shown a high impact of rituximab costs and a moderate impact of differences in utilities on the ICER. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analyses have shown that for refractory/relapsed patients the probability of FCR being cost-effective is higher than for treatment-naive patients and is close to one if the threshold is higher than US$15,000. State coverage of rituximab treatment may be considered a cost-effective treatment for the Ukrainian population under conditions of economic stability, cost-effectiveness threshold growth, or rituximab price negotiations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major cancer sequencing initiatives have therefore focused on recurrent mutations that are more likely to be drivers. However, in specific genetic contexts, low frequency mutations may also be capable of participating in oncogenic processes. Reliable strategies for identifying these rare or even patient-specific (private) mutations are needed in order to elucidate more personalized approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Here we performed whole-exome sequencing on three cases of childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL), representing three cytogenetically-defined subgroups (high hyperdiploid, t(12;21) translocation, and cytogenetically normal). We applied a data reduction strategy to identify both common and rare/private somatic events with high functional potential. Top-ranked candidate mutations were subsequently validated at high sequencing depth on an independent platform and in vitro expression assays were performed to evaluate the impact of identified mutations on cell growth and survival. RESULTS: We identified 6 putatively damaging non-synonymous somatic mutations among the three cALL patients. Three of these mutations were well-characterized common cALL mutations involved in constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (FLT3 p.D835Y, NRAS p.G13D, BRAF p.G466A). The remaining three patient-specific mutations (ACD p.G223V, DOT1L p.V114F, HCFC1 p.Y103H) were novel mutations previously undescribed in public cancer databases. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated a protective effect of the ACD p.G223V mutation against apoptosis in leukemia cells. ACD plays a key role in protecting telomeres and recruiting telomerase. Using a telomere restriction fragment assay, we also showed that this novel mutation in ACD leads to increased telomere length in leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: This study identified ACD as a novel gene involved in cALL and points to a functional role for ACD in enhancing leukemia cell survival. These results highlight the importance of rare/private somatic mutations in understanding cALL etiology, even within well-characterized molecular subgroups.",['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['0 (ACD protein, human)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since bone marrow cell transplantation is seriously limited by the availability of the immune-paired donor sources, the therapy for pediatric leukemia remains challenging.

METHODS: We examined the effects of GRh2 on the survival of mice in an acute leukemia model. We analyzed the effects of GRh2 on the cell viability of leukemia cell lines in vitro, using a CCK-8 assay and an MTT assay. We analyzed the effects of GRh2 on the apoptosis of leukemia cell lines in vitro, by flow cytometry. We analyzed the levels of Bcl-2 and microRNA-21 (miR-21) in GRh2-treated leukemia cells. Prediction of binding between miR-21 and 3'-UTR of Bcl-2 mRNA was performed by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: GRh2 significantly prolonged the survival of mice with pediatric leukemia. GRh2 significantly decreased the viability of leukemia cells in vitro, through induction of apoptosis. GRh2 significantly decreased the levels of an anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in leukemia cells, possibly through induction of miR-21, which suppressed the translation of Bcl-2 mRNA via 3'-UTR binding.

To identify a more robust risk stratification model, a molecular risk score was developed based on expression levels of the genes BAALC, ERG and WT1. Hereby, the main focus was on prediction of relapse. The integrative risk score divided patients into two groups with highly significant differences in outcome. It discriminated a high risk group with a high incidence of relapse successfully from a low risk group with no APL-related events after achievement of first remission. Especially the concurrent presence of molecular risk factors showed to be a negative prognostic factor in APL.

The present study examines whether BCL2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predispose to CML or may potentially influence the disease characteristics at diagnosis. Notably, no association was observed between the four candidate BCL2 SNPs and the risk of developing CML. Instead, the 4777C>A (rs2279115) and the 5735A>G (rs1801018) SNPs were significantly associated with the disease risk profile as determined by the Sokal score. We found that such polymorphisms correlated with the expression of BCL2 alternative splicing transcripts (BCL2-alpha, BCL2-beta) in healthy donors, but not in CML patients, although the relative levels of BCL2 mRNA splicing variants were shown to change during the clinical course of CML. Our findings suggest that BCL2 polymorphisms could influence the clinical features of CML patients at diagnosis. However, the pathogenic mechanisms involved in such association remain to be ascertained.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Magnetic fields are not the only factor that varies in their vicinity, complicating interpretation of any associations. Underground cables (UGCs), however, produce magnetic fields but have no other discernible effects in their vicinity. We report here the largest ever epidemiological study of high voltage UGCs, based on 52,525 cases occurring from 1962-2008, with matched birth controls. We calculated the distance of the mother's address at child's birth to the closest 275 or 400 kV ac or high-voltage dc UGC in England and Wales and the resulting magnetic fields. Few people are exposed to magnetic fields from UGCs limiting the statistical power. We found no indications of an association of risk with distance or of trend in risk with increasing magnetic field for leukaemia, and no convincing pattern of risks for any other cancer. Trend estimates for leukaemia as shown by the odds ratio (and 95% confidence interval) per unit increase in exposure were: reciprocal of distance 0.99 (0.95-1.03), magnetic field 1.01 (0.76-1.33). The absence of risk detected in relation to UGCs tends to add to the argument that any risks from overhead lines may not be caused by magnetic fields.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 4.,"Human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), filgrastim (Neupogen; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA), has been widely used for the mobilization of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from healthy donors. The experience with biosimilar G-CSF agents in this area is limited. We performed a prospective study assessing Tevagrastim (biosimilar filgrastim, XMO2; Teva, Israel) for mobilization of CD34(+) peripheral blood HSC in HLA-matched healthy sibling donors for transplantation in 24 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (NCT01542944). Results were compared to a historical control group of sibling donors who received filgrastim for stem cell mobilization for allogeneic stem cell transplantations in patients with AML and MDS. The healthy donors received Tevagrastim or filgrastim in a dose of 10 mug/kg body weight (BW) subcutaneously for 4 days. The target yields of CD34(+) cells was 5 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg BW of the recipient. A median 10.2 x 10(6) (range, 2.52 to 35.4) and 9.35 x 10(6) (range, 3.7 to 30.6) CD34(+) cells per kg BW were collected in the Tevagrastim and filgrastim groups, respectively. All patients promptly engrafted with a median day of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of >.5 x 10(9)/L and >1 x 10(9)/L of 13 days (range, 10 to 21) and 13.5 days (range, 10 to 22), respectively in the Tevagrastim group and 12 days (range, 10 to 18) and 13 days (range, 10 to 18) in the filgrastim group, respectively. Platelets reached counts of >20 x 10(9)/L and >50 x 10(9)/L within a median of 14 days (range, 11 to 33) and 17 days (range, 12 to 33) in the Tevagrastim group and 13 (range, 10 to 29) and 15 (range, 10 to 32) days in the filgrastim group, respectively. The donors developed only mild and transient side effects, which were not different between the Tevagrastim study group and the filgrastim historical control group. Similarly, the transplantation-related toxicities and outcomes did not differ between the patients who underwent transplantation with Tevagrastim-mobilized grafts and the filgrastim historical controls. In summary, we observed a similar yield of CD34(+) stem cell mobilization in the Tevagrastim study group and the filgrastim historical control group with similar engraftment kinetic, hematopoietic reconstitution, and transplantation outcome. Tevagrastim administration was safe with minimal side effects and toxicity not different than historical controls. The lack of significant differences for all parameters of stem cell collection, engraftment, and safety with the biosimilar XMO2 Tevagrastim demonstrate the ""similarity"" of the biosimilar and recombinant human G-CSF in this indication.",,"['0 (Hematologic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Sep 4.,"The treatment of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with transplant has not been optimized. We retrospectively reviewed the data for 83 consecutive patients with CMML (47 with CMML-1/2 and 36 with CMML progressed to acute myeloid leukemia) who received an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) at our institution between April 1991 and December 2013 to identify factors associated with improved survival and determine whether treatment with hypomethylating agents before transplant improves progression-free survival (PFS). The median age of the cohort was 57 years. Seventy-eight patients received induction treatment before transplant, with 37 receiving hypomethylating agents and 41 receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Patients treated with a hypomethylating agent had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years post-transplant (22%) than those treated with other agents (35%; P = .03), whereas treatment-related mortality at 1 year post-transplant did not significantly differ between the groups (27% and 30%, respectively; P = .84). The lower relapse rate resulted in a significantly higher 3-year PFS rate in patients treated with a hypomethylating agent (43%) than in those treated with other agents (27%; P = .04). Our data support the use of hypomethylating agents before allo-SCT for patients with CMML to achieve morphologic remission and improve PFS of these patients. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings.","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2016 Jan;22(1):1-2.

Epub 2015 Sep 5.,"We updated the mortality experience of North American synthetic rubber industry workers to include follow-up from 1944 through 2009, adding 11 years of mortality data to previous investigations. The present analysis used Cox regression to examine the exposure-response relationship between 1,3-butadiene (BD) and styrene (STY) parts per million (ppm)-years and leukemia (N = 114 deaths), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (N = 89) and multiple myeloma (MM) (N = 48). A pattern of largely monotonically increasing rate ratios across deciles of BD ppm-years and a positive, statistically significant exposure-response trend were observed for BD ppm-years and leukemia. Using continuous, untransformed BD ppm-years the regression coefficient (beta) adjusted only for age was 2.6 x 10(-4) (p < 0.01); the regression coefficient adjusted for age, year of birth, race and plant was 2.9 x 10(-4) (p < 0.01). STY ppm-years also displayed a positive exposure-response association with leukemia. STY and BD were strongly correlated, and the separate effects of these two agents could not be estimated. For NHL, a pattern of approximately monotonically increasing rate ratios across deciles of exposure was seen for STY but not for BD; the test of trend was statistically significant in one of five models that used different STY exposure metrics and adjusted for age and other covariates. BD ppm-years and STY ppm-years were not associated with MM. The present analyses indicated a positive exposure-response relationship between BD cumulative exposure and leukemia. This result along with other research and biological information support an interpretation that BD causes leukemia in humans. STY exposure also was positively associated with leukemia, but its independent effect could not be delineated because of its strong correlation with BD, and there is no external support for a STY-leukemia association. STY, but not BD, was associated positively with NHL. The interpretation of this result is uncertain because the exposure-response data were statistically imprecise and because consistent support for causality from other studies is lacking. The current study provides no support for an association between BD or STY and MM.",,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Elastomers)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Sep 7.,"Modest transcriptional changes caused by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms are frequent in human cancer. Although loss or near-complete loss of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice, a similar degree of PU.1 impairment is exceedingly rare in human AML; yet, moderate PU.1 inhibition is common in AML patients. We assessed functional consequences of modest reductions in PU.1 expression on leukemia development in mice harboring DNA lesions resembling those acquired during human stem cell aging. Heterozygous deletion of an enhancer of PU.1, which resulted in a 35% reduction of PU.1 expression, was sufficient to induce myeloid-biased preleukemic stem cells and their subsequent transformation to AML in a DNA mismatch repair-deficient background. AML progression was mediated by inhibition of expression of a PU.1-cooperating transcription factor, Irf8. Notably, we found marked molecular similarities between the disease in these mice and human myelodysplastic syndrome and AML. This study demonstrates that minimal reduction of a key lineage-specific transcription factor, which commonly occurs in human disease, is sufficient to initiate cancer development, and it provides mechanistic insight into the formation and progression of preleukemic stem cells in AML.","['P30CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00CA131503/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA131503/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",,,,,['NIHMS764576'],,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA circuit known as catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) is enzyme-free and can be simply operated to achieve exponential amplification, which has been widely employed in biosensing. However, application of CHA has been hindered by the need of specially redesigned sequences for each single-stranded DNA input. Herein, a transducer hairpin (HP) was designed to obtain a universal DNA circuit with favorable signal-to-background ratio. To further improve signal amplification, GS/PANI/AuNPs with excellent conductivity and enlarged effective area were introduced into this DNA circuit. Consequently, by combining the advantages of CHA and GS/PANI/AuNPs, bcr/abl could be detected in a linear range from 10 pM to 20 nM with a detection limit of 1.05 pM. Moreover, this protocol showed excellent specificity, good stability and was successfully applied for the detection of real sample, which demonstrated its great potential in clinical application.",,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (polyaniline)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '7782-42-5 (Graphite)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite its efficacy, about a third of patients discontinue the treatment due to therapy failure or intolerance. The rational identification of patients less likely to respond to imatinib would be of paramount clinical relevance. We have shown that transmembrane transporter hOCT1 genotyping predicts imatinib activity. In parallel, Polycomb group genes (PcGs) are epigenetic repressors implicated in CML progression and in therapy resistance. PATIENTS & METHODS: We measured the expression of eight PcGs in paired pre- and post-imatinib bone marrow samples from 30 CML patients. RESULTS: BMI1, PHC3, CBX6 and CBX7 expression was significantly increased during imatinib treatment. Post-treatment levels of CBX6 and CBX7 predicted 3-month response rate. Measurement of post-treatment BMI1 levels improved the predictive power of hOCT1 genotyping. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the expression levels of PcGs might be useful for a more accurate risk stratification of CML patients.","['12SDG12220014/American Heart Association-American Stroke Association/United', 'States']","['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (CBX7 protein, human)', '0 (PHC3 protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (cbx6 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis of AML is based on identification of the specific myeloid cell initiating the disease, quantification of immature blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood, as well as detection of mutations and translocations. The heterogeneity of AML is caused by a block in differentiation that may occur in any of the different myeloid cell populations. These undifferentiated cells also harbor an increased proliferation potential that leads to accumulation of immature leukemic cells. The current development of more sensitive and less labor intensive analysis methods has led classification of patients from being a system based on morphology of the leukemic cells to being more sophisticated, detecting translocations and small mutations found in the whole leukemic clone or in a minor subclone. This review aims to describe the most common classification systems of AML, including frequently occurring translocations, mutations and epigenetic alterations, as well as describe traditional and novel methods for diagnosis and analysis of these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cytostatic combinations, while effective in some subpopulations of patients, are often limited by extensive toxicity and/or development of tumor resistance. Although standard chemotherapy still remains a common therapeutic tool in the fight with cancer, immunotherapy increasingly revolutionizes treatment strategy for several hematologic malignancies. For a subset of patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, the introduction of subsequently developed classes of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has resulted in improved overall response rates and, to some extent, patient overall survival. Rituximab, the most thoroughly-explored chimeric mouse anti-human anti-CD20 mAb, has been widely and successfully introduced to oncohematology, but also to other fields of medicine, such as transfusiology or rheumatology. Currently, several new generation anti-CD20 mAbs are undergoing different stages of preclinical and clinical studies of assessment to further improve the outcome and overcome mechanisms of resistance. The nature of the direct mechanisms responsible for the anticancer properties of different classes of anti-CD20 mAbs is still not fully understood. This is reflected in different approaches during the investigation of novel anti-CD20 agents. So far, three classes of anti- CD20 mAb have been described.

Epub 2015 Sep 3.,"BACKGROUND: Certain hematologic malignancies are associated with hypereosinophilia or tissue eosinophilia. It is unclear if patients with hypereosinophilia are more likely to develop one of these malignancies. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to quantify the specific hematologic malignancies that developed in patients with preexisting hypereosinophilia. METHODS: Adult patients with eosinophilia associated with the development of hematologic malignancy were identified by a retrospective review of the Mayo Clinic patient database between 2000 and 2013. RESULTS: Of 2642 patients identified with eosinophilia, hypereosinophilia, or hypereosinophilic syndrome, 25 (aged 28.8 to 86.1 years; 13 male; 12 female) had a diagnosis of either lymphoma or leukemia. The majority of these patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17 of 25). T-cell-derived lymphomas were more common (12 of 17) than B-cell-derived lymphomas (4 of 17). In patients with leukemia (8 of 25), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4 of 8) was most common, followed by chronic eosinophilic leukemia (3 of 8). Approximately 5.1% of patients with hypereosinophilia developed a hematologic malignancy. On average, the malignancy developed 30.0 +/- 42.7 months after the onset of hypereosinophilia. CONCLUSIONS: The development of hematologic malignancies in this referral population with eosinophilia was rare (0.2%), but more common in those with hypereosinophilia (5.1%). Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, particularly T-cell-derived malignancies, were most commonly diagnosed. Patients with preexisting hypereosinophilia were diagnosed with hematologic conditions that were rarer within the general population.",,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with MS, as the tumor cells were positive for myeloperoxidase and CD68 but negative for CD163. After treatment with steroids and radiation, the size of the tumor was markedly reduced and peripheral blood count was normal. Bone marrow examination showed 89.2% consisted of unclassified promyelocytes characterized by round nuclei and abundant small azurophilic granules but no Auer rods. The results of chromosome analysis showed 46,XY,t(5;17)(q35;q12). Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplified the NPM1/RARA fusion transcripts derived from a combination of NPM1 exon 4 and RARA exon 5, or of NPM1 exon 1 and RARA exon 5; the latter of these has not been reported previously. Electron microscopic examination of the promyelocyte nuclei showed they were oval with mild nuclear chromatin condensation and small- to medium-sized nucleoli. Hematological and molecular complete remission was attained after induction therapy including all-trans retinoic acid.

Epub 2015 Sep 3.,"Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is considered a promising strategy in the treatment of beta-thalassemia, in which production of adult hemoglobin (HbA) is impaired by mutations affecting the beta-globin gene. Recent results indicate that B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) is a major repressor of gamma-globin gene expression. Therefore, disrupting the binding of the BCL11A transcriptional repressor complex to the gamma-globin gene promoter provides a novel approach for inducing expression of the gamma-globin genes. To develop a cellular screening system for the identification of BCL11A inhibitors, we produced K562 cell clones with integrated copies of a BCL11A-XL expressing vector. We characterized 12 K562 clones expressing different levels of BCL11A-XL and found that a clear inverse relationship does exist between the levels of BCL11A-XL and the extent of hemoglobinization induced by a panel of HbF inducers. Using mithramycin as an inducer, we found that this molecule was the only HbF inducer efficient in rescuing the ability to differentiate along the erythroid program, even in K562 cell clones expressing high levels of BCL11A-XL, suggesting that BCL11A-XL activity is counteracted by mithramycin.",['GGP10214/Telethon/Italy'],"['0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the failure of acute myeloid leukemia patients to achieve remission as a result of drug resistance remains a challenge. In this study, we found that the abundances of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 and its receptor (IL-18R) correlated with the occurrence of drug resistance in AML patients during standard treatment. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) has been suggested to have an antiapoptotic role in chemoresistant cancer cells. IL-18 treatment resulted in an increase in COX-2 expression through the post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 mRNA in differentiated U937 cells and showed antiapoptotic activity in U937 and THP-1 cells. Two RNA-binding proteins, human antigen R and insulin-like growth factor mRNA-binding protein 3, mediated the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA.

Epub 2015 Sep 3.,"BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) plays essential roles in female reproductive physiology. In vitro studies have shown that AR exerts 2 distinct but related functions in myometrial cells. The AR is required for myometrial cell cycling ligand independently, thereby controls myometrial cell proliferation. The AR also exerts antiapoptotic functions through myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) in both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manners. However, these AR functions have not yet been confirmed in vivo. This study provides in vivo evidence that AR expression is associated with myometrial cell proliferation and apoptosis. METHODS: Myometrial tissue was collected on day 6 of pregnancy from mice bearing an intact AR (AR+/+) or mice with AR heterozygous (AR-/+) or homozygous (AR-/-) functional knockout. Human uterine leiomyoma and paired myometrial tissue biopsies (n = 14 patients) were collected during hysterectomy. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the protein expression of AR, MCL1, and Ki-67 index, as well as the functional associations of AR with MCL1 and Ki-67 index. RESULTS: In AR-/- mice, MCL1 protein levels were reduced approximately 50% in both circular and longitudinal myometrial cells when compared with that in AR+/+ and AR-/+ mice. By contrast, Ki-67 index remained unchanged. The AR protein expression and Ki-67 index in leiomyoma were approximately 2- to 3-fold higher than that in normal myometrium. Although MCL1 expression was not coordinately increased in leiomyoma, strong positive correlations between AR and MCL1 expression were observed in leiomyoma but not in normal myometrium tissue. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that AR is an important regulator of myometrial growth in vivo during pregnancy and in leiomyoma.",['MOP-111148/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)']",,['(c) The Author(s) 2015.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to analyze erythroid response (ER) and overall survival (OS) in a series of 94 patients with CMML treated with ESA. METHODS: We analyzed a series of 94 patients with CMML treated with ESA included in the Spanish and Dusseldorf-MDS registries. FINDINGS: ER was observed in 64% of patients and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence in 31%. The median duration of ER was 7 months (range, 0-88). CPSS and EPO level were significantly associated with ER in multivariate analysis (P = 0.003). Considering only patients with CPSS low- or intermediate-1-risk group, the absence of RBC transfusion dependence and erythropoietin (EPO) level predicted ER (P = 0.003 and P = 0.008, respectively). In multivariate analysis, only the EPO level retained its prognostic value (P = 0.029). Achievement of ER correlated with a better survival since ER evaluation (P = 0.016). INTERPRETATION: The CPSS and EPO levels are adequate tools to select CMML patients with symptomatic anemia who may benefit from treatment with ESA. A significant ER to ESA is expected in anemic patients with low/intermediate-1 CMML risk by the CPSS and a low endogenous serum EPO level.",,['0 (Hematinics)'],,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this prospective study of 83 Chinese patients (54 children and 29 adults) with de novo T-ALL, we analyzed mutations in 11 T-ALL genes: NOTCH1, FBXW7, PHF6, PTEN, N-RAS, K-RAS, WT1, IL7R, PIK3CA, PIK3RA, and AKT1. NOTCH1 mutations were identified in 51.9 and 37.9 % of pediatric and adult patients, respectively, and these patients showed improved overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). The FBXW7 mutant was present in 25.9 and 6.9 % of pediatric and adult patients, respectively, and was associated with inferior OS and EFS in pediatric T-ALL. Multivariate analysis revealed that mutant FBXW7 was an independent prognostic indicator for inferior EFS (hazard ratio [HR] 4.38; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.15-16.71; p = 0.03) and tended to be associated with reduced OS (HR 2.81; 95 % CI 0.91-8.69; p = 0.074) in pediatric T-ALL. Mutant PHF6 was present in 13 and 20.7 % of our childhood and adult cohorts, respectively, while PTEN mutations were noted in 11.1 % of the pediatric patients. PTEN and NOTCH1 mutations were almost mutually exclusive, while IL7R and WT1 mutations were rare in pediatric T-ALL and PTPN11 and AKT1 mutations were infrequent in adult T-ALL.

This work was designed to assess the cytotoxicity of six selected Cameroonian medicinal plants, including Nauclea pobeguinii and its constituents 3-acetoxy-11-oxo-urs-12-ene (1), p-coumaric acid (2), citric acid trimethyl ester (3), resveratrol (4), resveratrol beta- D -glucopyranoside (5) and strictosamide (6), against 8 drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines. METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the crude extracts and compounds, whilst column chromatography was used to isolate the constituents of Nauclea pobeguinii. Structural characterization of isolated compounds was performed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic data. RESULTS: Preliminary experiments on leukemia CCRF-CEM cells at 40 mug/mL showed that the leaves and bark extracts from Tragia benthamii, Canarium schweinfurthii, Myrianthus arboreus, Dischistocalyx grandifolius and Fagara macrophylla induced more than 50 % growth of this cell line contrary to the leaves and bark extracts of N. pobeguinii. IC50 values below or around 30 mug/mL were obtained with leaves and bark extracts of N. pobeguinii towards two and five, respectively, of the 8 tested cancer cell lines. The lowest IC50 value was obtained with the bark extract of N. pobeguinii against HCT116 (p53 (-/-) ) colon cancer cells (8.70 mug/mL). Compounds 4 and 6 displayed selective activity on leukemia and carcinoma cells, whilst 1-3 were not active. IC50 values below 100 muM were recorded with compound 5 on all 9 tested cancer cell lines as well as with 4 against 7 out of 8 and 6 against 2 out of 8 cell lines. Collateral sensitivity was observed in CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells, MDA-MB-231-BCRP breast adenocarcinoma cells (0.53-fold), HCT116 (p53 (+/+) ) cells, human U87MG.DeltaEGFR glioblastome multiforme cells to the methanolic bark extract of N. pobeguinii, as well as in MDA-MB-231-BCRP cells and HCT116 (p53 (+/+) ) cells and U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells (0.86-fold) to compound 5. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate the cytotoxicity of six Cameroonian medicinal plants, Canarium schweinfurthii, Dischistocalyx grandifolius, Tragia benthamii, Fagara macrophylla, Myrianthus arboreus and Nauclea pobeguinii. We also demonstrated the antiproliferative potential of Nauclea pobeguinii against drug-resistant cancer cell lines.

Epub 2015 Sep 1.,"Allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has evolved into a potent curative treatment option for a variety of malignant and nonmalignant diseases. The occurrence of complications and mortality after allo-HCT is, however, still high and is strongly associated with immune reconstitution (IR). Therefore, detailed information on IR through immunomonitoring is crucial to improve survival chances after HCT. To date, information about the reconstituting immune system after allo-HCT in pediatric patients is mostly derived from routine standard-of-care measurements. More profound knowledge on IR may provide tools to better predict and modulate adverse reactions and, subsequently, improve survival chances. Here, we provide an overview of IR (eg, immune cell subsets and circulating chemokines/cytokines) after allo-HCT in children, taking into account different cell sources and serotherapy, and discuss strategies to enhance immunomonitoring. We conclude that available IR data after allo-HCT contain limited information on immune cell families (mostly only generic T, B, and NK cells), which would improve with more detailed information on reconstituting cell subsets or effector cell functionality at earlier time points (<1 month). In addition, secretome data (eg, multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiles) could add to the understanding of IR mechanisms and cell functionality and may even provide (early) biomarkers for individual disease outcome, such as viral reactivity, graft-versus-host disease, or graft-versus-leukemia. The present data and suggestions for more detailed, standardized, and harmonized immunomonitoring in future (pediatric) allo-HCT studies will pave the path to ""precision transplantation:"" an individualized HCT approach (including conditioning), based on detailed information on IR and biomarkers, aiming to reduce transplantation related mortality and relapse, and subsequently improve survival chances.",,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,"['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Sep 4.,"BACKGROUND: While most children with cancer survive their initial disease, cancer therapy places them at risk for late effects (LE). Knowledge of their diagnosis, treatment, and LE risk may motivate survivors to attend long-term follow-up care. The aims of this study were to examine knowledge of cancer history and future risks, and to identify factors associated with such knowledge, in a cohort of childhood cancer survivors. METHODS: Survivors (i.e., patients finished cancer treatment, regardless of time since completion) aged 15 to 26 years from three Canadian cancer centers were invited to complete a questionnaire that assessed knowledge of cancer history and potential LE of treatments, including five specific LE known to have considerable long-term health impact. Clinical data were extracted from hospital records and used to validate participants' answers. RESULTS: Of 250 participants, 16 (6%) were unable to name their cancer, 79 (32%) had partial or no knowledge of their therapy, and 83 (33%) were unaware of at least some of their risks for LE. Decreasing age (OR for increase in age = 1.2 (1.1-1.4)), having had a renal tumor compared to leukemia (OR = 0.3 (0.1-0.9)), and lacking knowledge about treatment (OR = 0.4 (0.2-0.9)) were associated with lack of knowledge of LE. Of the five, the most and least familiar LE was LE associated with impaired pulmonary function and risk of second malignancy, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study highlights knowledge deficits in survivors, specifically regarding their risk for LE. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Findings can be utilized to target survivors at risk for knowledge deficits.",['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We observed a significantly increased number of naive B-cells and decreased number of switched memory B-cells in DiGeorge patients. Furthermore, we observed increased BAFF levels and a trend toward hypergammaglobulinemia later in life. Surprisingly, we detected a decrease in marginal zone-like (MZ-like) B-cells and natural antibodies in DiGeorge patients. CONCLUSION: The maturation of B-cells is impaired in DiGeorge patients, with high naive and low switched memory B-cell numbers being observed. There is a clear trend toward hypergammaglobulinemia later in life, coupled with increased serum BAFF levels.

While numerous studies implicate oxidative stress and DNA damage as playing a role in benzene-mediated carcinogenicity, emerging evidence suggests that alterations in epigenetic regulations may be involved. The present study aimed to determine whether DNA methylation and/or various histone modifications were altered following in utero benzene exposure in CD-1 mice. Global DNA methylation and promoter-specific methylation of the tumor suppressor gene, p15, were assessed. Additionally, levels of acetylated histones H3, H4, and H3K56, as well as methylated histones H3K9 and H3K27 were assessed by Western blotting. A significant decrease in global DNA methylation of maternal bone marrow was observed following benzene exposure; however no effect on global DNA methylation was detected in fetal livers. Additionally, no effect of benzene exposure was observed on p15 promoter methylation or any measured histone modifications in both maternal bone marrow and fetal livers.

Epub 2015 Sep 2.,"Over the two past decades, mutations of the PTPN11 gene, encoding the ubiquitous protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2), have been identified as the causal factor of several developmental diseases (Noonan syndrome (NS), Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NS-ML), and metachondromatosis), and malignancies (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia). SHP2 plays essential physiological functions in organism development and homeostasis maintenance by regulating fundamental intracellular signaling pathways in response to a wide range of growth factors and hormones, notably the pleiotropic Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and the Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase (PI3K)/AKT cascades. Analysis of the biochemical impacts of PTPN11 mutations first identified both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations, as well as more subtle defects, highlighting the major pathophysiological consequences of SHP2 dysregulation. Then, functional genetic studies provided insights into the molecular dysregulations that link SHP2 mutants to the development of specific traits of the diseases, paving the way for the design of specific therapies for affected patients. In this review, we first provide an overview of SHP2's structure and regulation, then describe its molecular roles, notably its functions in modulating the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, and its physiological roles in organism development and homeostasis. In the second part, we describe the different PTPN11 mutation-associated pathologies and their clinical manifestations, with particular focus on the biochemical and signaling outcomes of NS and NS-ML-associated mutations, and on the recent advances regarding the pathophysiology of these diseases.",,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Relapse following remission after induction chemotherapy remains the major barrier to patient survival. ADAM28 is overexpressed in several human tumors and is related to cell proliferation and lymph node metastasis. To date, no information has been available on the prognostic role of ADAM28 in B-ALL. Fifty consecutive patients with de novo B-ALL and 22 healthy donors were enrolled in this study and were followed for 2.8 years. Our data suggested that ADAM28 expression in B-ALL patients was significantly increased (P<0.0001). Patients experiencing disease relapse exhibited significantly increased ADAM28 expression, compared with those with favorable outcomes (P=0.0094). Notably, ADAM28 overexpression was associated with lower probabilities of relapse-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS) (P<0.001) and was a significant prognostic factor (P<0.001). In vitro, the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, as well as arsenic trioxide (ATO), down-regulated ADAM28 expression. Our results were the first to indicate that ADAM28 overexpression in B-ALL patients is correlated with relapse. ADAM28 overexpression is potentially regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. These data demonstrate that ADAM28 might serve as a novel biomarker for evaluating relapse in B-ALL and as a potential therapeutic target in B-ALL patients.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015.

Exploring novel conditioning regimen to more effectively eliminate leukemic clone while not alter transplant-related mortality (TRM) has become focus of attention. We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of 87 high-risk ALL patients undergoing allo-HSCT: 47 patients received idarubicin (IDA) intensified TBI-CY and 40 patients received traditional TBI-CY regimen. In IDA intensified group, patients received TBI (8Gy) on day-8, IDA of 15mg/m(2)/d from day-6 to -5, followed by CY (60mg/kg/d) on day-3 to -2. The cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower in IDA intensified group compared with TBI-CY group (P=0.018). Oropharyngeal mucositis was observed more frequent in IDA intensified group (P=0.013), while not followed by increased TRM. Very high-risk ALL patients benefit from IDA intensified regimen with only two of eight patients in no remission (NR) pre-transplantation and two of twelve ph(+)ALL patients relapsed after transplantation. After a median follow-up for all survivors of 21 months (range, 12-53 months), 2-year estimated OS and DFS was 66.2% vs 45.3% (P=0.031) and 62.5% vs 43.5% (P=0.044), respectively. In conclusion, IDA intensified TBI-CY regimen may reduce relapse while not increasing TRM, providing better survival for high-risk ALL patients undergoing allo-HSCT.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Sep 4.,"BACKGROUND: Various occupations have been associated with an elevated risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but results have been inconsistent across studies. OBJECTIVES: We investigated occupational risk of NHL and of four common NHL subtypes with particular focus on occupations of a priori interest. METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of 10,046 cases and 12,025 controls from 10 NHL studies participating in the InterLymph Consortium. We harmonized the occupational coding using the 1968 International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-1968) and grouped occupations previously associated with NHL into 25 a priori groups. Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for center, age, and sex were determined for NHL overall and for the following four subtypes: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). RESULTS: We confirmed previously reported positive associations between NHL and farming occupations [field crop/vegetable farm workers OR = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05, 1.51; general farm workers OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.37]; we also confirmed associations of NHL with specific occupations such as women's hairdressers (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.74), charworkers/cleaners (OR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.36), spray-painters (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.29), electrical wiremen (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.54), and carpenters (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.93). We observed subtype-specific associations for DLBCL and CLL/SLL in women's hairdressers and for DLBCL and PTCL in textile workers. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled analysis of 10 international studies adds to evidence suggesting that farming, hairdressing, and textile industry-related exposures may contribute to NHL risk. Associations with women's hairdresser and textile occupations may be specific for certain NHL subtypes.

Exportin 1 (XPO1) mediates the nucleocytoplasmic transport of numerous molecules including oncogenic growth-regulating factors, RNAs, and ribosomal subunits. In MCL cells, the small molecule KPT-185 blocks XPO1 function and exerts anti-proliferative effects. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this putative anti-tumor effect on MCL cells using cell growth/viability assays, immunoblotting, gene expression analysis, and absolute quantification proteomics. KPT-185 exhibited a p53-independent anti-lymphoma effect on MCL cells, by suppression of oncogenic mediators (e.g., XPO1, cyclin D1, c-Myc, PIM1, and Bcl-2 family members), repression of ribosomal biogenesis, and downregulation of translation/chaperone proteins (e.g., PIM2, EEF1A1, EEF2, and HSP70) that are part of the translational/transcriptional network regulated by heat shock factor 1. These results elucidate a novel mechanism in which ribosomal biogenesis appears to be a key component through which XPO1 contributes to tumor cell survival. Thus, we propose that the blockade of XPO1 could be a promising, novel strategy for the treatment of MCL and other malignancies overexpressing XPO1.","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EEF1A1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (KPT-185)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.1.17 (EEF2K protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.20 (Elongation Factor 2 Kinase)']",,,,['GEO/GSE70479'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies may have ignored the relationship between myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, where approximately one-third of myelodysplastic syndrome cases will progress to acute myeloid leukemia, which could induce a serious bias in independent analyses. For the purposes of researching pathogenesis, we suggest that myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia should be regarded as a single class of adult myeloid disease, and herein assessed the relationship between cigarette smoking and the risk of adult myeloid disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for reports published from 1990 to 2015. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality and the extracted data. The odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios (OR), a sensitivity analysis, and the publication bias were analyzed using the CMA v2 (Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2) software program. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in this meta-analysis. The publication dates ranged from 1990 to 2014. The pooled OR in current smokers and ever-smokers showed an increased risk of adult myeloid disease, with ORs of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.30-1.62; p<0.001) and 1.23 (95% CI 1.15-1.32; p<0.001) versus non-smokers, respectively. In the subset analyses, the OR of adult myeloid disease was increased regardless of the form of disease, geographical region, NOS (Newcastle Ottawa Scale) score, and source of controls. The smoking status was divided into <20 and >/=20 cigarettes per day, and these groups had ORs of developing adult myeloid disease of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.09-1.40; p = 0.001) and 1.32 (95% CI, 1.14-1.53; p<0.001), respectively. In the groups divided based on the number of years the subjects had smoked (<20 and >/=20 years), the ORs were 1.05 (95% CI, 0.90-1.23; p = 0.25) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.16-1.45; p<0.001), respectively. Similarly, <20 and >/=20 pack-years were associated with ORs of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.03-1.29; p = 0.017) and 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18-1.52; p<0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis, for the first time, combined myelodysplastic syndrome with acute myeloid leukemia to assess the overall risk of adult myeloid disease, and it demonstrated that cigarette smoking is associated with a significantly increased risk of adult myeloid disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD, overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse were investigated according those variables. Acute GVHD incidence was 41% (7.3% GIII-IV). Patients with acute myeloid leukemia had lesser aGVH GII-IV (14% vs. 35%, p<0.01) comparing to the entire population. Extensive cGVHD incidence was 9.4%.

Age, type of donor and myeloablative conditioning showed no significant differences in any outcome. Allogeneic HSCT is a valid therapeutic option for older patients in Argentina. The main risk factor for a significantly increased NRM and a trend to inferior OS was the number of comorbidities. Age was not a factor for a worse result.

Epub 2015 Sep 23.,"CD5(+) B-cell origins and their predisposition to lymphoma are long-standing issues. Transfer of fetal and adult liver BM Pro-B cells generates B cells with distinct phenotypes: fetal cells generate IgM(high) IgD(low) CD5(+) , whereas adult cells IgM(low) IgD(high) CD5(-) . This suggests a developmental switch in B lymphopoiesis, similar to the switch in erythropoiesis. Comparison of mRNA and miRNA expression in fetal and adult Pro-B cells revealed differential expression of Lin28b mRNA and Let-7 miRNA, providing evidence that this regulatory axis functions in the switch. Recent work has shown that Arid3a is a key transcription factor mediating fetal-type B-cell development. Lin28b-promoted fetal development generates CD5(+) B cells as a consequence of positively selected self-reactivity. CD5(+) B cells play important roles in clearance of apoptotic cells and in protective immune responses, but also pose a risk of progression to leukemia/lymphoma. Differential Lin28b expression in fetal and adult human B-cell precursors showed that human B-cell development may resemble mouse, with self-reactive ""innate-like"" B cells generated early in life. It remains to be determined whether such human B cells have a higher propensity to leukemic progression. This review describes our recent research with CD5(+) B cells and presents our perspective on their role in disease.","['R01 CA129330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI026782/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI113320/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 CA145445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI049335/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (CD5 Antigens)'],,"['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To explore the mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced cell death, we investigated the effect of HDMP on canonical Wnt signaling which emerged as a key pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CLL. In this study, the human CLL cell line MEC-1 was incubated with various concentrations of methylprednisolone. Cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK8 assay, the apoptotic effect was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Western blot was used to detect active-caspase 3, and the key proteins in Wnt signaling pathway (LEF-1, beta-catenin). RT-PCR was performed to assess the mRNA levels of beta-catenin, LEF-1, c-myc and cyclin D1. We observed that high concentration of methylprednisolone could suppress the proliferation activity of MEC-1 cells, promote the relative expression of active-caspase 3, and induce apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, methylprednisolone could inhibit LEF-1 protein expression, consequently down-regulate mRNA levels of c-myc and cyclin D1, but could not affect the transcription level of beta-catenin and LEF-1 mRNA.

To investigate how leukemic cells inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and the role of Notch signaling in this process, we cocultured BMSCs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in osteogenic induction medium. The expression levels of Notch1, Hes1, and the osteogenic markers Runx2, Osteopontin (OPN), and Osteocalcin (OCN) were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting on day 3. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was analyzed using an ALP kit, and mineralization deposits were detected by Alizarin red S staining on day 14. And then we treated BMSCs with Jagged1 and anti-Jagged1 neutralizing Ab. The expression of Notch1, Hes1, and the abovementioned osteogenic differentiation markers was measured. Inhibition of the expression of Runx2, OPN, and OCN and reduction of ALP activity and mineralization deposits were observed in BMSCs cocultured with ALL cells, while Notch signal inhibiting rescued these effects. All these results indicated that ALL cells could inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by activating Notch signaling, resulting in a decreased number of osteoblastic cells, which may impair normal hematopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 2.,"PURPOSE: The role of antigen(s) in shaping the T-cell repertoire in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, although relevant for understanding malignant cell interactions with cognate T cells, is largely unexplored. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here we profiled the T-cell receptor beta chain gene repertoire in 58 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, focusing on cases assigned to well-characterized subsets with stereotyped clonotypic B-cell receptor immunoglobulins, therefore those cases most evidently selected by antigen (subsets #1, #2, and #4). RESULTS: Remarkable repertoire skewing and oligoclonality were observed, and differences between subsets were noted regarding both T-cell receptor beta chain gene usage and the extent of clonality, with subset #2 being the least oligoclonal. Longitudinal analysis of subset #4 cases revealed that although the repertoire may fluctuate over time, certain clonotypes persist, thus alluding to persistent antigenic stimulation. Shared (""stereotyped"") clonotypes were found between different patients, reflecting selection by common antigenic elements. Cross-comparison of our dataset with public databases showed that some T-cell clonotypes may have expanded secondary to common viral infections; however, the majority of clonotypes proved to be disease-specific. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the T-cell receptor beta chain repertoire in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is likely shaped by antigen selection and the implicated antigenic elements may concern epitopes that also select the malignant B-cell progenitors or, more intriguingly, chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived epitopes.",,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stat5 is a critical regulator of mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and is essential for normal lymphocyte development. We report that pan-hematopoietic deletion in viable adult Vav1-Cre conditional knockout mice as well as Stat5ab(null/null) fetal liver transplant chimeras generated HSCs with reduced expression of quiescence regulating genes (Tie2, Mpl, Slamf1, Spi1, Cited2) and increased expression of B-cell development genes (Satb1, Dntt, Btla, Flk2). Using a classical murine B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) model, we demonstrate that these HSCs were also poised to produce a burst of B-cell precursors upon expression of Bcl-2 combined with oncogenic Myc. This strong selective advantage for leukemic transformation in the background of Stat5 deficient hematopoiesis was permissive for faster initiation of Myc-induced transformation to B-ALL. However, once established, the B-ALL progression in secondary transplant recipients was Stat5-independent. Overall, these studies suggest that Stat5 can play multiple important roles that not only preserve the HSC compartment but can limit accumulation of potential pre-leukemic lymphoid populations.","['R01 DK059380/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH R01DK059380/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It binds to vanilloid receptor 1, although it has been reported to be able to mediate some effects independently of its receptor. Another important property of Capsaicin is the anticancer activity against highly malignant tumors, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we found that Capsaicin induced an apoptotic cell death in PEL cells correlated with the inhibition of STAT3. STAT3 pathway, constitutively activated in PEL cells, is essential for their survival. By STAT3 de-phosphorylation, Capsaicin reduced the Mcl-1 expression level and this could represent one of the underlying mechanisms leading to the Capsaicin-mediated cell death and autophagy induction. Next, by pharmacological or genetic inhibition, we found that autophagy played a pro-survival role, suggesting that its inhibition could be exploited to increase the Capsaicin cytotoxic effect against PEL cells. Finally, we show that Capsaicin induced DAMP exposure, as for an immunogenic cell death, directly promoted DC activation and, more importantly, that it counteracted the immune-suppression, in terms of DC differentiation, mediated by the PEL released factors.",,"['0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the expression of CD200 in a series of 244 patients with diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), to evaluate its impact on outcome and its possible association with other known prognostic factors. CD200 was found in 136/244 (56%) patients, in 41 of whom (30%) with high intensity of expression (MFI >/= 11). CD200 was more frequent in secondary compared to de novo leukemia (p = 0.0006), in CD34 positive cases (p = 0.00001), in Bcl2 overexpressing cases (p = 0.01), in those wild-type Flt3 (p = 0.004) and with favorable or unfavorable compared to intermediate karyotype (p = 0.0003). CD200+ patients have a two-fold lower probability to attain complete remission, both in univariate (p = 0.006) and multivariate (p = 0.04) analysis. The negative impact of CD200 was found also in overall survival (p = 0.02) and was correlated with the intensity of expression of the molecule (p = 0.024). CD200 has an additive negative impact on survival in patients with unfavorable cytogenetic (p = 0.046) and in secondary leukemia (p = 0.05), and is associate with a worsening of outcome in patients with favorable biological markers, such as mutated NPM (p = 0.02), wild-type Flt3 (p = 0.034), negativity of CD34 (p = 0.03) and of CD56 (p = 0.03).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational study of TB cases diagnosed by positive sputum microscopy in patients with cancer. Clinical information, evolution, and pathologic information of neoplasia was reviewed. RESULTS: 76 cases of active tuberculosis after being diagnosed with cancer were found. The median age was 51.3 years. Median follow-up was 2.1 years. The most common cancers were acute lymphocytic leukemia (14.5%), for the hematologic cancers; and cancer of the cervix (14.5%), breast (10.5%), and gastric (7.9%) for non-hematological cancers. 27.6% of patients had recurrence of the tumor; TB diagnosis confounded the initial staging by 6.9% and was initially stated as cancer recurrence in 11.1% (breast and colon cancers). The diagnosis of tuberculosis delayed or influenced the dose reduction of the antineoplastic treatment in 11.1% of the cases (acute lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma). 8.3% of patients had toxicity to the TB treatment.

Inhibitors of PI3Kdelta block BCR-mediated cross-talk between CLL cells and the lymph node microenvironment and provide significant clinical benefit to CLL patients. However, the PI3Kdelta inhibitors applied thus far have limited direct impact on leukemia cell survival and thus are unlikely to eradicate the disease. The use of inhibitors of multiple isoforms of PI3K might lead to deeper remissions. Here we demonstrate that the pan-PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor SAR245409 (voxtalisib/XL765) was more pro-apoptotic to CLL cells--irrespective of their ATM/p53 status--than PI3Kalpha or PI3Kdelta isoform selective inhibitors. Furthermore, SAR245409 blocked CLL survival, adhesion and proliferation. Moreover, SAR245409 was a more potent inhibitor of T-cell-mediated production of cytokines, which support CLL survival.

Epub 2015 Sep 4.,"The anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody SAR650984 (SAR) is showing promising clinical activity in treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Besides effector-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cytotoxicity, we here define molecular mechanisms of SAR-directed MM cell death and enhanced anti-MM activity triggered by SAR with Pomalidomide (Pom). Without Fc-cross-linking agents or effector cells, SAR specifically induces homotypic aggregation (HA)-associated cell death in MM cells dependent on the level of cell surface CD38 expression, actin cytoskeleton and membrane lipid raft. SAR and its F(ab)'2 fragments trigger caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis in MM cells highly expressing CD38, even with p53 mutation. Importantly, SAR specifically induces lysosome-dependent cell death (LCD) by enlarging lysosomes and increasing lysosomal membrane permeabilization associated with leakage of cathepsin B and LAMP-1, regardless of the presence of interleukin-6 or bone marrow stromal cells. Conversely, the lysosomal vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor blocks SAR-induced LCD. SAR further upregulates reactive oxygen species. Pom enhances SAR-induced direct and indirect killing even in MM cells resistant to Pom/Len. Taken together, SAR is the first therapeutic monoclonal antibody mediating direct cytotoxicity against MM cells via multiple mechanisms of action. Our data show that Pom augments both direct and effector cell-mediated MM cytotoxicity of SAR, providing the framework for combination clinical trials.","['P01-CA078378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01050947/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'R30772KCU0 (isatuximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of HDCA in bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (BMT/PBSCT), however, has not yet been elucidated. FINDINGS: We conducted a cohort study to compare the prognosis of HDCA/CY/TBI (N = 435) and CY/TBI (N = 1667) in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS using a Japanese transplant registry database. The median age was 38 years, and 86.0% of the patients had AML. Unrelated donors comprised 54.6%, and 63.9% of donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched. Overall survival (OS) was not improved in the HDCA/CY/TBI group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.14; p = 0.13). Neutrophil engraftment was inferior (HR, 0.80; p < 0.01), and the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis and thrombotic microangiopathy increased in HDCA/CY/TBI (HR, 1.47 and 1.60; p = 0.06 and 0.04, respectively), leading to significantly higher non-relapse mortality (NRM; HR, 1.48; p < 0.01). Post-transplant relapse and tumor-related mortality were not suppressed by the addition of HDCA. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated the inefficacy of HDCA/CY/TBI in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS.

We identify in these cells a novel DNA damage inducible form of phospho-Ku70. In vitro in different cancer cell lines, Ku70 phosphorylation occurs in a heterodimer Ku70/Ku80 complex within minutes of genotoxic stress, necessitating its interaction with DNA damage-induced kinase pS2056-DNA-PKcs and/or pS1981-ATM. The mutagenic effects of phospho-Ku70 are documented by a defective S/G2 checkpoint, accelerated disappearance of gamma-H2AX foci and kinetics of DNA repair resulting in an increased level of genotoxic stress-induced chromosomal aberrations.

Epub 2015 Sep 3.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by immune dysregulation, often including hypogammaglobulinemia, which contributes to a high rate of infections and morbidity. Ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), inhibits B-cell receptor signaling and is an effective, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment of CLL. Inactivating germline mutations in BTK cause a severe B-cell defect and agammaglobulinemia. Therefore, we assessed the impact of ibrutinib on immunoglobulin levels, normal B cells, and infection rate in patients with CLL treated with single-agent ibrutinib on a phase 2 investigator-initiated trial. Consistent with previous reports, immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels remained stable during the first 6 months on treatment, but decreased thereafter. In contrast, there were a transient increase in IgM and a sustained increase in IgA (median increase 45% at 12 months, P < .0001). To distinguish the effects on clonal B cells from normal B cells, we measured serum free light chains (FLCs). In kappa-clonal CLL cases, clonal (kappa) FLCs were elevated at baseline and normalized by 6 months. Nonclonal (lambda) FLCs, which were often depressed at baseline, increased, suggesting the recovery of normal B cells. Consistently, we observed normal B-cell precursors in the bone marrow and an increase in normal B-cell numbers in the peripheral blood. Patients with superior immune reconstitution, as defined by an increase in serum IgA of >/=50% from baseline to 12 months, had a significantly lower rate of infections (P = .03). These data indicate that ibrutinib allows for a clinically meaningful recovery of humoral immune function in patients with CLL.

Here we report that QKI plays an important role in the immune response and suppression of leukemogenesis. We show that the expression of Qki is reduced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged macrophages, suggesting that Qki is a key regulator of LPS signaling pathway. Furthermore, LPS-induced downregulation of Qki expression is miR-155-dependent. Qki overexpression impairs LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and particularly p38 MAPKs, in addition to increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In contrast, Qki ablation decreases Fas expression and the rate of Caspase3/7 activity, while increasing the levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6, and p38 phosphorylation. Similarly, the p38 pathway is also a target of QKI activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-derived MEC2 cells.

The rodent serum orthologue of human L-ficolin, ficolin-A, can bind to and opsonize Aspergillus fumigatus, the pathogen that causes invasive aspergillosis, and may participate in fungal defence. Using human monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils isolated from healthy donors, we investigated conidial association and fungal viability by flow cytometry and microscopy. Additionally, cytokine production was measured via cytometric bead arrays. Ficolin-A opsonization was observed to significantly enhance association of conidia, while also inhibiting hyphal growth and contributing to increased fungal killing following incubation with monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils. Additionally, ficolin-A opsonization was capable of manifesting a decrease in IL-8, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha production from MDM and IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha from neutrophils 24 h post-infection. In conclusion, rodent ficolin-A is functionally comparable to human L-ficolin and is capable of modulating the innate immune response to A. fumigatus, down-regulating cytokine production and could play an important role in airway immunity.",,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (ficolin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurocognitive late effects of chemotherapy occur in 40 - 60% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. These deficits affect mental health, school performance, job success, and are associated with poor quality of life, therefore presenting a clinical challenge for psychiatrists. However, not all cancer survivors are impacted by treatment in the same manner and emerging evidence suggests that genetic variation may modulate neurocognitive outcomes. Much like other complex psychopathologies, neurocognitive deficits in cancer survivors are the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental variables. This review describes adverse neurocognitive outcomes observed in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and discusses genetic variability in biochemical pathways targeted by chemotherapeutic agents as a possible mechanism contributing to psychopathology in ALL survivors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used an FSH-induced co-dominance model to determine the effect of FSH on signalling pathways in granulosa cells of the second-largest follicles (SF in control cows and co-dominant follicle (co-DF2) in FSH-treated cows). The SF was smaller than DF in control cows while diameters of co-DF1 and co-DF2 in FSH-treated cows were similar. The presence of cleaved CASP3 protein confirmed that granulosa cells of SFs, but not of DFs and co-DFs, were apoptotic. To determine the effect of FSH on molecular characteristics of the second-largest follicles, we generated relative variables for the second largest follicle in each cow. For this, variables of SF or co-DF2 were divided by the variables of the largest follicle DF or co-DF1 in each cow. There was higher transcript abundance of MAPK1/3 and AKT1/2/3 but lower abundance of phosphorylated MAPK3/1 in SF than co-DF2 granulosa cells. Abundance of mRNA and phosphorylated protein of STAT3 was higher in granulosa cells of control SF than FSH-treated co-DF2. SF granulosa cells had higher levels of LIFR and IL6ST transcripts, the two receptors involved in STAT3 activation. Further, lower transcript abundance of interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R), another receptor involved in STAT3 activation, indicated that STAT3 activation in SF granulosa cells could be mainly due to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signalling. These results indicate that atresia due to lack of FSH is associated with activated LIF-STAT3 signalling in SF granulosa cells, as FSH treatment reversed such activation.",,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,['(c) 2015 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, we found that low-level of benzene exposure down-regulated the expression of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP1). Here, we employed RNA interference to knock down PARP1 expression in TK6 cells and explored the potential role of PARP1 in HQ-induced cytotoxicity. The results showed that stable PARP1-knockdown cells were successfully constructed and more than 80% inhibition of PARP1 expression was confirmed. We found that HQ treatment of TK6 cells decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, and caspase3/7 activity. Knockdown of PARP1 in HQ-treated TK6 cells prevented caspase3 activation, and increased apoptosis than that in the wild-type TK6 cells, with fully functional PARP1. The results also showed that down-regulation of PARP1 led to a decrease in cell proliferation and an enhanced susceptibility to HQ-induced cytotoxicity with concentration less than 40 muM than that in normal TK6 cells. Moreover, PARP1-knockdown TK6 cells treated with HQ displayed an increased level of DNA double-strand breaks as measured by olive tail moment. No evidence was obtained of an effect of PARP1 depletion on H2AX phosphorylation induction.

Herein, this study aimed at evaluating the cellular toxicity, antiproliferative activity and effects on cell cycle progression of free InsP6 and InsP6-Ni(II) of leukemic T (Jurkat) and normal human cells. Treatments with InsP6 at concentrations between 1.0 and 4.0mM significantly decreased the viability of Jurkat cells, but showed no cytotoxic effect on normal human lymphocytes. Treatment with InsP6-Ni(II) complex at concentrations between 0.05 and 0.30 mM showed an anti-proliferative dose and a time-dependent effect, with significantly reduced cell viability of Jurkat cells but showed no cytotoxic effect on normal human lymphocytes as compared to the control. Ni(II) free ion was toxic to normal cells while InsP6-Ni(II) had no cytotoxic effect. The InsP6-Ni(II) complex potentiated (up to 10x) the antiproliferative effect of free InsP6 on Jurkat cells. The cytometric flow assay showed that InsP6 led to an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells in S and G2/M phases, whereas InsP6-Ni(II) has led to an accumulation of cells in the S and G2/M phases.

Standard treatment causes many side effects, such as depletion of bone marrow cells, skin rashes and gastrointestinal implications. Therefore, it is necessary to find chemotherapeutic alternatives for the treatment of this disease. It was shown that a naphthoquinone derivative compound is active against T. gondii, RH strain, with an IC50 around 2.5 muM. Here, three different naphthoquinone derivative compounds with activity against leukemia cells and breast carcinoma cell were tested against T. gondii (RH strain) infected LLC-MK2 cell line. All the compounds were able to inhibit parasite growth in vitro, but one of them showed an IC50 activity below 1 muM after 48 h of treatment. The compounds showed low toxicity to the host cell. In addition, these compounds were able to induce tachyzoite-bradyzoite conversion confirmed by morphological changes, Dolichus biflorus lectin cyst wall labeling and characterization of amylopectin granules in the parasites by electron microscopy analysis using the Thierry technique. Furthermore, the compounds induced alterations on the ultrastructure of the parasite. Taken together, our results point to the naphthoquinone derivative (LQB 151) as a potential compound for the development of new drugs for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.",,"['0 (Antiprotozoal Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Several groups have simultaneously reported robust response rates in children and adults alike. These early studies indicate an impending shift in paradigm for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Incorporating CD19 CAR T-cell therapy into upfront or salvage regimens has its challenges and opportunities. RECENT FINDINGS: Most CD19 CAR T-cell products in trial today are excellent at inducing minimal residual disease negative remissions, and most responding patients experience cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity. The challenges facing the CAR community involve how best to minimize the severity of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity while maximizing antitumor efficacy, determining what role this therapy will play for the prophylaxis and treatment of central nervous system leukemia, and its implications on subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplant given the emergence of CD19-negative relapses.

Although it is widely accepted that immunological components of the stem cell graft play a critical role in promoting leukemia eradication (graft versus leukemia effect), it is also evident that their efficacy is frequently inadequate and leukemia relapse still occurs. This article reviews recent insights into T cell-based posttransplant immunotherapy approaches aimed at preventing or controlling leukemia relapse. RECENT FINDINGS: Donor lymphocyte infusion with T cells genetically modified with safety switches improves the patient's immune reconstitution while offering appropriate control of graft versus host disease. T lymphocytes engineered with artificial tumor-specific receptors such as alphabetaT-cell receptor chains or chimeric antigen receptors are major players in promoting antileukemia effects after allogeneic HSCT. SUMMARY: The landscape of adoptive T cell therapies after allogeneic HSCT has seen significant achievements with the introduction of T cell engineering. Gene transfer grants the generation of T cell products characterized by standardizable specificity and functionality. This aspect is critical for scalable and reproducible approaches for application in large clinical studies. The clinical results so far reported are encouraging and multicenter studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies will provide definitive conclusions on the clinical impact of these new methodologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 3.,"PURPOSE: The most common cause of treatment failure in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the relapse. Genetic polymorphisms of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme affect the response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment. Inter-individual variability exists in the distribution of DHFR variants, and they influence MTX treatment outcome. To the best of our knowledge, there are no genetic studies reported from India, which have explored the influence of DHFR variants on the outcome of MTX treatment. Therefore, we aim to study the influence of DHFR rs408626 (-317A>G) and rs442767 (-680C>A) variants on ALL outcome in South Indian patients. METHODS: A total of 70 ALL patients who were on MTX-based maintenance therapy were recruited for the study. DNA was extracted from leukocytes, and genotyping was done by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The DHFR-317GG genotype was associated with the increased risk of relapse in patients with ALL (relative risk 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38 to 3.6, p = 0.02). DHFR-317AA and -680CA genotypes were found to be associated with severe leucopenia (p < 0.05). In Cox regression model, -317GG genotype was found to have lower relapse-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 2.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.19, p = 0.03) and overall survival (HR 3.72, 95% CI 1.44 to 9.65, p = 0.007). Similarly, patients with white blood cell (WBC) count >50,000 cells/mm(3) were also found to have lower relapse-free survival (HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.79, p = 0.04) and overall survival (HR 3.30, 95% CI 1.45 to 7.53, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The GG genotype of DHFR-317A>G variant is associated with increased risk of ALL relapse and lower overall survival in South Indian population. Both variants of DHFR (-317 AA and -680 CA) are found to be associated with severe leucopenia caused by MTX.",,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who are not eligible to receive a transplant can be treated with hypomethylating agents that have shown to improve disease-free and overall survival. OBJECTIVE: Retrospective description of the clinical characteristics of patients suffering from advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia that were treated with a hypomethylating agent as well as its adverse effects and response to treatment. METHODS: This report shows our experience in 38 patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with azacitidine or palliative treatment. RESULTS: Azacitidine was able to prolong survival in 80% of patients with a high incidence of adverse effects and negative impact on quality of life. Most of the patients treated with palliative intent died in the first month after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine can prolong survival but with significant adverse effects.

After neurological examination a multifocal lesion in the central nervous system was suspected with the most pronounced lesions between the third thoracic and the third lumbar vertebrae. Haematological examination revealed moderate anaemia as well as severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leucocytosis. A blood smear and bone marrow aspirate exhibited predominantly blasts with basophilic granulation leading to a diagnosis of acute (myeloid) leukaemia with involvement of the basophilic lineage or an acute basophilic leukaemia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed spinal cord compression; at necropsy, extensive localised haemorrhages extending into the thoracic vertebral canal were found. Histopathology revealed a large population of blast cells in several tissues including the meninges. Due to multifocal detection of neoplastic cells in the vascular system, neoplasia of the haematopoietic system was assumed in agreement with haematological findings.

The interpretation of the quantitative phase images of living cells remains a difficult task because (1) we still have very little knowledge on the impact of its internal macromolecular complexes on the local RI and (2) phase changes produced by light propagation through the sample are mixed with diffraction effects by the internal cell bodies. We propose to implement a two-dimensional wavelet-based contour chain detection method to distinguish internal boundaries based on their greatest optical path difference gradients. These contour chains correspond to the highest image phase contrast and follow the local RI inhomogeneities linked to the intracellular structural intricacy. Their statistics and spatial distribution are the morphological indicators suited for comparing cells of different origins and/or to follow their transformation in pathologic situations. We use this method to compare nonadherent blood cells from primary and laboratory culture origins and to assess the internal transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by the transduction of the BCR-ABL oncogene responsible for the chronic myelogenous leukemia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the basis of this deficit, we sought to assess the environmental history-taking behavior and perceptions of environmental health among pediatric hematologists and oncologists. PROCEDURE: A web-based survey was sent from June to October 2012 to 427 pediatric oncologists, fellows, and nurse practitioners from 20 US institutions, with an overall response rate of 45%. RESULTS: Survey responses indicated that environmental exposures are of concern to clinicians. The vast majority of respondents (88%) reported receiving questions from families about the relationship between certain environmental exposures and the cancers they regularly treat. However, a lack of comfort with these topics seems to have limited their discussions with families about the role of environmental exposures in childhood cancer pathogenesis. Although 77% of respondents suspected that some of the cases they saw had an environmental origin, their methods of taking environmental histories varied widely. Over 90% of respondents believed that more knowledge of the associations between environmental exposures and childhood cancer would be helpful in addressing these issues with patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited in size and representativeness of participating institutions, the results of this survey indicate a need for increased training for hematology/oncology clinicians about environmental health exposures related to cancer and prompt translation of emerging research findings in biomedical journals that clinicians read.","['U61 TS000238/TS/ATSDR CDC HHS/United States', '1P01ES018172-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'U61TS000238-01/TS/ATSDR CDC HHS/United States', 'P50 ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NIHMS710828'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 1.,"The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment regulates the properties of healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) localized in specific niches. Two distinct microenvironmental niches have been identified in the BM, the ""osteoblastic (endosteal)"" and ""vascular"" niches. Nevertheless, these niches provide sanctuaries where subsets of leukemic cells escape chemotherapy-induced death and acquire a drug-resistant phenotype. Moreover, it is emerging that leukemia cells are able to remodel the BM niches into malignant niches which better support neoplastic cell survival and proliferation. This review focuses on the cellular and molecular biology of microenvironment/leukemia interactions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of both B- and T-cell lineage. We shall also highlight the emerging role of exosomes/microvesicles as efficient messengers for cell-to-cell communication in leukemia settings. Studies on the interactions between the BM microenvironment and ALL cells have led to the discovery of potential therapeutic targets which include cytokines/chemokines and their receptors, adhesion molecules, signal transduction pathways, and hypoxia-related proteins. The complex interplays between leukemic cells and BM microenvironment components provide a rationale for innovative, molecularly targeted therapies, designed to improve ALL patient outcome. A better understanding of the contribution of the BM microenvironment to the process of leukemogenesis and leukemia persistence after initial remission, may provide new targets that will allow destruction of leukemia cells without adversely affecting healthy HSCs.

Epub 2015 Oct 20.,"BACKGROUND: RhoA is an important regulator of platelet responses downstream of Galpha13 , yet we still know little about its regulation in platelets. Leukemia-associated Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF [LARG]), a RhoA GEF, is highly expressed in platelets and may constitute a major upstream activator of RhoA. To this end, it is important to determine the role of LARG in platelet function and thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a platelet-specific gene knockout, we show that the absence of LARG results in a marked reduction in aggregation and dense-granule secretion in response to the thromboxane mimetic U46619 and proteinase-activated receptor 4-activating peptide, AYPGKF, but not to adenosine diphosphate. In a ferric chloride thrombosis model in vivo, this translated into a defect, under mild injury conditions. Importantly, agonist-induced RhoA activation was not affected by the absence of LARG, although basal activity was reduced, suggesting that LARG may play a housekeeper role in regulating constitutive RhoA activity. CONCLUSIONS: LARG plays an important role in platelet function and thrombosis in vivo. However, although LARG may have a role in regulating the resting activation state of RhoA, its role in regulating platelet function may principally be through RhoA-independent pathways, possibly through other Rho family members.","['PG/13/14/30023/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'RG/10/006/28299/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'WT090093MA/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (alanyl-tyrosyl-prolyl-glycyl-lysyl-phenylalanine)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '76898-47-0 (15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (RhoA protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'U38V3ZVV3V (ferric chloride)']",,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Treatment for T-ALL is heavily dependent upon antimetabolite chemotherapeutics, including cytarabine. Targeted inhibition of WEE1 with AZD1775 has emerged as a strategy to sensitize cancer cells to cytarabine and other chemotherapeutics. We sought to determine if this strategy would be effective for T-ALL with clinically relevant anti-leukemia agents. We found that AZD1775 sensitizes T-ALL cells to several traditional anti-leukemia agents, acting synergistically with cytarabine by enhancing DNA damage and apoptosis. In addition to increased phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139 (gammaH2AX), AZD1775 led to increased phosphorylation of H2AX at tyrosine 142, a signaling event associated with promotion of apoptosis over DNA repair. In a xenograft model of T-ALL, the addition of AZD1775 to cytarabine slowed leukemia progression and prolonged survival. Inhibition of WEE1 with AZD1775 sensitizes T-ALL to several anti-leukemia agents, particularly cytarabine and that mechanistically, AZD1775 promotes apoptosis over DNA repair in cells treated with cytarabine. These data support the development of clinical trials including AZD1775 in combination with conventional chemotherapy for acute leukemia.","['R01 CA172385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA082086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA082086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA172385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'K2T6HJX3I3 (adavosertib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Active and repressive marks of histone methylation dictate the embryonic expression boundaries of developmentally regulated genes, including the Hox gene cluster. Drosophila ash1 (absent, small or homeotic discs 1) gene encodes a histone methyltransferase essential for regulation of Hox gene expression that interacts genetically with other members of the trithorax group (TrxG). While mammalian members of the mixed lineage leukemia (Mll) family of TrxG genes have roles in regulation of Hox gene expression, little is known about the expression and function of the mammalian ortholog of the Drosophila ash1 gene, Ash1-like (Ash1l). Here we report the expression of mouse Ash1l gene in specific structures within various organs and provide evidence that reduced Ash1l expression has tissue-specific effects on mammalian development and adult homeostasis. Mutants exhibit partially penetrant postnatal lethality and failure to thrive. Surviving mutants have growth insufficiency, skeletal transformations, and infertility associated with developmental defects in both male and female reproductive organs. Specifically, expression of Hoxa11 and Hoxd10 are altered in the epididymis of Ash1l mutant males and Hoxa10 is reduced in the uterus of Ash1l mutant females. In summary, we show that the histone methyltransferase Ash1l is important for the development and function of several tissues and for proper expression of homeotic genes in mammals.","['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-HD30428-19/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD007505/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HD030428/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (ASH1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,"['(c) 2015 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported preliminary results on three patients with refractory CLL. We report the mature results from our initial trial using CAR-modified T cells to treat 14 patients with relapsed and refractory CLL. Autologous T cells transduced with a CD19-directed CAR (CTL019) lentiviral vector were infused into patients with relapsed/refractory CLL at doses of 0.14 x 10(8) to 11 x 10(8) CTL019 cells (median, 1.6 x 10(8) cells). Patients were monitored for toxicity, response, expansion, and persistence of circulating CTL019 T cells. The overall response rate in these heavily pretreated CLL patients was 8 of 14 (57%), with 4 complete remissions (CR) and 4 partial remissions (PR). The in vivo expansion of the CAR T cells correlated with clinical responses, and the CAR T cells persisted and remained functional beyond 4 years in the first two patients achieving CR. No patient in CR has relapsed. All responding patients developed B cell aplasia and experienced cytokine release syndrome, coincident with T cell proliferation. Minimal residual disease was not detectable in patients who achieved CR, suggesting that disease eradication may be possible in some patients with advanced CLL.","['1R01CA165206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K24 CA117879/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA165206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (CTL019 chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']",,,['NIHMS958772'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recurrent chromosomal abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia is the reciprocal translocation t(8;21) that fuses RUNX1 and ETO genes. We report here that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling increases the expression of ETO and RUNX1 genes in human hematopoietic progenitors. We found that beta-catenin is rapidly recruited into RNA polymerase II transcription factories (RNAPII-Ser5) and that ETO and RUNX1 genes are brought into close spatial proximity upon Wnt3a induction. Notably, long-term treatment of cells with Wnt3a induces the generation a frequent RUNX1-ETO translocation event. Thus, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling induces transcription and translocation of RUNX1 and ETO fusion gene partners, opening a novel window to understand the onset/development of leukemia.",['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the potential of curcumin to reverse promoter methylation of the p15 gene in Raji cells and its ability to induce apoptosis and genomic instability. Anti-neoplastic action of curcumin showed an augmentation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Subsequently, curcumin- exposed Raji cells showed structural abnormalities in chromosomes. These observations suggest that curcumin also causes ROS-mediated apoptosis and genomic instability. The treatment of Raji cell line with 10 muM curcumin caused hypomethylation of the p15 promoter after six days. Hypomethylation of p15 was further found to be favoured by downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 after 10 muM curcumin treatment for six days. Methylation-specific PCR suggested demethylation of the p15 promoter. Demethylation was further validated by DNA sequencing. Reverse-transcription PCR demonstrated that treatment with curcumin (10 muM) for six days led to the up-regulation of p15 and down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1. Furthermore, curcumin- mediated reversal of p15 promoter methylation might be potentiated by down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 expression, which was supported by cell cycle analysis. Furthermore, curcumin acts as a double-pronged agent, as it caused apoptosis and promoter hypomethylation in Raji cells.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine whether the presence of BLV DNA in human mammary epithelium is associated with breast cancer.

Case definition as breast cancer versus normal (women with no history of breast cancer) was established through medical records and examination of tissues by an anatomical pathologist. Breast exposure to BLV was determined by in situ-PCR detection of a biomarker, BLV DNA, localized within mammary epithelium. RESULTS: The frequency of BLV DNA in mammary epithelium from women with breast cancer (59%) was significantly higher than in normal controls (29%) (multiply- adjusted odds ratio = 3.07, confidence interval = 1.66-5.69, p = .0004, attributable risk = 37%). In women with premalignant breast changes the frequency of BLV DNA was intermediate (38%) between that of women with breast cancer and normal controls (p for trend < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Among the specimens in this study, the presence of amplified BLV DNA was significantly associated with breast cancer. The odds ratio magnitude was comparable to those of well-established breast cancer risk factors related to reproductive history, hormones, and lifestyle and was exceeded only by risk factors related to genetics (familial breast cancer), high dose ionizing radiation, and age. These findings have the potential for primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.",,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 11.,"Because of the pressure of significant attrition in drug development, demonstration of target engagement after drug administration enables dose and regimen optimization, patient selection, and stratification from the earliest stages of drug development. The determination of receptor occupancy (RO) can support these efforts. Flow cytometry is one of the preferred technologies to be used based on the important advances in the technology over the last years enabling the simultaneous determination on target cells, of multi intra or surface cell parameters with adequate precision in a regulated environment. Nevertheless, compared to other platforms using the same antigen-antibody binding concept, the flow cytometry approach has faced several challenges, not only due to the technology per se and the diversity of receptor occupancy approaches, but also related to the nature of the matrix where the determination is performed. To illustrate these points, three case studies (antibody-drug conjugate and naked antibody) are provided here to highlight the importance of the choice of the right antibody pair to measure both receptor density (RD) and occupancy by the drug on cancer cells in blood and in bone marrow and the possibility to circumvent the lack of a critical reagent with an innovative approach. In addition, the use of RO data to determine the minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) with translational data from preclinical to human studies, selection of starting dose for the first in man study will be discussed.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",,['(c) 2015 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive malignant B-cell disorder that often presents with a leukemic picture. Circulating lymphoma cell morphology may vary from small round mature-appearing lymphocytes resembling the lymphocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia to large prolymphocytoid or blastoid cells. Rare reports of hyperleukocytosis with leukostasis, treated with leukocytapheresis, are described in patients with prolymphocytoid or blastoid morphology. We report an 88 year old woman with mantle cell lymphoma, hyperleukocytosis (WBC > 400 x 10(3) /microL) with severe respiratory compromise but without interstitial or alveolar infiltrates on radiograph or computerized tomography of the chest. She was afebrile and had no central nervous system signs. Circulating lymphoma cell morphology was predominantly of the small lymphocyte type. A two-whole-blood-volume leukocytapheresis reduced her WBC from 465 to 221 x 10(3) /microL in 150 min. Her respiratory rate decreased from 28/min to 18/min and her arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) rose from 91% to 97% on 6 L/min of oxygen by nasal cannula. Severe breathlessness before the procedure abated completely by the end of the procedure. Respiratory compromise may occur in mantle cell lymphoma with hyperleukocytosis with a mature lymphoma cell phenotype, even without a clear picture of leukostasis. Although the ultimate survival of the patient depends on treatment with chemotherapy, leukocytapheresis for alleviation of symptoms may be warranted and should be considered. Respiratory status and response to leukocytapheresis should be documented with physiological measurements. J. Clin. Apheresis 31:398-402, 2016.

It has been shown to inhibit megakaryocytic proliferation in vitro in cells obtained from patients with essential thrombocythemia. In this phase 2 study, we investigated whether imetelstat could elicit hematologic and molecular responses in patients with essential thrombocythemia who had not had a response to or who had had unacceptable side effects from prior therapies. METHODS: A total of 18 patients in two sequential cohorts received an initial dose of 7.5 or 9.4 mg of imetelstat per kilogram of body weight intravenously once a week until attainment of a platelet count of approximately 250,000 to 300,000 per cubic millimeter. The primary end point was the best hematologic response. RESULTS: Imetelstat induced hematologic responses in all 18 patients, and 16 patients (89%) had a complete hematologic response. At the time of the primary analysis, 10 patients were still receiving treatment, with a median follow-up of 17 months (range, 7 to 32 [ongoing]). Molecular responses were seen in 7 of 8 patients who were positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation (88%; 95% confidence interval, 47 to 100). CALR and MPL mutant allele burdens were also reduced by 15 to 66%. The most common adverse events during treatment were mild to moderate in severity; neutropenia of grade 3 or higher occurred in 4 of the 18 patients (22%) and anemia, headache, and syncope of grade 3 or higher each occurred in 2 patients (11%). All the patients had at least one abnormal liver-function value; all persistent elevations were grade 1 or 2 in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and durable hematologic and molecular responses were observed in patients with essential thrombocythemia who received imetelstat.

Epub 2015 Nov 6.,"The management of patients with CLL is undergoing significant changes; during the last decade, the outcome of first-line therapies has been markedly improved with the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies to chemotherapy. Today, chemoimmunotherapy for physically fit patients </= 65 years should consist of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). The combination of bendamustine and rituximab (BR) should be considered in physically fit patients > 65 years and in patients with a higher risk of infections. Patients with reduced fitness and/or relevant comorbidity should receive chlorambucil with a CD20 antibody, preferably obinutuzumab. Regardless of their fitness, patients with CLL carrying genetic aberrations such as del(17p) and/or TP53 mutation poorly respond to chemoimmunotherapy and therefore require different therapeutic approaches. An increasing understanding of the disease biology has led to the development of targeted drugs for the treatment of CLL, such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and PI3K inhibitor idelalisib. These agents have shown efficacy in high-risk and relapsed/refractory patients and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for first-line therapy.

Over a 6-month period of clinical testing with a targeted next-generation sequencing assay, we evaluated 92 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and identified a subset of 21 patients (23%) who harbored mutations in either IDH1 or IDH2. Of the 21 patients with IDH mutations, 4 (19%) were found to have single nucleotide variants in both IDH1 and IDH2. An additional patient included in the study was found to have two different IDH2 mutations. The mutations were typically present at different variant allelic frequencies, with one predominating over the other, consistent with the presence of multiple subclones in a single patient. In one case, the variant allelic frequencies in both IDH1 and IDH2 were equally low in the setting of a high percentage of blasts, suggesting that the IDH mutations were unlikely to be present in the founding clone. Given these data, we conclude that dual IDH1/2 mutations likely were previously underestimated, a finding that may carry important treatment implications.","['T32 CA071345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA 71345-18/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Postoperative aqueous flare was significantly greater in the manual cataract surgery group at 1 day (p<0.001), 7 days (p<0.001) and 30 days (p = 0.002).No correlation was found between the analyzed mediators and the aqueous flare values. CONCLUSIONS: The expression profiles of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors and the correlations of these profiles with the in vivo inflammatory indexes for patients undergoing cataract surgery with femtosecond laser pretreatment were identified. Our data indicate a disturbance of postoperative inflammation response after femtosecond laser treatment.",,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Oct 16.,"L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) is an important branch of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma. Although it mediates hydrolysis of asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln), which are variably required for cancer cell survival, the relative contribution of Asn and Gln depletion to the anti-tumor activity in therapeutic doses is unclear in ALL and malignant lymphoma. Here we demonstrate that L-ASNase exerts cytotoxicity through targeting the Gln addiction phenotype in lymphoid cell lines. A clinically attainable intermediate dose of L-ASNase induced massive apoptosis in ALL Jurkat and mantle cell lymphoma Jeko cell lines, while a low dose of L-ASNase effectively killed NK-cell lymphoma cells. In the lymphoid cell lines Jurkat and Jeco, deprivation of Gln but not Asn specifically suppressed cell growth and survival, and phenocopied the action of L-ASNase. L-ASNase treatment and Gln deprivation dramatically disrupted the refilling of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by intracellular glutamate (Glu) and disturbed the mitochondrial integrity, which were alleviated by various anaplerotic TCA cycle intermediates, suggesting a direct contribution of glutaminase activity of L-ASNase. The action of L-ASNase differs between Jurkat cells and NK-cell lymphoma cells, according to their dependence on Gln and Asn. Furthermore, we observed that high expression of glutaminase GLS1 is associated with increased sensivity to L-ASNase in pediatric B lineage ALL. Our results redefine L-ASNase as a therapeutic agent targeting Gln addiction in certain lymphoid cells and offer an additional basis for predicting L-ASNase sensitivity and engineering selective L-ASNase derivatives for leukemia and lymphoma.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Epub 2015 Sep 2.,"Whether cancer is maintained by a small number of stem cells or is composed of proliferating cells with approximate phenotypic equivalency is a central question in cancer biology. In the stem cell hypothesis, relapse after treatment may occur by failure to eradicate cancer stem cells. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is quintessential to this hypothesis. CML is a myeloproliferative disorder that results from dysregulated tyrosine kinase activity of the fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL. During the chronic phase, this sole genetic abnormality (chromosomal translocation Ph(+): t(9;22)(q34;q11)) at the stem cell level causes increased proliferation of myeloid cells without loss of their capacity to differentiate. Without treatment, most patients progress to the blast phase when additional oncogenic mutations result in a fatal acute leukaemia made of proliferating immature cells. Imatinib mesylate and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the kinase activity of BCR-ABL have improved patient survival markedly. However, fewer than 10% of patients reach the stage of complete molecular response (CMR), defined as the point when BCR-ABL transcripts become undetectable in blood cells. Failure to reach CMR results from the inability of TKIs to eradicate quiescent CML leukaemia stem cells (LSCs). Here we show that the residual CML LSC pool can be gradually purged by the glitazones, antidiabetic drugs that are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). We found that activation of PPARgamma by the glitazones decreases expression of STAT5 and its downstream targets HIF2alpha and CITED2, which are key guardians of the quiescence and stemness of CML LSCs. When pioglitazone was given temporarily to three CML patients in chronic residual disease in spite of continuous treatment with imatinib, all of them achieved sustained CMR, up to 4.7 years after withdrawal of pioglitazone. This suggests that clinically relevant cancer eradication may become a generally attainable goal by combination therapy that erodes the cancer stem cell pool.",,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CITED2 protein, human)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'X4OV71U42S (Pioglitazone)']","['Nature. 2015 Sep 17;525(7569):328-9.

Prevalent p53 missense mutations abrogate its tumour suppressive function and lead to a 'gain-of-function' (GOF) that promotes cancer. Here we show that p53 GOF mutants bind to and upregulate chromatin regulatory genes, including the methyltransferases MLL1 (also known as KMT2A), MLL2 (also known as KMT2D), and acetyltransferase MOZ (also known as KAT6A or MYST3), resulting in genome-wide increases of histone methylation and acetylation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas shows specific upregulation of MLL1, MLL2, and MOZ in p53 GOF patient-derived tumours, but not in wild-type p53 or p53 null tumours. Cancer cell proliferation is markedly lowered by genetic knockdown of MLL1 or by pharmacological inhibition of the MLL1 methyltransferase complex. Our study reveals a novel chromatin mechanism underlying the progression of tumours with GOF p53, and suggests new possibilities for designing combinatorial chromatin-based therapies for treating individual cancers driven by prevalent GOF p53 mutations.","['092809/Z/10/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES013508/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']","['Nature. 2015 Sep 10;525(7568):199-200.

There has been a recent interest in using ASP in adults with ALL, particularly the less toxic pegylated (PEG) formulation. Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a rare complication of PEG-ASP therapy. We report two cases of obese patients who developed severe HTG after receiving PEG for ALL. Both patients were incidentally found to have severe HTG (TG of 4,330 and 4,420 mg/dL). In both patients, there was no personal or family history of dyslipidemia or hypothyroidism. There was no evidence of pancreatitis or skin manifestations of HTG. Both patients were treated with PEG cessation, low-fat diet and pharmacotherapy. Both patients were re-challenged with PEG, with subsequent increase in TG but no associated complications. TG returned to baseline after discontinuing PEG and while on therapy for HTG. A literature review of PEG-induced HTG in adults demonstrated similar results: asymptomatic presentation despite very severe HTG. HTG is a rare but clinically important adverse effect of PEG.

This case describes an unusual presentation of isolated MS in a 60-year-old otherwise healthy male, who initially presented to his primary care physician with vague abdominal pain. After extensive workup including three omental biopsies, umbilical core biopsy, and inguinal lymph node biopsy, he was ultimately diagnosed with isolated MS with extensive extramedullary tumor burden. Despite advanced extramedullary disease, peripheral cell counts were normal and bilateral bone marrow biopsies unremarkable with normal cellular lineages, morphology, and cytogenetics. The patient underwent induction chemotherapy and is now greater than 100 days post myeloablative unrelated donor marrow transplantation with no evidence of disease recurrence and 100% donor status with full chimerism. This case demonstrates that making a prompt diagnosis with rapid initiation of treatment in myeloid sarcoma can be challenging due to its varied clinical presentation, cytomorphology, cytochemistry, and cytogenetic overlap with other lymphoid malignancies. Once a diagnosis of MS has been made, moving quickly to induction therapy is important. Several studies have shown that improved overall survival is attained when MS is treated as acute myeloid leukemia and increased survival is noted for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate the many remaining questions in regards to the natural history, prognosis, and optimal treatment strategies for this deadly disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At cell surfaces, A2 forms the (A2*S100A10)2 complex which accelerates tissue plasminogen activator-dependent activation of the fibrinolytic protease, plasmin. Anti-A2 antibodies are associated with clinical thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome, whereas overexpression of A2 promotes hyperfibrinolytic bleeding in acute promyelocytic leukemia. A2 is upregulated in hypoxic tissues, and mice deficient in A2 are resistant to hypoxia-related retinal neovascularization in a model of diabetic retinopathy. Within the cell, A2 regulates membrane fusion processes involved in the secretion of pre-packaged, ultra-large molecules. In stimulated dendritic cells, A2 maintains lysosomal membrane integrity, thereby modulating inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion. Together, these findings suggest an emerging, multifaceted role for annexin A2 in human health and disease.

Epub 2015 Sep 1.,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an essential regulator of cancer promotion and progression. Extensive efforts to target this enzyme have been developed to reduce growth of cancer cells for chemopreventive and therapeutic reasons. In this context, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors present interesting antitumor effects. However, inhibition of COX-2 by anti-COX-2 compounds such as celecoxib was recently associated with detrimental cardiovascular side effects limiting their clinical use. As many anticancer effects of celecoxib are COX-2 independent, analogs such as 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC), which lacks COX-2-inhibitory activity, represent a promising alternative strategy. In this study, we investigated the effect of this molecule on growth of hematologic cancer cell lines (U937, Jurkat, Hel, Raji, and K562). We found that this molecule is able to reduce the growth and induces apoptosis more efficiently than celecoxib in all the leukemic cell lines tested. Cell death was associated with downregulation of Mcl-1 protein expression. We also found that DMC induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which is associated with a decreased of GRP78 protein expression and an alteration of cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition in U937 cells. Accordingly, typical downregulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1 and an upregulation of p27 were observed. Interestingly, for shorter time points, an alteration of mitotic progression, associated with the downregulation of survivin protein expression was observed. Altogether, our data provide new evidence about the mode of action of this compound on hematologic malignancies.",,"['0 (2,5-dimethylcelecoxib)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']",,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0115-4725'],,,,,,,,

Paradigmatic examples include the development of lymphoma in Sjogren's syndrome and Hashimoto thyroiditis, gastric MALT lymphoma in Helicobacter pylori infection, or lymphomas associated with infections by Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 8 (HHV 8) and leukemia/lymphoma virus 1 (HTLV-1). A growing number of reports indicates an increased risk of lymphoma, particularly of the anaplastic large cell (ALCL) type. The implants, specifically those used in the past, elicit chronic stimulation of the immune system against the prosthetic material. This is particularly the case in genetically susceptible hosts. We suggest that polyclonal activation may result in monoclonality in those at risk hosts, ultimately leading to lymphoma. We suggest that patients with an inflammatory response against silicone implants be monitored carefully.",,"['0 (Silicone Gels)', 'Familial primary gastric lymphoma']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to address the question ""Is there a higher cancer incidence rate in the vicinity of nuclear power plants in Taiwan?"" The Taiwan Cancer Registry database from 1979 to 2003 was used to compare the standardized incidence rate of the top four cancers with strong evidence for radiation risks between the ""plant-vicinity"" with those ""non-plant-vicinity"" groups. All cancer sites, five-leading cancers in Taiwan, and gender-specific cancers were also studied. We also adopted different observation time to compare the incidence rate of cancers between two groups to explore the impact of the observation period. The incidences of leukemia, thyroid, lung, and breast cancer were not significantly different between two groups, but cervix uteri cancer showed higher incidence rates in the plant-vicinity group.

Immunomodulatory cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-35, soluble factors, such as adenosine, immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells, NKT cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are the main orchestra leaders involved in immune suppression in cancer by which tumor cells can freely expand without immune cell-mediated interference. Among them, MDSCs have attracted much attention as they represent a heterogenous population derived from myeloid progenitors that are expanded in tumor condition and can also shift toward other myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, after tumor clearing. MDSCs exert their immunosuppressive effects through various immune and non-immune mechanisms which make them as potent tumor-promoting cells. Although, there are several studies regarding the immunobiology of MDSCs in different solid tumors, little is known about the precise characteristics of these cells in hematological malignancies, particularly B cell malignancies. In this review, we tried to clarify the precise role of MDSCs in B cell-derived malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effect of Hypmediated photodynamic therapy (HypPDT) on cell growth and apoptosis of K562 leukemia cells, and to examine the underlying mechanisms. HypPDT was performed with different light intensities (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mW/cm2), different concentrations of Hyp (0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 microg/ml) and different durations of irradiation (0, 2, 4 and 8 min) in order to select the optimal conditions for subsequent experiments. A concentration of 0.4 microg/ml Hyp with a 5 h druglight interval and 4 min irradiation at 0.3 mW/cm2 light intensity was selected as the optimal conditions. The effects of HypPDT on apoptosis were determined by detecting morphological changes under microscopy and by performing western blot analysis. The results revealed that HypPDT suppressed cell viability in a light intensity, dose and irradiation durationdependent manner. The expression levels of cleaved caspase9, cleaved caspase3 and phosphorylatedCJun N terminal kinase (JNK)l were significantly upregulated following HypPDT. These results indicated that HypPDT decreased cell viability and induced mitochondriacaspasedependent apoptosis in the K562 cells through regulation of the JNK pathway. These findings suggest that Hyp-PDT may be developed as an effective treatment for leukemia.",,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 2.,"INTRODUCTION: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare subtype of B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia. It is characterized by progressive pancytopenia, splenomegaly and infiltrations of the bone marrow, liver and spleen. Over the last few years, several new immunological drugs, particularly immunotoxins, BRAF inhibitors and B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors have been developed and investigated as potential treatment options. AREAS COVERED: This article summarizes recent investigational therapies of HCL, looking at their: mechanism of action, pharmacological properties, clinical activity and toxicity, as well as their emerging role in its treatment. The authors conducted a literature review of the MEDLINE database for articles in English concerning immunotoxins, BRAF inhibitors and BCR pathway inhibitors via PubMed. Publications from 2000 through to June 2015 were scrutinized. The search terms used were: BRAF, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, ibrutinib, monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins, moxetumomab pasudotox, and rituximab in conjunction with HCL. The authors also searched manually the conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and ACR/ARHP Annual Scientific Meetings were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles.

In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of LIFr in melanoma and assessed its prognostic value. Using tissue microarrays consisting of 441 melanomas and 96 nevi, we found that no normal nevi showed high LIFr expression. LIFr staining was significantly increased in primary melanoma compared to dysplastic nevi (P = 0.0003) and further increased in metastatic melanoma (P = 0.0000). Kaplan-Meier survival curve and univariate Cox regression analyses showed that increased expression of LIFr was correlated with poorer 5-year patient survival (overall survival, P = 0.0000; disease-specific survival, P = 0.0000). Multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that increased LIFr expression was an independent prognostic marker for primary melanoma (P = 0.036). LIFr knockdown inhibited melanoma cell migration in wound healing assays and reduced stress fiber formation. LIFr knockdown correlated with STAT3 suppression, but not YAP, suggesting that LIFr activation might stimulate melanoma cell migration through the STAT3 pathway. Our data indicate that strong LIFr expression identifies potentially highly malignant melanocytic lesions at an early stage and LIFr may be a potential target for the development of early intervention therapeutics.","['CCI-117958/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP-110974/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP-93810/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']","['0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, 411 cases (67.6 %) were male, the median age was 67, and 353 cases were severe (58.1 %). Aspergillus spp. was the most predominant causative agent among those infected with one pathogen. These data corroborate our previous data from reports in 2007 and 2009. For the first time since 1989, we observed a case of mycoses caused by Exophiala spp. with adult T cell leukemia and lymphoma. The types of underlying disease were also typical of that in our previous analysis in 2009. These included solid cancers in 124 cases (20.4 %), leukemia in 83 cases (13.7 %), bacterial infections such as pneumonia 69 cases (11.3 %) and malignant lymphoma in 66 cases (10.9 %). In 2011, the number of mycoses following solid organ transplantation totaled 12 cases and was the most numerous since 2005. A limitation of this study may be that the epidemiology of autopsied cases includes the more severe end of the fungal infection spectrum, and selection bias could not be ruled out. Nonetheless, this epidemiological analysis of autopsied cases with fungal infection provides a strong incentive to intensify and improve efforts in diagnosing and treating visceral mycosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A clinical trial was developed to evaluate the effect of the addition of PTX to the induction steroid window phase in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Thirty-two children were enrolled on this study. Children with a new diagnosis of ALL were randomly assigned to receive prednisone (PRD) 40 mg/m(2)/day only during the 7-day treatment pre-phase (PRD group, 11 patients) or to receive PRD with PTX (10 mg/kg/day) (PTX group, 11 patients); the control group included children with normal bone marrow (10 patients). Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) was performed at diagnosis (day -7) in all groups, and at day 0 (end of PRD window) for patients with ALL (PRD and PTX groups). Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry (FC) using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) stains. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Apoptotic index at day -7 was similar in all groups. However, at day 0 post-treatment, apoptosis was significantly higher in the PTX group than in the PRD group (p < 0.001). There were no serious adverse effects associated with PTX.

Epub 2015 Aug 29.,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review studies and meta-analyze the literature on the association of maternal and/or index child's coffee, tea, and cola consumption with subsequent development of childhood leukemia and its major subtypes. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified through a detailed algorithm and hand-search of eligible articles' references; thereafter, summary-effect estimates were calculated by leukemia subtype and dose-response meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Twelve case-control studies, comprising a total of 3649 cases and 5705 controls, were included. High maternal coffee consumption was positively associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; OR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.22-1.68) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.59-3.57). Any or low to moderate maternal cola consumption was also positively associated with overall leukemia (AL) and ALL, A linear trend between coffee and cola consumption and childhood leukemia was observed in the dose-response analyses. On the contrary, low to moderate tea consumption was inversely associated with AL (OR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.75-0.97), although the trend was non-significant. A null association between offspring's cola consumption and leukemia was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the detrimental association between maternal coffee consumption and childhood leukemia risk and provide indications for a similar role of maternal cola intake. In contrast, an inverse association with tea was found, implying that other micronutrients contained in this beverage could potentially counterbalance the deleterious effects of caffeine. Further research should focus on the intake of specific micronutrients, different types of coffee and tea, specific immunophenotypes of the disease, and the modifying effect of genetic polymorphisms.",,"['0 (Coffee)', '0 (Tea)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015.

Reconstruction magnetic resonance neurography showed a marked enlargement of the right brachial plexus. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed a radioactive lesion in the sacrum, in addition to the right brachial plexus, and a biopsy of the sacrum revealed myeloid sarcoma. The brachial plexus lesion was also regarded as myeloid sarcoma because of the treatment response. Isolated myeloid sarcoma involving the brachial plexus is very rare and its diagnosis is difficult as there was neither a history of leukemia nor bone marrow involvement in this patient. In this case, reconstructed magnetic resonance neurography was useful for detecting the brachial plexus mass lesion which led to an early diagnosis and good recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 2.,"Regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes involves many complex processes, in which chromatin structure plays an important role. In addition to the epigenetic effects, such as DNA methylation and phosphorylation or histone modifications, gene expression is also controlled by the spatial organization of chromatin. For example, distant regulatory elements (enhancers, insulators) may come into direct physical interaction with target genes or other regulatory elements located in genomic regions of up to several hundred kilobases in size. Such long-range interactions result in the formation of chromatin loops. In the last several years, there has been a rapid increase in our knowledge of the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus through the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology. Here we review and compare the original 3C and 3C-based methods including chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C), chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C), hi-resolution chromosome confomation capture (HiC). In this article, we discuss different aspects of how the nuclear organization of chromatin is associated with gene expression regulation and how this knowledge is useful in translational medicine and clinical applications. We demonstrate that the knowledge of the chromatin 3D organization may help understand the mechanisms of gene expression regulation of genes involved in the development of human diseases, such as CFTR (responsible for cystic fibrosis) or IGFBP3 (associated with breast cancer pathogenesis). Additionally, 3C-derivative methods have been also useful in the diagnosis of some leukemia subtypes.",,"['0 (CFTR protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (IGFBP3 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '126880-72-6 (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) labeled with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein were cultured in three-dimensional (3-D) self-assembling scaffolds and compared with traditional two-dimentional (2-D) culture techniques requiring mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers or leukemia inhibitory factor. 3-D scaffolds encapsulating ESCs were prepared by mixing ESCs with polyethylene glycol tetra-acrylate (PEG-4-Acr) and thiol-functionalized dextran (Dex-SH). Distribution of ESCs in 3-D was monitored by confocal microscopy. Viability and proliferation of encapsulated cells during long-term culture were determined by propidium iodide as well as direct cell counts and PrestoBlue (PB) assays. Genetic expression of pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, and Sox2) in ESCs grown under 2-D and 3-D culture conditions was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression of selected stemness markers was determined by two different methods, immunofluorescence staining (Oct4 and Nanog) and western blot analysis (Oct4, Nanog, and Klf4). Pluripotency of 3-D scaffold grown ESCs was analyzed by in vivo teratoma assay and in vitro differentiation via embryoid bodies into cells of all three germ layers. RESULTS: Self-assembling scaffolds encapsulating ESCs for 3-D culture without the loss of cell viability were prepared by mixing PEG-4-Acr and Dex-SH (1:1 v/v) to a final concentration of 5% (w/v). Scaffold integrity was dependent on the degree of thiol substitution of Dex-SH and cell concentration. Scaffolds prepared using Dex-SH with 7.5% and 33% thiol substitution and incubated in culture medium maintained their integrity for 11 and 13 d without cells and 22 +/- 5 d and 37 +/- 5 d with cells, respectively. ESCs formed compact colonies, which progressively increased in size over time due to cell proliferation as determined by confocal microscopy and PB staining. 3-D scaffold cultured ESCs expressed significantly higher levels (P < 0.01) of Oct4, Nanog, and Kl4, showing a 2.8, 3.0 and 1.8 fold increase, respectively, in comparison to 2-D grown cells. A similar increase in the protein expression levels of Oct4, Nanog, and Klf4 was observed in 3-D grown ESCs. However, when 3-D cultured ESCs were subsequently passaged in 2-D culture conditions, the level of these pluripotent markers was reduced to normal levels. 3-D grown ESCs produced teratomas and yielded cells of all three germ layers, expressing brachyury (mesoderm), NCAM (ectoderm), and GATA4 (endoderm) markers. Furthermore, these cells differentiated into osteogenic, chondrogenic, myogenic, and neural lineages expressing Col1, Col2, Myog, and Nestin, respectively. CONCLUSION: This novel 3-D culture system demonstrated long-term maintenance of mouse ESCs without the routine passaging and manipulation necessary for traditional 2-D cell propagation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well known that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) hide in hematopoietic niches and escape to the immune system surveillance through the outgrowth of poorly immunogenic tumor-cell variants and the suppression of the active immune response. Despite the introduction of new reagents and new therapeutic approaches, no treatment strategies have been able to definitively eradicate LSCs. However, recent adoptive immunotherapy in cancer is expected to revolutionize our way to fight against this disease, by redirecting the immune system in order to eliminate relapse issues. Initially described at the onset of the 90's, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are recombinant receptors transferred in various T cell subsets, providing specific antigens binding in a non-major histocompatibility complex restricted manner, and effective on a large variety of human leukocyte antigen-divers cell populations. Once transferred, engineered T cells act like an expanding ""living drug"" specifically targeting the tumor-associated antigen, and ensure long-term anti-tumor memory. Over the last decades, substantial improvements have been made in CARs design. CAR T cells have finally reached the clinical practice and first clinical trials have shown promising results. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, high rate of complete and prolonged clinical responses have been observed after anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy, with specific but manageable adverse events. In this review, our goal was to describe CAR structures and functions, and to summarize recent data regarding pre-clinical studies and clinical trials in acute leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This also includes non-Hodgkin lymphoma since it is well known that these enzymes are frequently involved in the lymphomagenesis. Hereby, tyrosine kinases might either be dysregulated intrinsically or be activated within signal transduction pathways leading to tumor survival and growth. Among others, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is of particular interest as a potential therapeutic target. Btk is stimulated by B-cell receptor signaling and activates different transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappaB. The Btk inhibitor ibrutinib has been approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle-cell lymphoma recently. Numerous clinical trials evaluating this agent in different combinations (eg, with rituximab or classical chemotherapeutic agents) as a treatment option for aggressive and indolent lymphoma are under way. Here, we summarize the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of indolent and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas (eg, mantle-cell lymphoma).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from 'Inhibition of bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) recruitment to chromatin as an effective treatment for mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-fusion leukemia' by Dawson and colleagues, published in Nature in 2011 (Dawson et al., 2011). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 2A, 3D, 4B, 4D and Supplementary Figures 11A-B and 16A. In this study, BET proteins were demonstrated as potential therapeutic targets for modulating aberrant gene expression programs associated with MLL-fusion leukemia. In Figure 2A, the BET bromodomain inhibitor I-BET151 was reported to suppress growth of cells harboring MLL-fusions compared to those with alternate oncogenic drivers. In Figure 3D, treatment of MLL-fusion leukemia cells with I-BET151 resulted in transcriptional suppression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2. Figures 4B and 4D tested the therapeutic efficacy of I-BET151 in vivo using mice injected with human MLL-fusion leukemia cells and evaluated disease progression following I-BET151 treatment. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.",,['0 (Chromatin)'],,,,,,,,,,"['Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology', 'Reproducibility Project Cancer Biology']","['Iorns E', 'Gunn W', 'Tan F', 'Lomax J', 'Perfito N', 'Errington T']","['Iorns, Elizabeth', 'Gunn, William', 'Tan, Fraser', 'Lomax, Joelle', 'Perfito, Nicole', 'Errington, Timothy']",,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 29.,"Survival for children with relapsed T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is poor when treated with chemotherapy alone, and outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is not well described. Two hundred twenty-nine children with T-ALL in second complete remission (CR2) received an HCT after myeloablative conditioning between 2000 and 2011 and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Median age was 10 years (range, 2 to 18). Donor source was umbilical cord blood (26%), matched sibling bone marrow (38%), or unrelated bone marrow/peripheral blood (36%). Acute (grades II to IV) and chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in, respectively, 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27% to 45%) and 26% (95% CI, 20% to 33%) of patients. Transplant-related mortality at day 100 and 3-year relapse rates were 13% (95% CI, 9% to 18%) and 30% (95% CI, 24% to 37%), respectively. Three-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 48% (95% CI, 41% to 55%) and 46% (95% CI, 39% to 52%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, patients with bone marrow relapse, with or without concurrent extramedullary relapse before HCT, were most likely to relapse (hazard ratio, 3.94; P = .005) as compared with isolated extramedullary disease. In conclusion, HCT for pediatric T-ALL in CR2 demonstrates reasonable and durable outcomes, and consideration for HCT is warranted.","['U10 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N00014-13-1-0039/PHS HHS/United States', 'N00014-14-1-0028/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Aug 29.,"The inclusion of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in cord blood transplantation is controversial. We evaluated outcomes according to ATG inclusion in 297 children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received myeloablative total body irradiation-based conditioning and either single-unit (74%) or double-unit (26%) grafts. Ninety-two patients (31%) received ATG and 205 (69%) did not. ATG recipients were more likely to be cytomegalovirus seronegative. The incidences of day 100 grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; 30% versus 54%, P = .0002) and chronic GVHD (22% versus 43%, P = .0008) were lower with ATG compared with non-ATG regimens. However, day 100 grades III to IV acute GVHD was comparable (11% versus 17%, P = .15). The 3-year incidences of transplant-related mortality (16% versus 17%, P = .98), relapse (17% versus 27%, P = .12), and leukemia-free survival (66% versus 55%, P = .23) in ATG and non-ATG recipients were similar. There were no differences in viral reactivation between treatment groups (60% versus 58%, P = .83). Therefore, the data suggest that incorporation of ATG with myeloablative conditioning regimens may be useful in reducing the risk of acute and chronic GVHD without any deleterious effect on transplant-related mortality, relapse, or leukemia-free survival in children and adolescents with ALL.","['P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N00014-13-1-0039/PHS HHS/United States', 'N00014-14-1-0028/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In 58% of samples, we found deletions in various glucocorticoid signaling pathway-associated genes, but only NR3C1 and ETV6 deletions prevailed in minimal residual disease poor responding and subsequently relapsing cases (p<0.05). To prove the necessity of a functional glucocorticoid receptor, we reconstituted wild-type NR3C1 expression in mutant, glucocorticoid-resistant REH cells and studied the glucocorticoid response in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. While these results prove that glucocorticoid receptor defects are crucial for glucocorticoid resistance in an experimental setting, they do not address the essential clinical situation where glucocorticoid resistance at relapse is rather part of a global drug resistance.",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed food craving using a modified Food Craving Inventory in 22 survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma (median age = 11.7 years) and evaluated its association with treatment exposure and changes in weight status over a one-year period. Mean total craving score was 2.1 (SD = 0.7). Survivors reported significantly higher mean craving score for fast-foods [2.6 (SD = 0.9)] than for sweets [2.1 (SD = 0.8)], carbohydrates [2.0 (SD = 0.6)], and fats [1.8 (SD = 0.7)] (all P values < 0.05). Results from multivariate linear regression indicated that survivors diagnosed at an older age (>/=4.5 years) experienced higher frequencies of food craving than those diagnosed at a younger age (<4.5 years) (beta = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.42, 1.34). Food craving, however, was not significantly associated with survivors' weight status over 12 months of follow-up. Food craving alone does not appear to explain the obesity risk in this sample of childhood cancer survivors. The role of food craving in shaping eating behavior and obesity risk needs to be further evaluated in a large cohort of childhood cancer survivors.","['P30DK46200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AG013925/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025752/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK046200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000073/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Achieving cell synchronization can be difficult for many cell systems. Standard practice is to block cell cycle progression at a specific stage and then release the accumulated cells producing a wave of cells progressing through the cycle in unison. However, some cell types find this block toxic resulting in abnormal cell cycling, or even mass death. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake can be used to track the cell cycle stage of individual cells. Cells incorporate this synthetic thymidine analog, while synthesizing new DNA during S phase. By providing BrdU for a brief period it is possible to mark a pool of cells that were in S phase while the BrdU was present. These cells can then be tracked through the remainder of the cell cycle and into the next round of replication, permitting the duration of the cell cycle phases to be determined without the need to induce a potentially toxic cell cycle block. It is also possible to determine and correlate the expression of both internal and external proteins during subsequent stages of the cell cycle. These can be used to further refine the assignment of cell cycle stage or assess effects on other cellular functions such as checkpoint activation or cell death.",,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that asphyxia induces bleeding by hyperfibrinolytic disseminated intravascular coagulation. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: A 2,100-bed tertiary care facility in Vienna, Austria, Europe. PATIENTS: All cases of drowning-induced asphyxia (n=49) were compared with other patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n=116) and to patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (n=83). Six drowning victims were investigated prospectively. To study the mechanism, a forearm-ischemia model was used in 20 volunteers to investigate whether hypoxia releases tissue plasminogen activator. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighty percent of patients with drowning-induced asphyxia developed overt disseminated intravascular coagulation within 24 hours. When compared with nondrowning cardiac arrest patients, drowning patients had a 13 times higher prevalence of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation at admission (55% vs 4%; p<0.001). Despite comparable disseminated intravascular coagulation scores, acute promyelocytic leukemia patients had higher fibrinogen but lower d-dimer levels and platelet counts than drowning patients (p<0.001). Drowning victims had a three-fold longer activated partial thromboplastin time (124 s; p<0.001) than both nondrowning cardiac arrest and acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Hyperfibrinolysis was reflected by up to 1,000-fold increased d-dimer levels, greater than 5-fold elevated plasmin antiplasmin levels, and a complete absence of thrombelastometric clotting patterns, which was reversed by antifibrinolytics and heparinase. Thirty minutes of forearm-ischemia increased tissue plasminogen activator 31-fold (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of drowning patients develops overt hyperfibrinolytic disseminated intravascular coagulation, partly caused by hypoxia induced tissue plasminogen activator release. Antifibrinolytics and heparinase partially reverse the abnormal clotting patterns. Severe activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation may be a marker of combined hyperfibrinolytic afibrinogenemia and autoheparinization in drowning-related asphyxia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PR-domain containing transcriptional regulator 14 (PRDM14), is essential for maintenance of ESC self-renewal when the cells are cultured in serum plus LIF, but not in 2i medium plus LIF. Here, we show that pluripotency of ESCs is maintained by enforced expression of PRDM14 at a high level, as observed in ESCs in 2i plus LIF and developing primordial germ cells in the absence of LIF. Constitutive expression of PRDM14 represses de novo DNA methylation in pluripotency-associated genes, resulting in the maintenance of gene expression after withdrawal of LIF, while also repressing the upregulation of differentiation markers. Further, knockdown of Tet1/Tet2 and administration of base excision repair (BER) pathway inhibitors impairs the PRDM14-induced resistance of ESCs to differentiation. We conclude that, in the absence of LIF, PRDM14 governs the retention of pluripotency-associated genes through the regulation of TET functions in the BER-mediated active demethylation pathway, while acting to exert TET-independent transcriptional repressive activity of several differentiation markers.",,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Prdm14 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TET1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Aug 30.,"Allelic variants of genes implicated in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) determine the pharmacokinetic variability of many medications and are increasingly recognized as important factors determining the success or failure of medical treatments. Both tacrolimus and sirolimus have narrow therapeutic ranges maintained by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Using an ADME panel that covers >99% of the PharmaADME working group core list (188 single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] and 12 copy number variant [CNV] assays in 36 pharmacogenetically relevant genes), we studied 177 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using tacrolimus/sirolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We tested for possible associations between ADME variants and tacrolimus/sirolimus drug levels, concentration/dose (C/D) ratio, and clinical endpoints, including acute GVHD. A total of 62 SNP and 6 CNV assays were evaluable after removing the variants, which were homozygous in (nearly) all samples. For sirolimus, rs2032582 (ABCB1) T-carriers versus non-T-carriers were associated with higher blood levels (P = .01), with similar results for C/D ratio. Generalized estimating equation analysis supported these findings. For tacrolimus, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were associated with higher blood levels than CYP3A5*1/*1 (P = .002). By multivariable analysis, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were independently associated with decreased acute GVHD compared with CYP3A5*1/*1, after adjustment for conditioning, donor type, race/ethnicity, and age. We demonstrated association of specific ADME genetic polymorphisms with blood levels of tacrolimus/sirolimus, and incidence of acute GVHD after HCT, in spite of TDM and dose adjustment. A larger ongoing study will determine whether these associations have clinical utility beyond TDM.","['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Aug 29.,"New drugs targeting important cellular signaling pathways are currently being developed for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is therefore of interest to analyze their in vitro killing capacity in manufacturer-independent, comparative experiments. We here report on the sensitivity of CLL cells to a panel of emerging targeted therapeutics using high-throughput screening based on an automated fluorescence digital scanning system. Fresh CLL cells from 42 patients with indolent or progressive CLL were cultured for 72 hours on microtiter plates in a unique primary cell culture medium. Antitumor effects of 31 small therapeutic molecules (and, as controls, 29 cytostatic agents) at equimolar concentration were compared in a fluorescence survival assay. In vitro sensitivity to each drug exhibited considerable interpatient variability. The highest mean direct killing was observed for one survivin inhibitor (YM-155), two bcl-2 inhibitors (ABT-199, ABT-737), and one selective CDK inhibitor (dinaciclib). Their killing capacity was, in contrast to most cytostatic agents, similarly high in refractory versus untreated CLL patients and was significantly higher on cells with the 17p deletion/TP53 mutation than on cells with other cytogenetic abnormalities (p = 0.02). Sensitivity of bone marrow and lymph node cells was highly correlated with that of blood cells. Even though direct killing may not be the only therapeutic effector function in vivo, results from this head-to-head comparison may help to identify drugs of particular interest for intensified clinical development.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Sep 1.,"BACKGROUND: UK policy aims to improve cancer outcomes by promoting early diagnosis, which for many haematological malignancies is particularly challenging as the pathways leading to diagnosis can be difficult and prolonged. METHODS: A survey about symptoms was sent to patients in England with acute leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Symptoms and barriers to first help seeking were examined for each subtype, along with the relative risk of waiting >3 months' time from symptom onset to first presentation to a doctor, controlling for age, sex and deprivation. RESULTS: Of the 785 respondents, 654 (83.3%) reported symptoms; most commonly for NHL (95%) and least commonly for CLL (67.9%). Some symptoms were frequent across diseases while others were more disease-specific. Overall, 16% of patients (n=114) waited >3 months before presentation; most often in CML (24%) and least in acute leukaemia (9%). Significant risk factors for >3 months to presentation were: night sweats (particularly CLL and NHL), thirst, abdominal pain/discomfort, looking pale (particularly acute leukaemias), and extreme fatigue/tiredness (particularly CML and NHL); and not realising symptom(s) were serious.

This immunotherapeutic strategy is predicated on gene transfer technology to instruct T lymphocytes to recognize and reject tumor cells. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that mediate antigen recognition, T cell activation, and - in the case of second-generation CARs - costimulation to augment T cell functionality and persistence. We demonstrated over a decade ago that human T cells engineered with a CD19-specific CAR eradicated B cell malignancies in mice. Several phase I clinical trials eventually yielded dramatic results in patients with leukemia or lymphoma, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

MAIN METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to determine cell cycle changes in HL-60 cells following treatment (1.0 muM) with natural and synthetic retinoids (ATRA, RII and R9158), and cDNA microarrays were used to monitor the gene expression profiles of HL-60 cells treated with the various retinoids. KEY FINDINGS: Consistent with retinoid-induced cell differentiation, treatment with these three retinoids correlated with an increase in the percentage of cells arrested in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle. Microarray analysis showed upregulation of known differentiation genes, adhesion molecules, and the oxidase activation pathway following retinoid treatment. Differential expression of several genes was observed in HL-60 cells treated with the three retinoids. For example, tissue remodeling protein genes, ubiquitin genes, and signal transduction genes were highly expressed in ATRA- and R9158-treated HL-60 cells, but remained unchanged in HL-60 cells treated with RII. SIGNIFICANCE: The above findings suggest that the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by the three retinoids occurs through similar pathways, and that there exists a structure-function relationship regarding retinoids and the induction of cell differentiation and cytotoxicity.",,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Retinoids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"The central role of the microRNA (miR) 15a/16-1 cluster in B-cell oncogenesis has been extensively demonstrated, with over two-thirds of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia characterized by the deletion of the miR-15a/16-1 locus at 13q14. Despite the well-established understanding of the molecular mechanisms occurring during miR-15a/16-1 dysregulation, the oncogenic role of other miR-15/16 family members, such as the miR-15b/16-2 cluster (3q25), is still far from being elucidated. Whereas miR-15a is highly similar to miR-15b, miR-16-1 is identical to miR-16-2; thus, it could be speculated that both clusters control a similar set of target genes and may have overlapping functions. However, the biological role of miR-15b/16-2 is still controversial. We generated miR-15b/16-2 knockout mice to better understand the cluster's role in vivo. These mice developed B-cell malignancy by age 15-18 mo with a penetrance of 60%. At this stage, mice showed significantly enlarged spleens with abnormal B cell-derived white pulp enlargement. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an expanded CD19+ CD5+ population in the spleen of 40% knockout mice, a characteristic of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia-associated phenotype found in humans. Of note, miR-15b/16-2 modulates the CCND2 (Cyclin D2), CCND1 (Cyclin D1), and IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) genes involved in proliferation and antiapoptotic pathways in mouse B cells. These results are the first, to our knowledge, to suggest an important role of miR-15b/16-2 loss in the pathogenesis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['U01 CA166905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA151319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA151319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Ccnd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccnd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn15 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mirn16 microRNA, mouse)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"PURPOSE: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) still is lacking a cure. Relapse and development of refractoriness to current treatments are common. New therapies are needed to improve patient prognosis and survival. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a natural product with antitumor properties already clinically tested. The effect of I3C, F-ara-A, and combinations of both drugs on CLL cells from patients representing different Rai stages, IGHV mutation status, cytogenetic alterations, p53 functionality, and treatment resistances was tested, as well as the toxicity of these treatments in mice. RESULTS: I3C induces cytotoxicity in CLL cells but not in normal lymphocytes. I3C strongly synergized with F-ara-A in all CLL cells tested, including those with p53 deficiency and/or F-ara-A resistance. The mechanism of cell death involved p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis. The combination of I3C + F-ara-A was equally effective in CLL cells irrespective of IGHV mutation stage and patient refractoriness. Moreover, CLL survival and treatment resistance induced by co-culturing CLL cells on stroma cells were overcome by the combinatory I3C + F-ara-A treatment. No toxicity was associated with the combined I3C + fludarabine treatment in mice. CONCLUSIONS: I3C in combination with F-ara-A is highly cytotoxic in CLL cells from refractory patients and those with p53 deficiency. The striking dose reduction index for F-ara-A in combination with I3C would reduce fludarabine toxicity while having a similar or better anti-CLL effectiveness. Moreover, the low toxicity of I3C, already clinically tested, supports its use as adjuvant and combinatory therapy in CLL, particularly for patients with relapsed or refractory disease.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', 'C11E72455F (indole-3-carbinol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2017 Jun 15;23 (12 ):3226.

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"The MLL3 (mixed lineage leukemia 3) protein is a member of the human SET1 family of histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferases and contains the conserved WDR5 interaction (Win) motif and the catalytic suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, trithorax (SET) domain. The human SET1 family includes MLL1-4 and SETd1A/B, which all interact with a conserved subcomplex containing WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30 (WRAD) to form the minimal core complex required for full methyltransferase activity. However, recent evidence suggests that the WDR5 subunit may not be utilized in an identical manner within all SET1 family core complexes. Although the roles of WDR5 within the MLL1 core complex have been extensively studied, not much is known about the roles of WDR5 in other SET1 family core complexes. In this investigation, we set out to characterize the roles of the WDR5 subunit in the MLL3 core complex. We found that unlike MLL1, the MLL3 SET domain assembles with the RbBP5/Ash2L heterodimer independently of the Win motif-WDR5 interaction. Furthermore, we observed that WDR5 inhibits the monomethylation activity of the MLL3 core complex, which is dependent on the Win motif. We also found evidence suggesting that the WRAD subcomplex catalyzes weak H3K4 monomethylation within the context of the MLL3 core complex.

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1, the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia, expresses the viral oncoprotein Tax1. In contrast, HTLV-2, which expresses Tax2, is non-leukemogenic. One difference between these homologous proteins is the presence of a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) in Tax1, previously reported to be important for non-canonical NFkappaB activation. In contrast, this study finds no defect in non-canonical NFkappaB activity by deletion of the Tax1 PBM. Instead, Tax1 PBM was found to be important for Akt activation. Tax1 attenuates the effects of negative regulators of the PI3K-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), and PHLPP. Tax1 competes with PTEN for binding to DLG-1, unlike a PBM deletion mutant of Tax1. Forced membrane expression of PTEN or PHLPP overcame the effects of Tax1, as measured by levels of Akt phosphorylation, and rates of Akt dephosphorylation. The current findings suggest that Akt activation may explain the differences in transforming activity of HTLV-1 and -2.","['P50 CA094056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,"['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"The outcome for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who relapse is dismal. A hallmark of relapsed disease is acquired resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, particularly glucocorticoids. In this study, we performed a genome-scale short hairpin RNA screen to identify mediators of prednisolone sensitivity in ALL cell lines. The incorporation of these data with an integrated analysis of relapse-specific genetic and epigenetic changes allowed us to identify the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as a mediator of prednisolone resistance in pediatric ALL. We show that knockdown of the specific MAPK pathway members MEK2 and MEK4 increased sensitivity to prednisolone through distinct mechanisms. MEK4 knockdown increased sensitivity specifically to prednisolone by increasing the levels of the glucocorticoid receptor. MEK2 knockdown increased sensitivity to all chemotherapy agents tested by increasing the levels of p53. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of MEK1/2 with trametinib increased sensitivity of ALL cells and primary samples to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. To confirm a role for MAPK signaling in patients with relapsed ALL, we measured the activation of the MEK1/2 target ERK in matched diagnosis-relapse primary samples and observed increased phosphorylated ERK levels at relapse. Furthermore, relapse samples have an enhanced response to MEK inhibition compared to matched diagnosis samples in xenograft models. Together, our data indicate that inhibition of the MAPK pathway increases chemosensitivity to glucocorticoids and possibly other agents and that the MAPK pathway is an attractive target for prevention and/or treatment of relapsed disease.","['R01 CA172385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '101880/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '2P30CA016087-33/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA082086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM066704/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA172385-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '33E86K87QN (trametinib)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K4 protein, human)']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a PRO endpoint conducted in patients with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was performed. Eligible studies were evaluated independently, according to a pre-defined coding scheme, by two reviewers. Thirteen RCTs, enrolling overall 3380 patients were identified. There were four RCTs involving acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML), one with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), five with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and three with MDS. Six RCTs accurately documented PRO methodology assessment and were thus considered likely to robustly inform clinical decision-making. Of these, three RCTs dealt with AML, two with CLL, one with MDS. A growing number of RCTs in leukemia and MDS have included a PRO component in recent years. Inclusion of PROs in RCTs is feasible and can provide unique information to facilitate clinical decision-making.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"PURPOSE: Survivors of childhood cancer carry a substantial burden of long-term morbidity; personal risk awareness is critical to ensure survivors' engagement in early detection/management of complications. The impact of education provided in survivorship clinics on survivors' understanding of their personal health risks is unclear. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with cancer at age 21 years or younger and at 2 or more years off therapy completed questionnaires about awareness of personal risk for therapy-related complications at T0 (first survivorship clinic visit) and at T1 to T5 (subsequent visits). After questionnaire completion at each clinic visit, survivors received education tailored to personal risk. RESULTS: A total of 369 survivors completed 1,248 visits (median, three visits; range, one to six visits). The median age at cancer diagnosis was 11 years (range, 0 to 21 years); the median age at T0 was 24 years (range, 5 to 57 years); 38% were white; 45% had leukemia; and 34% received hematopoietic cell transplantation. The cohort was at risk for a median of six (range, one to nine) complications. Awareness increased from 38.6% at T0 to 66.3% at T3. Generalized estimating equations (that adjusted for diagnosis, hematopoietic cell transplantation, race/ethnicity, and patient/parent education) showed significant gains in awareness from T0 to T1 (P < .001), T1 to T2 (P = .03), and T2 to T3 (P < .001) but no significant gain thereafter through T5 (P = .7). Predictors of low awareness included education less than a college degree (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; P = .02), longer time from diagnosis (OR, 1.03/year; P = .04), diagnosis of leukemia (OR, 2.1; P = .004), nonwhite race (OR, 2.8; P < .001), and risk for six or fewer complications (OR, 2.1; P = .002). CONCLUSION: Risk-based education in a survivorship clinic significantly increases awareness of personal health risk through three sessions, with saturation thereafter. Vulnerable populations with minimal gain in awareness identified in this study could inform targeted interventions.",,,['J Clin Oncol. 2015 Nov 20;33(33):3849-50.

A decade after the seminal discovery of an activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in nearly all patients with PV, new treatment options are finally beginning to emerge, necessitating a critical reappraisal of the underlying pathogenesis and therapeutic modalities available for PV. Herein, we comprehensively review clinical aspects of PV including diagnostic considerations, natural history, and risk factors for thrombosis. We summarize recent studies delineating the genetic basis of PV, including their implications for evolution to myelofibrosis and secondary acute myeloid leukemia. We assess the quality of evidence to support the use of currently available therapies, including aspirin, phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, and interferon. We analyze recent studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of JAK inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, and evaluate their role in the context of other available therapies for PV. This review provides a framework for practicing hematologists and oncologists to make rational treatment decisions for patients with PV.",['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'I8309403R0 (peginterferon beta-1a)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"In invasive candidiasis, there has been an epidemiological shift from Candida albicans to non-albicans species infections, including infections with C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. Although the prevalence of C. krusei remains low among yeast infections, its intrinsic resistance to fluconazole raises epidemiological and therapeutic concerns. Echinocandins have in vitro activity against most Candida spp. and are the first-line agents in the treatment of candidemia. Although resistance to echinocandin drugs is still rare, individual cases of C. krusei resistance have been reported in recent years, especially with strains that have been under selective pressure. A total of 15 C. krusei strains, isolated from the blood, urine, and soft tissue of an acute lymphocytic leukemia patient, were analyzed. Strains developed echinocandin resistance during 10 days of caspofungin therapy. The molecular epidemiology of the isolates was investigated using two different typing methods: PCR-based amplification of the species-specific repetitive polymorphic CKRS-1 sequence and multilocus sequence typing. All isolates were genetically related, and the mechanism involved in decreased echinocandin susceptibility was characterized. Clinical resistance was associated with an increase in echinocandin MICs in vitro and was related to three different mutations in hot spot 1 of the target enzyme Fks1p. Molecular evidence of the rapid acquisition of resistance by different mutations in FKS1 highlights the need to monitor the development of resistance in C. krusei infections treated with echinocandin drugs.",,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Epub 2015 Aug 25.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias and a high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Fucoidan, a complex sulphated polysaccharide isolated from the cell wall of brown seaweeds, has recently attracted attention for its multiple biological activities and its potential as a novel candidate for cancer therapy. In the present study, the anticancer activity of fucoidan was investigated in the MDS/AML cell line SKM1. Fucoidan inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and caused G1-phase arrest of the cell cycle in SKM1 cells as determined by a cell counting kit 8 assay and flow cytometry. Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses indicated that treatment with fucoidan (100 microg/ml for 48 h) activated Fas and caspase8 in SKM1 cells, which are critical for the extrinsic apoptotic pathway; furthermore, caspase9 was activated via decreases in phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling as indicated by reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt, suggesting the involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition, fucoidan treatment of SKM1 cells resulted in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as determined by staining with dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate. These results suggested that the mechanisms of the anticancer effects of fucoidan in SKM1 are closely associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death, which partly attributed to the activation of apoptotic pathways and accumulation of intracellular ROS. Our results demonstrated that Fucoidan inhibits proliferation and induces the apoptosis of SKM1 cells, which provides substantial therapeutic potential for MDS treatment.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are found in >70% of secondary glioblastomas and lower-grade gliomas (grades II-III). Among the numerous phenotypic differences between IDH1 mutant and wild-type glioma patients, the most salient is an improved survival rate for patients with a mutation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding, singlestranded RNAs that can negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, predominantly by binding to the 3'untranslated region of their target mRNAs. The dysregulated expression of several miRNAs has been reported to modulate glioma progression; however, it is unclear whether mutations in IDH1 regulate glioma cell proliferation through miRNA dysregulation. In the present study, stable overexpression of IDH1WT or IDH1R132H was established in the U87 glioma cell line. It was found that IDH1R132H decreased cell proliferation of U87 glioma cells by inducing the expression of the miRNA miR128a. This process was dependent on the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor1alpha (HIF1alpha), which binds to a hypoxia response element in the promoter of miR128a. Furthermore, miR128a negatively regulated the expression of Bcellspecific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 protein (Bmi1), which is involved in suppressing cell proliferation. These findings suggest that the IDH1R132HHIF1alphamiR128aBmi1 pathway is involved in glioma cell proliferation.",,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (MIRN128 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data demonstrate that FLT3 is an important sensor of cellular nutritional state and elucidate the role and molecular mechanism of CMA in metabolic regulation and mediating cancer cell death. Importantly, our proteome analysis revealed that HK2 is a CMA substrate and that its degradation by CMA is regulated by glucose availability. We reveal a new mechanism by which excessive activation of CMA may be exploited pharmacologically to eliminate cancer cells by inhibiting both FLT3 and autophagy. Our study delineates a novel pharmacological strategy to promote the degradation of HK2 in cancer cells.","['P41 GM103533/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH067880/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '8P41GM103533-17/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN268201000035C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01MH067880/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN268201000035C/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",['Autophagy. 2015;11(12):2370-1.

In the present study, we showed that IGFBP-3 significantly enhanced interleukin-24 (IL-24)-induced cell death in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines in vitro. Both the addition of IGFBP-3 to cell medium or the enforced expression of IGFBP-3 in the PC cell line inhibited activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Downregulation of mTOR/S6K reduced Mcl-1 protein expression and consequently promoted sensitization to IL-24 treatment. Overexpression of Mcl-1 reduced the level of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) induced by IL-24 and IGFBP-3, suggesting that the IL-24-induced apoptosis is realized by way of Mcl-1. We then showed that the combination of IL-24 and IGFBP-3 significantly suppressed PC tumor growth in vivo.

Geldanamycin (GA), the first identified Hsp90 inhibitor, exhibited potent antitumor activity, but possessed significant hepatotoxicity. To overcome the hepatotoxicity derived from the quinone structure of GA, a non-quinone GA derivative 17-demethoxy-reblastatin (17-DR) was obtained from a genetically modified strain of Streptomyces hygroscopicus. In the present study, we examined the anticancer effects of 17-DR on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines HepG2 and SMMC7721, and its underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that 17-DR could concentration-dependently inhibit the proliferation, and decrease the colony formation in HCC cells. It also induced significant apoptosis in HCC cells, which was mediated by mitochondria via a caspase-dependent pathway. The mechanisms involved in 17-DR-induced apoptosis included the downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), and upregulation of Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (Bak). And the upregulated Bak expression resulted from downregulation of Mcl-1 played an essential role in this process. Taken together, these results indicated that 17-DR possessed potent anticancer effects on HCC cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.",,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRESENTATION OF CASE: Our patient presented with a surgical wound infection, comorbidities were Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukemia (CLL), Body Mass Index (BMI) of 50, hypertension and diet controlled type-2 diabetes. In surgery, wide necrotic wound debridement, early and repetitive wound drainages with the use of a large pore polypropylene mesh and a detailed surgical follow up was required. High dose intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) was administrated in combination with adopting a multidisciplinary approach was key to our success. DISCUSSION: Stoppa Re et al. complied a series of 360 ventral hernia mesh repairs reporting an infection rate of 12% that were managed conservatively. However, our selective case is unique within current literature, being the first to illustrate mesh salvage in a morbid obese patient with CLL. Recent modifications in mesh morphology, such as lower density, wide pores, and lighter weight has led to considerable improvements regarding infection avoidance. CONCLUSION: This case has demonstrated how a planned multidisciplinary action can produce prosperous results in a severely obese immunocompromised patient with an SSI, following an incisional hernia repair.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

Therefore, allogeneic (allo) HSCT has been applied to those patients in first complete remission (CR1), and has shown a long-term survival rate of approximately 50 %. In terms of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen, higher dose of cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) (the standard CY + TBI) has been generally applied to allo HSCT. Other MAC regimens such as busulfan-based or etoposide-based regimens have also been used. Among those, medium-dose etoposide (ETP) in addition to the standard CY + TBI conditioning regimen appears to be promising for allo HSCT in adult ALL when transplanted in ALL patients aged under 50 years in CR1 and also in CR2, showing an excellent outcome without increasing relapse or transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates. By contrast, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have also been applied to adult ALL patients and favorable outcomes have been obtained; however, relapse and TRM rates remain high. Therefore, an allo HSCT conditioning regimen which deserves further study for adult ALL patients aged under 50 years in CR1 and CR2 appears to be medium-dose ETP + CY + TBI and RIC is suitable for patients aged over 50 years or for younger patients with comorbid conditions. On the contrary, new therapeutic strategies for adult ALL patients are increasingly utilized with better outcomes; namely, various tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL, human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical HSCT, and pediatric-inspired regimens for Ph-negative ALL. Therefore, the optimal treatment modality should be selected considering patient's age, Ph-positivity, donor availability, risk classification, efficacy, and safety.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This matter still remains to be a mystery. METHODS: In this study, the ability of ignoring negative stimuli as a technique of emotion regulation was investigated in children with cancer. For this purpose, 78 children (33 girls and 45 boys aged 3 to 12 years) with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 89 healthy children (52 girls and 37 boys aged3 to 12 years) participated in this study. At the first stage, a number of positive,negative and neutral pictures were displayed to children. At the second stage, they were asked to identify the pictures from among a collection. RESULTS: Data analysis by MANOVA indicated that children with cancer, compared with healthy children, could recognize more positive images than negative ones. Furthermore, it was found that age, sex, duration of hospital stay, duration of disease and financial situation had an effect on the difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Positive bias memory can explain low depression and lack of symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder in children with ALL. Attention shifting is multifactorial phenomenon and neurologic factors and family support play important role in this happening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Copper (Cu) has an important role in angiogenesis and acts by increasing Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Serum levels of copper will be increased in cancer incidence, progression and recurrence. The aim of this study was to measure blood levels of copper, zinc, and the ratio of Cu /Zn, as well as VEGF levels before and after treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Thirty patients who were recently diagnosed with Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) in Shahid Ghazi Tabatabai oncology hospital enrolled in this clinical trial. On the first day, blood samples were taken for copper, zinc, and VEGF assay and flowcytometry. Treatment protocol was (7x3) regimen. Blood samples were collected for evaluation of copper, zinc, and VEGF. They were sent to Biochemistry Laboratory in medicine faculty for analysis. RESULTS: Amongst 30 AML patients, 14 (46.7%) were female and 16 (53.3%) were male. Patients of various ages ranged from 16 to 53 years, with a median age of 9.1+/-9.35 years. The mean serum level of copper, zinc, and mean Cu/Zn ratio before and after treatment showed significant difference (p<0.05) There was also significant difference between the mean VEGF level before and after treatment (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that there is no significant relationship between copper, zinc serum levels, their ratio, and VEGF in AML patients. We hypothesize that increased serum copper is associated with increase of VEGF levels which can indicate the impact of copper in malignancies including AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although gender has not been included in prognostic systems, male gender has been found as a bad prognostic indicator in Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The relationship between gender and prognosis is not clear in patients with DLBCL treated with rituximab-containing regimens. The aim of this meta-analysis is to determine the prognostic/predictive role of gender in patients with DLBCL treated with rituximab-containing regimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We systematically searched for studies investigating the relationships between gender and prognosis in DLBCL treated with rituximab-containing regimens. After careful review, survival data were extracted from eligible studies. A meta-analysis was performed to generate combined hazard ratios for overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS) and event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: A total of 5635 patients from 20 studies were included in the analysis. Our results showed that male gender was associated with poor prognosis in terms of overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.155; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.037-1.286; p < 0.009). The pooled hazard ratio for DFS and EFS showed that male gender was not statistically significant (HR = 1.219; 95% CI: 0.782-1.899; p = 0.382, HR = 0.809; 95% CI: 0.577-1.133; p = 0.217).

Much of this complexity results from the presence of numerous histone post-translational modifications and histone variants. Alterations in the patterns of histone post-translational modifications are emerging as a feature of many types of cancer and have been shown to have prognostic value. RESULTS: We have applied a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based approach to comprehensively characterize the histone proteome in primary samples from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, as well as bladder and breast cancer cell culture models. When compared to non-malignant CD19+ B cells from healthy donors, the CLL histone proteome showed a distinct signature of differentially expressed species, spanning all the histones studied and including both post-translationally modified species and unmodified, non-allelic replication-dependent histone isoforms. However, the large changes in histone H3 and H4 that are characteristic of many cancer types were not observed. One of species of H2A (mass = 14,063 Da) was the most strongly associated with time to treatment in CLL patients. CLL patient samples also demonstrated histone profiles that were distinct from those of the bladder and breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Signatures of histone profiles are complex and can distinguish between healthy individuals and CLL patients and may provide prognostic markers. In addition, histone profiles may define tissue specific malignancies.","['P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM062970/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of five alkaloids including a furoquinoline montrofoline (1) and four acridones namely 1-hydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methylacridone (2), norevoxanthine (3), evoxanthine (4), 1,3-dimethoxy-10-methylacridone (5) against 9 drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines. The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these compounds, whilst caspase-Glo assay was used to detect caspase activation. Cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were all analyzed via flow cytometry. RESULTS: Furoquinoline 1 as well as the acridone alkaloids 2-5 displayed cytotoxic effects with IC50 values below 138 microM on all the 9 tested cancer cell lines. The IC50 values ranged from 41.56 microM (towards hepatocarinoma HepG2 cells) to 90.66 microM [towards colon carcinoma HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells] for 1, from 6.78 microM [towards HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells) to 106.47 microM [towards breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231-pcDNA cells] for 2, from 5.72 microM (towards gliobastoma U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells) to 137.62 microM (towards leukemia CCRF-CEM cells] for 3, from 6.11 microM [towards HCT116 (p53(+/+)) cells] to 80.99 microM (towards HepG2 cells] for 4, from 3.38 microM (towards MDA-MB-231-BCRP cells) to 58.10 microM (towards leukemia CEM/ADR5000 cells] for 5 and from 0.20 microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 195.12 microM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin.

Studies of genetic susceptibility to cancer using biallelic insertion/deletion (INDEL) type polymorphisms associated with cancer development pathways may help to clarify etymology of ALL. In this study, we investigate the role of eight functional INDEL polymorphisms and influence of genetic ancestry to B-cell ALL susceptibility in children of Brazilian Amazon population, which has a high degree of inter-ethnic admixture. Ancestry analysis was estimated using a panel of 48 autosomal ancestry informative markers. 130 B-cell ALL patients and 125 healthy controls were included in this study. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for confounders. The results indicated an association between the investigated INDEL polymorphisms in CASP8 (rs3834129), CYP19A1 (rs11575899) e XRCC1 (rs3213239) genes in the development of B-cell ALL. The carriers of Insertion/Insertion (Ins/Ins) genotype of the polymorphism in CASP8 gene presented reduced chances of developing B-cell ALL (P=0.001; OR=0.353; 95% CI=0.192-0.651). The Deletion/Deletion (Del/Del) genotype of the polymorphism in CYP19A1 gene was associated to a lower chance of developing B-cell ALL (P=3.35x10(-6); OR=0.121; 95% CI=0.050-0.295), while Del/Del genotype of the polymorphism in XRCC1 gene was associated to a higher chance of developing B-cell ALL (P=2.01x10(-4); OR=6.559; 95% CI=2.433-17.681). We also found that Amerindian ancestry correlates with the risk of B-cell ALL. For each increase of 10% in the Amerindian ancestry results in 1.4-fold chances of developing B-cell ALL (OR=1.406; 95% IC=1.123-1.761), while each increase of 10% in the European ancestry presents a protection effect in the development of B-cell ALL (OR=0.666; 95% IC=0.536-0.827). The results suggest that genetic factors influence leukemogenesis and might be explored in the stratification of B-cell ALL risk in admixed populations.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Z.

Epub 2015 Aug 27.,"AIMS: We aimed to describe and compare survival in teenagers and young adults (TYAs) with cancer to that of younger children and older adults, to identify sub-populations at greater or lesser risk of death. METHODS: We compared survival in cancer patients diagnosed in the United Kingdom aged 13-24 years (TYAs) to those aged 0-12 (children) and 25-49 years (adults) using the National Cancer Data Repository. All cases had a first cancer diagnosis between 1st January 2001 and 31st December 2005 with censor date 31st December 2010 or death if earlier. RESULTS: We found six distinct statistically significant survival patterns. In pattern 1, the younger the age-group the better the 1- and 5-year survival (acute lymphoid leukaemia, carcinoma of ovary and melanoma). In pattern 2, TYAs had a worse 5-year survival than both children and young adults (bone and soft tissues sarcomas). In pattern 3, TYAs had a worse 1-year survival but no difference at 5-years (carcinoma of cervix and female breast). In pattern 4, TYAs had better 1-year survival than adults, but no difference at 5 years (carcinoma of liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, germ cell tumours of extra-gonadal sites). In pattern 5, the younger the age-group the better the 5-year survival, but the difference developed after 1-year (acute myeloid leukaemia, carcinoma of colon and rectum). In pattern 6, there was no difference in 1- and 5-year survival between TYAs and adults (testicular germ cell tumours, ovarian germ cell tumours and carcinoma of thyroid). CONCLUSION: TYAs with specific cancer diagnoses can be grouped according to 1- and 5-year survival patterns compared to children and young adults. To further improve survival for TYAs, age-specific biology, pharmacology, proteomics, genomics, clinician and patient behaviour studies embedded within clinical trials are required.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper makes a contribution by providing findings on a group of regional, rural and remote cancer patients, namely those diagnosed with a haematological malignancy, who have to relocate for specialist care in Queensland, Australia. Methods A descriptive qualitative method was used based on 45 in-depth interviews with haematology patients living in Queensland who were supported by the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland. Results Four key factors were found to affect the decision making of patients who prefer to travel to metropolitan hospitals for specialist haematology treatments, namely access to own doctor, bonds and familiarity with metropolitan staff, desire for 'quality' specialist care and a distrust of local clinical care and, for some, the absence of usual barriers to visiting the metropolitan area. Conclusions There are a group of patients who have experiences that lead them to distrust non-metropolitan hospitals and motivate them to travel long distances to attend specialist treating centres for 'quality' care. The literature affirms the concerns of this group. It is the hope and expectation in publishing this article that these patients' concerns will be taken into consideration in the development of health services and policy so that eventually all regional, rural and remote patients will be provided with equitable choice with regard to the location of accessing specialist care. What is known about the topic? The literature on haematology patients' experiences with and preferences for local verses metropolitan hospital treatment is limited. What does this paper add? To date, research on relocation for specialist treatment has documented the hardships for both patients and their families associated with distance from major treating hospitals. Although affirming the difficulties associated with travel and the desire of most haematology patients to be treated locally, this article completes the picture with detailed findings on a subset of patients who would prefer to travel to a metropolitan centre for treatment. What are the implications for practitioners? The issues with regard to relocation for specialist treatment are complex and associated with a range of 'trade-offs', both positive and negative, for haematology patients. Thus, with regard to both service delivery and health policy decision making, the full range of factors needs to be taken into consideration. This paper indicates that, for a subgroup of haematology patients, their experience and beliefs about issues of quality of care are paramount.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 27.,"Alterations of IKZF1, encoding the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS, are a hallmark of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however the role of IKZF1 alterations in ALL pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that in mouse models of BCR-ABL1 leukemia, Ikzf1 and Arf alterations synergistically promote the development of an aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Ikzf1 alterations result in acquisition of stem cell-like features, including self-renewal and increased bone marrow stromal adhesion. Retinoid receptor agonists reversed this phenotype, partly by inducing expression of IKZF1, resulting in abrogation of adhesion and self-renewal, cell cycle arrest, and attenuation of proliferation without direct cytotoxicity. Retinoids potentiated the activity of dasatinib in mouse and human BCR-ABL1 ALL, providing an additional therapeutic option in IKZF1-mutated ALL.","['U24-CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA157937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA23944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 CA145707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Aug 28.,"BACKGROUND: The association between enterovirus infections in children and risk of leukaemia is unclear. We aimed to assess the risk of leukaemia after enterovirus infection in children. METHODS: We did a nationwide retrospective cohort study by analysing data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Children with enterovirus infections aged younger than 18 years were identified. With use of computer-generated random numbers, children not infected with enterovirus were randomly selected and frequency matched (1:1) with children infected with enterovirus by sex, age, urbanisation level, parental occupation, and index year of enterovirus infection. We only included children with complete baseline data for age and sex and who had at least three clinic visits with the diagnosis of enterovirus infection. The diagnosis date of the first clinic visit for the enterovirus infection was defined as the index date for initiation of follow-up person-year measurement and participants. All study patients were followed up until they developed leukaemia, were lost to follow-up, withdrew from the NHI programme, or until the end of the study without leukaemia (censored). Our primary endpoint was a diagnosis of leukaemia during follow-up. FINDINGS: Insurance claims data for 3 054 336 children younger than 18 years were randomly selected from all insured children in the NHIRD. We identified 282 360 children infected with enterovirus and 282 355 children not infected with enterovirus between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2007. The incidence density rates of leukaemia were 3.26 per 100 000 person-years for the enterovirus-infected and 5.84 per 100 000 person-years for the non-enterovirus-infected cohorts. The risk of leukaemia was significantly lower in the enterovirus-infected cohort than in the non-enterovirus-infected cohort (adjusted subhazard ratio [SHR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.31-0.60; p<0.0001). Children infected with enterovirus have a reduced risk of both lymphocytic leukaemia (adjusted SHR 0.44, 0.30-0.65; p<0.0001) and acute myeloid leukaemia (adjusted SHR 0.40, 0.17-0.97; p=0.04). Herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease were the main diseases associated with the reduced risk of leukaemia. INTERPRETATION: The association between enterovirus infection and the reduced risk of developing leukaemia supports Greaves' delayed infection hypothesis for the cause of childhood leukaemia.",,,['Lancet Oncol. 2015 Oct;16(13):1278-9.

Epub 2015 Aug 29.,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, a malignant B cell lymphoma. BLV has spread worldwide and causes serious problems. After infection, the BLV genome is integrated into the host DNA and can be amplified during periods of latency. We previously designed degenerate primers using the Coordination of Common Motifs (CoCoMo) algorithm to establish a new quantitative real-time PCR method (BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2) of measuring the proviral load of both known and novel BLV variants. Here, we aimed to examine the correlation between proviral load and risk factors for BLV infection, such as breeding systems, parousity, and colostrum feeding. Blood and serum samples were collected from 83 BLV-positive farms in 22 prefectures of Japan, and the BLV proviral load and anti-BLV antibody levels were measured. BLV was detected in 73.3% (1039/1,417) of cattle by BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2 and the provirus was detected in 93 of 1039 antibody-negative samples. The results showed that the proviral load increased with progression of lymphocytosis. Next, the risk factors associated with increasing BLV infection rate were examined along with any association with proviral load. The proviral load was higher in cattle with lymphocytosis than in healthy cattle, and higher in multiparous cows than in nulliparous cows. Finally, proviral loads were higher in contact breeding systems than in non-contact breeding systems. Taken together, these findings may help to formulate a plan for eliminating BLV from contaminated farms. This is the first nationwide study to estimate BLV proviral load in Japanese cattle.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we established a culture model that preferentially expands the MM SIX2+ progenitor pool using leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a Rho kinase inhibitor (ROCKi), and extracellular matrix. Passaged MM cells express the key stem cell regulators Six2 and Pax2 and remain competent to respond to WNT4 induction and form mature tubular epithelia and glomeruli. Mechanistically, LIF activates STAT, which binds to a Stat consensus sequence in the Six2 proximal promoter and sustains SIX2 levels. ROCKi, on the other hand, attenuates the LIF-induced differentiation activity of JNK. Concomitantly, the combination of LIF/ROCKi upregulates Slug expression and activates YAP, which maintains SIX2, PAX2, and SALL1.

Epub 2015 Aug 18.,"Acute myeloid leukemia is a clonal but heterogeneous disease differing in molecular pathogenesis, clinical features and response to chemotherapy. This latter frequently consists of a combination of cytarabine and anthracyclines, although etoposide, demethylating agents, and other drugs are also used. Unfortunately, chemoresistance is a common and serious problem. Multiple mechanisms account for impaired effectiveness of drugs and reduced levels of active agents in target cells. The latter can be due to lower drug uptake, increased export or decreased intracellular proportion of active/inactive agent due to changes in the expression/function of enzymes responsible for the activation of pro-drugs and the inactivation of active agents. Characterization of the ""resistome"", or profile of expressed genes accounting for multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype, would permit to predict the lack of response to chemotherapy and would help in the selection of the best pharmacological regime for each patient and moment, and to develop strategies of chemosensitization.",,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This success story has resulted in the development of multiple kinase inhibitors. We are currently facing significant limitations in implementing these kinase inhibitors into the clinic for the treatment of pediatric malignancies. As many hallmarks of cancer are known to be regulated by intracellular protein signaling networks, we suggest focusing on these networks to improve the implementation of kinase inhibitors. This viewpoint will provide a short overview of currently used strategies for the implementation of kinase inhibitors as well as reasons why kinase inhibitors have unfortunately not yet been widely used for the treatment of pediatric cancers.

Among several constructs, recombinant asparaginase isozyme II fused with the pelB signal sequence and five aspartate tag was secreted efficiently into culture medium at 34.6 U/mg cell of specific activity. By batch fermentation, recombinant E. coli produced 40.8 U/ml asparaginase isozyme II in the medium. In addition, deletion of the gspDE gene reduced extracellular production of asparaginase isozyme II, indicating that secretion of recombinant asparaginase isozyme II was partially ascribed to the recognition by the general secretion machinery.

The activity of H3K4-specific modification enzymes, in higher eukaryotes the MLL (or KMT2) family, is tightly regulated. The MLL family has six members, each with a specialized function. All contain a catalytic SET domain that associates with a core multiprotein complex for activation. These SET domains segregate into three classes that correlate with the arrangement of targeting domains that populate the rest of the protein. Here we show that, unlike MLL1, the MLL4 SET domain retains significant activity without the core complex. We also present the crystal structure of an inactive MLL4-tagged SET domain construct and describe conformational changes that account for MLL4 intrinsic activity. Finally, our structure explains how the MLL SET domains are able to add multiple methyl groups to the target lysine, despite having the sequence characteristics of a classical monomethylase.","['14-0362/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117584222/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, human)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

Epub 2015 Aug 29.,"The t(8;21) translocation is the most widespread genetic defect found in human acute myeloid leukemia. This translocation results in the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene that produces a wide variety of alternative transcripts and influences the course of the disease. The rules of combinatorics and splicing of exons in the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts are not known. To address this issue, we developed an exon graph model of the fusion gene organization and evaluated its local exon combinatorics by the exon combinatorial index (ECI). Here we show that the local exon combinatorics of the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene follows a power-law behavior and (i) the vast majority of exons has a low ECI, (ii) only a small part is represented by ""exons-hubs"" of splicing with very high ECI values, and (iii) it is scale-free and very sensitive to targeted skipping of ""exons-hubs"". Stochasticity of the splicing machinery and preferred usage of exons in alternative splicing can explain such behavior of the system. Stochasticity may explain up to 12% of the ECI variance and results in a number of non-coding and unproductive transcripts that can be considered as a noise. Half-life of these transcripts is increased due to the deregulation of some key genes of the nonsense-mediated decay system in leukemia cells. On the other hand, preferred usage of exons may explain up to 75% of the ECI variability. Our analysis revealed a set of splicing-related cis-regulatory motifs that can explain ""attractiveness"" of exons in alternative splicing but only when they are considered together. Cis-regulatory motifs are guides for splicing trans-factors and we observed a leukemia-specific profile of expression of the splicing genes in t(8;21)-positive blasts. Altogether, our results show that alternative splicing of the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts follows strict rules and that the power-law component of the fusion gene organization confers a high flexibility to this process.",,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is well established that CLL patients can have autoimmune complications, amongst them autoimmune hemolytic anemia as the most frequent. This study was carried out to determine the frequency of direct Coombs Test positivity in CLL patients and its possible correlation with Rai staging, hematological parameters and biochemical markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive cross sectional study was carried at Liaquat National Hospital from January 2011 to June 2013. Sixty untreated patients with B- chronic lymphoid leukemia were enrolled. Complete blood count, direct Coombs test, serum urea, creatinine, uric acid and LDH levels were determined. Data were compiled and analyzed using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: Out of 60 patients, 42(70%) were males and 18(30%) were females. Mean age was 59+/-9.2 years. Male to female ratio was 2.1: 1. The frequency of direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positivity was found to be 23.3%. The monospecific IgG was positive in 11 patients (18.3%); C3d positivity was evident in 1 patient (1.6%) and 2 patients (3.3%) had dual IgG and C3d positivity. The mean hemoglobin was 10.8+/-2.4gm/ dl. Significantly low mean hemoglobin of 8.3+/-3.0 gm/dl was seen in Coombs positive patients compared with negative patients having a mean hemoglobin level of 11.7+/-1.6 gm/dl (P<0.001). DAT positivity also demonstrated a positive association with advanced Rai stage III disease (P<0.01). No associations were noted with age, gender and biochemical markers. CONCLUSIONS: Direct Coombs test positivity in CLL in our patients, unlike in Western studies, appears relatively high, indicating significant autoimmune hemolytic anemia and advanced Rai stage in our setting.

Of the 145 eligible patients receiving 893 chemotherapy sessions, 46.9% were female, median age was 52 years, and the most common HM diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (46.2%). Febrile neutropenia (FN) occurred in 14.9% of chemotherapy sessions with an incidence of 24.8 per 1,000 chemotherapy cycles per year. Independent factors associated with FN were receiving the first chemotherapy cycle [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 4.1], having hemoglobin </=100 g/L (aHR 3.7) and platelet </=140,000/muL (aHR 2.7) on chemotherapy day and receiving acute myeloid leukemia regimens (aHR 20.8). Granulocyte colony stimulating factor was significantly associated with reduced rate of FN when given in those receiving CHOP regimen.

Natural killer (NK) cells reconstitute in the first months following HSCT when leukemia burden is at its lowest, but ALL cells have been shown to be resistant to NK cell-mediated killing. We show here that this resistance is overcome by NK cell stimulation with TLR-9-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). NK cell priming with activated pDCs resulted in TRAIL and CD69 up-regulation on NK cells and IFN-gamma production. NK cell activation was dependent on IFN-alpha produced by pDCs, but was not reproduced by IFN-alpha alone. ALL killing was further enhanced by inhibition of KIR engagement. We showed that ALL lysis was mainly mediated by TRAIL engagement, while the release of cytolytic granules was involved when ALL expressed NK cell activating receptor ligands. Finally, adoptive transfers of activated-pDCs in ALL-bearing humanized mice delayed the leukemia onset and cure 30% of mice. Our data therefore demonstrate that TLR-9 activated pDCs are a powerful tool to overcome ALL resistance to NK cell-mediated killing and to reinforce the GvL effect of HSCT.

Epub 2015 Aug 28.,"CD9, a member of the tetraspanin family, has been implicated in hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell homing. We investigated the role of CD9 in the dissemination of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells, by stably downregulating CD9 in REH and NALM6 cells. CD9 expression was associated with higher levels of REH cell adhesion to fibronectin and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-mediated migration. Death occurred later in NOD/SCID mice receiving REH cells depleted of CD9 for transplantation than in mice receiving control cells. After C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) stimulation, CD9 promoted the formation of long cytoplasmic actin-rich protrusions. We demonstrated that CD9 enhanced RAC1 activation, in both REH cells and blasts from patients. Conversely, the overexpression of a competing CD9 C-terminal tail peptide in REH cytoplasm decreased RAC1 activation and cytoplasmic extension formation in response to CXCL12. Finally, the inhibition of RAC1 activation decreased migration in vitro, and the depletion of RAC1 protein from transplanted REH cells increased mouse survival. Furthermore, a testis-conditioned medium induced the migration of REH and NALM6 cells, and this migration was impeded by an anti-CD9 antibody. The level of CD9 expression also influenced the homing of these cells in mouse testes. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that CD9 plays a key role in the CXCR4-mediated migration and engraftment of B-ALL cells in the bone marrow or testis, through RAC1 activation.",,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cd9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rac1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological evaluation in different cell-based assays revealed an antiproliferative activity for some analogues already in the nanomolar range against leukaemia, breast and renal cancer cell lines. To explain these effects, the most promising analogues of the series were engaged in further cell-based studies. Compounds 5e, l, p and 6a, b highlighted a pro-apoptotic potential being able to induce apoptosis in HL60, K562 and MCF-7 cell lines in a dose and time-dependent manner.

Epub 2015 Aug 18.,"Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (hereafter called omacetaxine) is a modified cephalotaxine and is registered (Synribo((R))) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of omacetaxine, sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays for the quantification of omacetaxine and its inactive 4'-des-methyl (4'-DMHHT) and cephalotaxine metabolites in human plasma and urine were developed and validated. Since omacetaxine is mainly metabolised by esterases, the plasma samples were immediately stabilised after collection with an esterase inhibitor and stored at a nominal temperature of -80 degrees C. Urine samples were stored at -80 degrees C immediately after collection. Protein precipitation was applied as the sample pretreatment method for the plasma samples, and urine samples were processed using solid-phase extraction (SPE). For both assays, the dried and reconstituted extracts were injected on a XBridge BEH Phenyl column for analysis of all analytes. Gradient elution was applied with 0.1% formic acid in water and methanol as mobile phases. Analytes were ionised using a turbospray ionisation source in positive mode and detected with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The validated plasma assay quantifies all analytes in the concentration range of 0.1-100ng/mL and the urine assay in the range of 0.1-50ng/mL. At all concentrations, the accuracies were within +/-15% of the nominal concentrations and precisions were </=15%. The developed methods have successfully been applied in a human mass balance study of omacetaxine.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The regulation of the IKK/NF-kappaB signaling in HTLV-1-transformed T cells remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we showed that the autophagy molecule Beclin1 not only executed a cytoprotective function through induction of autophagy but also played a pivotal role in maintaining Tax-induced activation of two key survival factors, NF-kappaB and Stat3. Silencing Beclin1 in HTLV-1-transformed T cells resulted in diminished activities of NF-kappaB and Stat3 as well as impaired growth. In Beclin1-depleted cells, Tax failed to activate NF-kappaB and Stat3 at its full capacity. In addition, we showed that Beclin1 interacted with the catalytic subunits of IKK. Further, we observed that selective inhibition of IKK repressed the activities of both NF-kappaB and Stat3 in the context of HTLV-1-transformation of T cells. Our data, therefore, unveiled a key role of Beclin1 in maintaining persistent activities of both NF-kappaB and Stat3 in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis.","['R01 AI090113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI090113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In an archival study of 30 children (mean transplant age = 6 years), we characterize neuropsychological predictors of academic outcomes. Mean intellectual and academic abilities were average, but evidenced extreme variability, particularly on measures of attention and memory: approximately 25% of the sample exhibited borderline performance or lower. Medical predictors of outcome revealed paradoxically better memory associated with more severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and associated with steroid treatment. Processing speed and memory accounted for 69% and 61% of variance in mathematics and reading outcomes, respectively.

Molecules that can interfere with PPI are required as laboratory tools to dissect function, as lead drug surrogates for target validation and as templates for drug discovery. We describe enhanced developments to Intracellular Antibody Capture (IAC) technology that can select antibody fragments able to interact with targets in cells. This is illustrated by the isolation of single heavy chain variable region domains binding to the basic-helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper region of the CMYC oncogenic protein. The enhanced IAC (eIAC) methodology deploys screening in yeast cells of a single diverse library initially with randomization only of CDR3. Further sequential randomization of CDR2 and CDR1 of three independently selected anti-CMYC clones illustrates an in vivo affinity maturation process. This concise eIAC approach facilitates the rapid selection of antibody fragments to explore the proteome interaction spectrum of mammalian cells and disease targeting.","['G0600914/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U105178807/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/17/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Single-Domain Antibodies)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015.

METHODS: The amplification and expression of HMGA2 were examined by FISH, qRT-PCR and Western blot in AML cases. The effect of HMGA2 knockdown on cell proliferation was analyzed with XTT, colony-forming assays and BrdUrd incorporation assays. The effects of HMGA2 knockdown on cell cycle were studied by flow cytometry analysis. The progression of AML cells in vivo was examined by the xenografted tumor model. The interaction between Akt pathway and HMGA2 was examined by Western blot. RESULTS: HMGA2 is amplified in AML, and the levels of HMGA2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressed in AML cells were significantly higher than those in normal cells, which may be related to NR and prognosis of AML patients. Reduction in HMGA2 expression in AML cells inhibited cell proliferation through a decrease in the protein expression of pAkt and pmTOR, compared with control cells. CONCLUSIONS: HMGA2 is predominantly amplified and expressed in AML cells, and that aberrant expression of HMGA2 induces AML cell proliferation through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

Epub 2015 Aug 18.,"The novel genetic information gained from genome-wide high throughput techniques has greatly improved our understanding of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). PTCL consists of numerous distinct entities and is currently diagnosed using a combination of clinical and morphologic features and immunophenotyping together with limited molecular assays leading to an often fragmented, complicated diagnostic system. The diagnosis of many cases is challenging even for expert hematopathologists and more than a third of the cases cannot be further classified and thus put into the PTCL-NOS category. Gene expression profiling (GEP) has significantly improved the molecular classification of PTCLs and identified robust molecular signatures for common nodal subtypes of PTCL including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic T-cell lymphoma (ALCL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and extra-nodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). These studies also led to identification of novel molecular subtypes with distinct prognosis, that otherwise could not be identified by conventional methods. Integration of massive sequencing strategies and gene expression has characterized driver genetic alterations in common subtypes like AITL, ALCL, ENKTL and other PTCLs. These studies have identified oncogenic pathways and genes affected in specific disease subtypes that can be potentially targeted by specific therapies. Novel treatment options with FDA approved drugs directed towards mutant IDH2, the NF-kappaB, JAK/STAT, or mTOR pathways illustrate the usefulness of genome-wide techniques to identify targets for therapy. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the molecular diagnosis and prognosis of PTCL using these genome-wide techniques.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['Copyright (c) 2015.

Epub 2015 Aug 29.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of site-specific and overall malignancies after SLE and explore the potential influencing factors. METHODS: We searched electronic databases for articles that assessed the risk of malignancies after SLE through February 2015. We extracted the incidence rates (IRs) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). We used random effects models to calculate the pooled IRs and assessed the impact of study designs, region, gender, age and duration of follow-up. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included, giving a pooled IR of 1.44 (95 % CI 1.23-1.69). Europeans, Americans and Asians showed a IR of 1.56 (95 % CI 1.07-2.28), 1.18 (95 % CI 1.01-1.39) and 1.62 (95 % CI 1.38-1.89), respectively. Males and females (eight studies) demonstrated a IR of 1.34 (95 % CI 1.07-1.67) and 1.51 (95 % CI 1.20-1.90), respectively. Prospective and retrospective studies showed a IR of 1.55 (95 % CI 0.97-2.47) and 1.44 (95 % CI 1.21-1.73), respectively. An increment of 10 years of age conferred a decrease in IR of 0.6. An increment of 5 years of SLE duration conferred a decrease in IR of 2.5. An increased IR of malignancies was observed in NHL, vagina/vulva, hematology, head/neck, leukemia, thyroid, liver/gallbladder, kidney, anal, cervix, esophagus, lung and pancreas. A decreased IR of malignancies was observed in ovary and colon/rectum. CONCLUSIONS: SLE patients had an increased risk of developing overall malignancies, particularly among Asians and females. Age and SLE duration are inversely associated with the risk of overall malignancies. SLE patients showed a different role in the onset of various site-specific malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 28.,"Arabinocytosine (AraC, also known as cytarabine) is one of the mainstays of AML therapy, but like other DNA damaging therapeutic agents it is rarely curative by itself. There is an emerging realization that the therapeutic outcomes may be improved by combining AraC with other compounds. Here we report that the addition of a differentiating agent combination immediately following AraC damage to AML blasts, selectively increases the cell kill. The experiments were performed using cultured cells from established cell lines of AML (HL60 and U937). The cells were exposed to 100nM AraC, a concentration which produced approximately 25-50% cell kill, followed by a combination of 100nM 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D2 (1-D2) and 10muM carnosic acid (CA), which together can serve as a powerful differentiating agent combination for AML cells, but are not toxic alone. AraC-induced cell death, measured by annexin V/propidium iodide, was significantly (p<0.01) increased by the 1-D2/CA combination in both cell lines, but not by 1-D2 or CA alone. The enhancement of cell death occurred by both apoptosis and necrosis, was associated with increased DNA damage and with higher levels of DNA damage response (DDR) activated marker Chk1, but the expression of p27, a cell cycle inhibitor protein, was not enhanced by 1-D2/CA. The principal finding is that a vitamin D analog 1-D2 combined with a plant-derived antioxidant CA can markedly augment the cytotoxic action of AraC, an anti-leukemia therapeutic agent.",['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '3DIZ9LF5Y9 (1 alpha-hydroxyergocalciferol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Aug 28.,"Unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) provides a curative therapy for patients with hematological malignancies. The effect of HLA mismatches in UCBT is currently the subject of debate. HLA-mismatched UCBT may lead to improved leukemia control but also to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), resulting in nonrelapse mortality (NRM). The aim of this study was to investigate whether indirect recognition of mismatched HLA provides an explanation for the graft-versus-tumor effect and risk of GVHD. The probability of indirect recognition was predicted by the Predicted Indirectly ReCognizable HLA Epitopes (PIRCHE) model. The effect of the numbers of PIRCHE presented on HLA class I and II (PIRCHE-I and -II) was studied in 134 pediatric patients. To study the effects of higher numbers of PIRCHE, patients were divided in 2 equally sized groups, using the median number of PIRCHE as cutoff values. Proportional hazard models and competing risk analyses were performed to study the effect of PIRCHE on the clinical outcomes relapse, acute and chronic GVHD, NRM, and disease-free and overall survival. Above median PIRCHE-I were associated with reduced relapse risk (HR, .26; 95% CI, .07 to .94; P = .04), evaluating the 50 patients transplanted for a malignancy. Both PIRCHE-I and -II were not associated with other clinical outcomes, including GVHD and NRM. These data suggest that high PIRCHE-I may lead to improved graft-versus-tumor effects after UCBT, without an accompanying GVHD risk. Inclusion of PIRCHE in UCB selection criteria may enhance UCBT outcome, which needs to be tested in prospective studies.",,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, not all lymphocytoses are leukemic. In addition, first-degree relatives of CLL patients have an ~15 % chance of developing a precursor condition to CLL termed monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), and distinguishing CLL and MBL B lymphocytes from normal B cell expansions can be a challenge. Therefore, we selected FMOD, CKAP4, PIK3C2B, LEF1, PFTK1, BCL-2, and GPM6a from a set of genes significantly differentially expressed in microarray analyses that compared CLL cells with normal B lymphocytes and used these to determine whether we could discriminate CLL and MBL cells from B cells of healthy controls. Analysis with receiver operating characteristics and Bayesian relevance determination demonstrated good concordance with all panel genes. Using a random forest classifier, the seven-gene panel reliably distinguished normal polyclonal B cell populations from expression patterns occurring in pre-CLL and CLL B cell populations with an error rate of 2 %. Using Bayesian learning, the expression levels of only two genes, FMOD and PIK3C2B, correctly distinguished 100 % of CLL and MBL cases from normal polyclonal and mono/oligoclonal B lymphocytes. Thus, this study sets forth effective computational approaches that distinguish MBL/CLL from normal B lymphocytes.

Epub 2015 Jul 26.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment for ALL has evolved in recent decades and as a result survival rates are now close to 90% in many developed countries. However, this is not the case in developing countries where survival rates are often below 35%. More than 80% of children who are affected by ALL worldwide live in developing countries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the secular trend in mortality for children with ALL living in Sergipe, a state in northeastern Brazil, and to investigate any association with variables that relate to socioeconomic status. METHOD: This study evaluated ALL patients who were less than 20 years of age and who were treated at the Dr. Osvaldo Leite Oncology Center in the capital city, Aracaju. The sample comprised two cohorts of patients from the public health service: patients treated from 1980 to 2004 (cohort A) and from 2005 to 2014 (cohort B). The findings were compared to those of patients treated in the one private service for pediatric cancer treatment available in the region, from 2005 to 2014 (cohort C). Two categories of variables were considered in this study: biological and socioeconomic. RESULTS: We analyzed 412 patients who were divided into three cohorts (cohort A: 287 patients, cohort B: 106 patients and cohort C: 19 patients). The mortality rates for the three cohorts were significantly different: 57.5% in cohort A, 45.3% in cohort B and 26.3% in cohort C (p=0.006). Mortality during induction in cohort B was 22.6%, while in cohort C no deaths occurred during this phase (p=0.041). Patients living in rural areas had higher mortality rates (p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in deaths from infection during induction seems to be the starting point for improving the chances for children and adolescents with ALL anywhere in the world.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of STD in human leukemia cells. The role of Fas (CD95), ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) and p38 kinase during STD-induced apoptosis was examined in human leukemia cells. In addition, the antitumor effects of STD in K562 and HL-60 leukemia xenograft models were investigated. We found that STD induces Fas translocation to lipid rafts, and thus mediates cell apoptosis. We also observed the activation of CerS6 and p38 kinase during STD-induced apoptosis. The use of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and nystatin to disrupt lipid rafts prevents the clustering of Fas and the activation of CerS6 and p38 kinase, and also inhibits STD-induced apoptosis. Specific inhibition by Fas, CerS6, and p38 kinase siRNA transfection partially blocked STD-induced apoptosis. In addition, STD has antitumor activity through the activation of CerS6 and p38 kinase without displaying any toxicity in HL-60 and K562 xenograft models. We observed that the anti-tumor effect of STD is partially prevented in CerS6 shRNA-silenced xenograft models. We first report that Fas/CerS6/p38 kinase activation in lipid rafts by STD is involved in its anti-leukemic activity. We also established that STD is able to enhance the chemosensitivity of K562 cells to etoposide or Ara-C.

The protein encoded by G0S2 is an endogenous inhibitor of lipid catabolism that directly binds adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). ATGL is the rate-limiting step in triglyceride metabolism. Although the G0S2 gene is silenced in cancer, the impact of ATGL in the growth and survival of cancer cells has never been addressed. Here we show that ectopic expression of G0S2 in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCL) inhibits triglyceride catabolism and results in lower cell growth. Similarly, knockdown of ATGL increased triglyceride levels, attenuated cell growth and promoted apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous G0S2 enhanced the growth and invasiveness of cancer cells. G0S2 is strongly induced in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells in response to all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and we show that inhibition of ATGL in these cells by G0S2 is required for efficacy of ATRA treatment. Our data uncover a novel tumor suppressor mechanism by which G0S2 directly inhibits activity of a key intracellular lipase.

In this mechanism, the BH1-3 domains of Bcl-2 form a hydrophobic pocket, binding and inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bim. In the other mechanism, the BH4 domain mediates interaction of Bcl-2 with inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), inhibiting pro-apoptotic Ca2+ signals. The current anti-Bcl-2 agents, ABT-263 (Navitoclax) and ABT-199 (Venetoclax), induce apoptosis by displacing pro-apoptotic proteins from the hydrophobic pocket, but do not inhibit Bcl-2-IP3R interaction. Therefore, to target this interaction we developed BIRD-2 (Bcl-2 IP3 Receptor Disruptor-2), a decoy peptide that binds to the BH4 domain, blocking Bcl-2-IP3R interaction and thus inducing Ca2+-mediated apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and follicular lymphoma cells, including cells resistant to ABT-263, ABT-199, or the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor Ibrutinib. Moreover, combining BIRD-2 with ABT-263 or ABT-199 enhances apoptosis induction compared to single agent treatment.

Previous studies reported that ribavirin could suppress eIF4E-controlled translation and reduce the synthesis of onco-proteins. Here, we investigated the anti-leukemic effects of ribavirin alone or in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) leukemia cell lines SUP-B15 (Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Ph+ ALL) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, CML). Our results showed that ribavirin had anti-proliferation effect; it down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of Akt, mTOR, 4EBP1, and eIF4E proteins in the mTOR/eIF4E signaling pathway, and MEK, ERK, Mnk1 and eIF4E proteins in ERK/Mnk1/eIF4E signaling pathway; reduced the expression of Mcl-1 (a translation substrates of eIF4F translation initiation complex) at protein synthesis level not mRNA transcriptional level; and induced cell apoptosis in both SUP-B15 and K562. 7-Methyl-guanosine cap affinity assay further demonstrated that ribavirin remarkably increased the eIF4E binding to 4EBP1 and decreased the combination of eIF4E with eIF4G, consequently resulting in a major inhibition of eIF4F complex assembly. The combination of ribavirin with imatinib enhanced antileukemic effects mentioned above, indicating that two drugs have synergistic anti-leukemic effect. Consistent with the cell lines, similar results were observed in Ph+ acute lymphoblastic primary leukemic blasts; however, the anti-proliferative role of ribavirin in other types of acute primary leukemic blasts was not obvious, which indicated that the anti-leukemic effect of ribavirin was different in cell lineages.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MKNK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma occurs more frequently in immunocompromised patients, especially in those receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy. Patients usually manifest hepatosplenomegaly without lymphadenopathy. The bone marrow is also involved in two-thirds of cases and is often accompanied by circulating lymphoma cells, which, along with anemia and thrombocytopenia, may raise suspicion for acute leukemia.

Using a stable and sensitive workflow based on LC-MS, we quantitatively compared the extents of methylation and acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in acute leukemia cell line HL60 and its doxorubicin-resistant derivative, HL60/ADR, as well as the chronic leukemia cell line K562 and its doxorubicin-resistant derivative, K562/ADR. We found that increased levels of H3K9 methylation, H3K14, H3K18 and H3K23 acetylation, and potentially H4K20 methylation, are associated with drug resistance in both cells.

The aims of this study were to evaluate FLI-1 immunohistochemical expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and its relationships between the clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis. We investigated the FLI-1 expression in 108 cases of NSCLC by using multiple tumor microarrays. Correlations between the FLI-1 expression and clinicopathologic parameters and prognostic significance were analyzed. The effect of FLI-1 expression on survival is estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Our results revealed that patients with high FLI-1 expression had shorter overall survival (P=0.014) than those with low FLI-1 expression. In multivariate analysis, FLI-1 was confirmed as an independent poor prognostic factor in NSCLC (overall survival: hazard ratio, 7.292; 95% confidence interval, 0.294-0.823; P=0.007). In conclusion, this study shows that FLI-1 is expressed variably in different subtypes of NSCLC, and its expression is related to clinicopathologic parameters and poorer prognosis.

It is known that in chronic lymphocytic and acute myeloid leukemias the reduced apoptosis is strongly related with the activity of calpain-calpastatin system (CCS) composed of cytoplasmic proteases--calpains--performing the modulatory proteolysis of key proteins involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, and of their endogenous inhibitor--calpastatin. Here, the CCS protein abundance and activity was for the first time studied in childhood ALL blasts and in control bone marrow CD19+ B cells by semi-quantitative flow cytometry and western blotting of calpastatin fragments resulting from endogenous calpain activity. Significantly higher mu-calpain (CAPN1) gene transcription, protein amounts and activity (but not those of m-calpain), with calpastatin amount and transcription of its gene (CAST) greatly varying were observed in CD19(+) ALL blasts compared to control cells. Significant inverse relation between the amount/activity of calpain and spontaneous apoptosis was noted. Patients older than 10 years (considered at higher risk) displayed increased amounts and activities of blast calpain. Finally, treatment of blasts with the tripeptide calpain inhibitors II and IV significantly and in dose-dependent fashion increased the percentage of blasts entering apoptosis.

The impact of obesity on adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC), which contribute to the formation of tumor stroma, is unknown. Here we hypothesized that visceral source and diet-induced obesity (DIO) changes the ASC phenotype, contributing to the tumor promoting effects of obesity. We found that ASC isolated from subcutaneous (SC-ASC) and visceral (V-ASC) white adipose tissue(WAT) of lean(Le) and obese(Ob) mice exhibited similar mesenchymal cell surface markers expression, and had comparable effects on ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Obese and visceral derived ASC proliferated slower and exhibited impaired differentiation into adipocytes and osteocytes in vitro as compared to ASC derived from subcutaneous WAT of lean mice. Intraperitoneal co-injection of ovarian cancer cells with obese or visceral derived ASC, but not lean SC-ASC, increased growth of intraperitoneal ID8 tumors as compared to controls. Obese and V-ASC increased stromal infiltration of inflammatory cells, including CD3+ T cells and F4/80+ macrophages. Obese and visceral derived ASC, but not lean SC-ASC, increased expression of chemotactic factors IL-6, MIP-2, and MCP-1 when cultured with tumor cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that obese and V-ASC have a unique phenotype, with more limited proliferation and differentiation capacity but enhanced expression of chemotactic factors in response to malignant cells which support infiltration of inflammatory cells and support tumor growth and dissemination.",['P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Chemokines)']",,,,,,['PLoS One. 2015;10(11):e0143019.

Precise diagnosis is essential in order to differentiate classic forms from HCL variants, such as the HCL-variant and VH4-34 molecular variant, which are more resistant to available treatments. The current standard of care is treatment with purine analogs (PAs), such as cladribine or pentostatin, which provide a high rate of long-lasting clinical remissions. Nevertheless, ~30%-40% of the patients relapse, and moreover, some of these are difficult-to-treat refractory cases. The use of the monoclonal antibody rituximab in combination with PA appears to produce even higher responses, and it is often employed to minimize or eliminate residual disease. Currently, research in the field of HCL is focused on identifying novel therapeutic targets and potential agents that are safe and can universally cure the disease. The discovery of the BRAF mutation and progress in understanding the biology of the disease has enabled the scientific community to explore new therapeutic targets. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing various treatment strategies such as the combination of PA and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, recombinant immunotoxins targeting CD22, BRAF inhibitors, and B-cell receptor signal inhibitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study compared 55 ALL survivors, of chronological age between 15 years and 24 years, assigned into two groups according to the exposure to cranial radiation therapy (CRT; 25 irradiated and 30 nonirradiated) with 24 leukemia-free controls, and assessed body fat mass (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), computed tomography scan-derived abdominal adipose tissue, lipid profile, blood pressure (BP), adipokines, and cIMT by a multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Treatment with CRT had an effect on all of the variables derived from the computed tomography scan: visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) (P<0.050). In a multiple linear regression model, cIMT positively correlated with exposure to CRT (P=0.029), diastolic BP (P=0.016), and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (P=0.048), while negatively related to SAT (P=0.007). CONCLUSION: In young survivors of childhood ALL, CRT modified the distribution of fat and played a critical role in determining cIMT. Leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, a biomarker of abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome, and diastolic BP also influenced cIMT, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, adiposity-associated vascular disease might be attenuated by SAT. Changes in body fat must be evaluated in this group of patients in the early course of survivorship in order to avoid premature cardiovascular disease associated with atherosclerosis. Yet, further research as regards the possible protective effect of SAT on vascular disease is warranted.",,"['0 (ADIPOQ protein, human)', '0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Leptin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adverse cutaneous reactions induced by imatinib are frequent, generally moderate, and dose-dependent. The aim of this work was to investigate the possible contribution of interleukin (IL)-33 and IL-31, cytokines involved in disorders associated with itching, in the pathogenesis of pruritus in a patient undergoing imatinib mesylate treatment. His IL-31 and IL-33 serum levels were significantly higher than in the control group (respectively 96.6 pg/mL vs. 7.623+/-7.681 pg/mL and 27.566 pg/mL vs. 6.170+/-7.060 pg/mL). In light of these findings, imatinib mesylate-related symptoms of dermatologic toxicities might be related to the release of IL-31 and IL-33. In particular, it is supposable that TKi usage could cause keratinocyte injury, the release of IL-33, and the consequent interaction with its receptor on mast cells that induces the secretion of several factors capable of causing skin manifestations, including IL-31, a known pruritus-inducing cytokine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted in 106 pediatric patients in whom 203 CVCs were inserted. A total of 175 catheter-related complications occurred in 5 years. RESULTS: The rates of clinical catheter infections, local catheter infections, venous thromboembolism, bleeding, and mechanical complications were 2.6, 1.1, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.2 per 1000 catheter days. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant infectious organism in blood and catheter cultures. The children with leukemia had a significantly higher frequency of clinical catheter infections (p=0.046). The children who underwent bone marrow transplantation had a significantly lower frequency of clinical catheter infections (p=0.043) and higher frequency of local catheter infections (p=0.003). The children with implanted catheters had a significantly lower frequency of clinical catheter infections (p=0.048). The children with thrombocytopenia had significantly fewer local catheter infections and significantly more clinical catheter infections and catheter-related bleeding (respectively p=0.001, p=0.042, and p=0.024). CONCLUSION: Leukemia, bone marrow transplantation, and thrombocytopenia are risk factors for CVC-associated complications. The relatively higher number of interventions performed via permanent catheters may be responsible for the significantly increased incidence of systemic infections and mechanical injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to clarify whether hypermethylation might be the cause of low WNT5A mRNA levels and whether we could restore this downregulation by reversing the event. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of WNT5A mRNA was studied in a large acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient group (n=86) by quantitative real-time PCR. The methylation status was detected by methylation-specific PCR (MSPCR) and bisulphate sequencing. In order to determine whether methylation has a direct effect on WNT5A expression, disease-representative cell lines were treated by 5'-aza-20-deoxycytidine. RESULTS: Here we designed a validation experiment of the WNT5A gene, which was previously examined and found to be differentially expressed by microarray study in 31 T-cell ALL patients. The expression levels were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and the expression levels were significantly lower in T-cell ALL patients than in control thymic subsets (p=0.007). MSPCR revealed that 86% of the patients were hypermethylated in the WNT5A promoter region. Jurkat and RPMI cell lines were treated with 5'-aza-20-deoxycytidine and WNT5A mRNA expression was restored after treatment. CONCLUSION: According to our results, WNT5A hypermethylation does occur in ALL patients and it has a direct effect on mRNA expression. Our findings show that epigenetic changes of WNT signaling can play a role in ALL pathogenesis and reversing methylation might be useful as a possible treatment of leukemia.",,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic effect of KL-21 was determined by MTT cell proliferation assay. Changes in caspase-3 enzyme activity were measured using the caspase-3 colorimetric assay. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were determined using the JC-1 dye-based method. Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was performed to measure the apoptotic cell population. Effects of KL-21 on cell cycle profiles of CLL cells were investigated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We detected time- and concentration-dependent increases in the cytotoxic effect of KL-21 on 232B4 CLL cells. However, we also showed that, especially at higher concentrations, KL-21 was less cytotoxic towards BEAS-2B healthy cells than towards CLL cells. Annexin-V/PI double staining results showed that the apoptotic cell population increased in 232B4 cells. Increasing concentrations of KL-21 increased caspase-3 enzyme activity and induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. KL-21 administration resulted in small increases in the percentage of the cells in the G0/G1 phase while it decreased the S phase cell population up to 1 mg/mL. At the highest concentration, most of the cells accumulated in the G0/G1 phase. CONCLUSION: KL-21 has a growth-inhibitory effect on 232B4 CLL cells.

Epub 2015 Aug 28.,"The Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of cell cycle, proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. FOXM1 is overexpressed in many human tumors and its upregulation has been linked to high proliferation rates and poor prognosis. We therefore studied the role of FOXM1 in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in order to understand whether FOXM1 could be a key target for leukemia therapy. RT-PCR and western blot analysis were carried out in a small cohort of pediatric B-ALL patients to evaluate FOXM1 levels. To assess its biological relevance, its expression was down-modulated by transient RNA interference in B-ALL cell lines (REH and NALM-6). Our results show that FOXM1 expression is higher in both B-ALL patients and cell lines when compared to PBMC or normal B-cells (CD19+) from healthy donors. Furthermore, blocking FOXM1 activity in two B-ALL cell lines, by either knockdown or treatment with the FOXM1 inhibitor thiostrepton, causes significant decrease in their cell proliferation. This decrease in cell proliferation was coupled with both an induction of the G2/M cell cycle arrest and with a reduction in the S phase population. Finally, we noted how thiostrepton synergises with chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in B-ALL therapy, thus increasing their efficiency. Therefore our results suggest that FOXM1 is highly expressed in both patients and B-ALL cell lines, and that targeting FOXM1 could be an attractive strategy for leukemia therapy and for overcoming drug resistance.",['12011/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 27.,"To evaluate the effect of first-line and subsequent therapies, the outcome of 1,558 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia from five prospective phase II/III trials conducted between 1999 and 2010 was analyzed. The 3-year overall survival rate was higher after first-line treatment with chemoimmunotherapies such as fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (87.9%) or bendamustine/rituximab (90.7%) compared to chemotherapies without an antibody (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide: 84.6%; fludarabine: 77.5%; chlorambucil: 77.4%). Furthermore, the median overall survival was longer in patients receiving at least one antibody-containing regimen in any treatment line (94.4 months) compared to the survival in patients who never received an antibody (84.3 months, P<0.0001). Univariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients who did receive antibody treatment had a 1.42-fold higher risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval: 1.185-1.694). Therapies administered at relapse were very heterogeneous. Only 55 of 368 patients (14.9%) who started second-line treatment >24 months after first-line therapy repeated the first-line regimen. Among 315 patients requiring treatment </=24 months after first-line therapy, cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone with or without rituximab as well as alemtuzumab were the most commonly used therapies. In these early relapsing patients, the median overall survival was shorter following therapies containing an anthracycline and/or three or more cytotoxic agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone or fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/mitoxantrone, 30.0 months) compared to single agent chemotherapy (e.g. fludarabine; 39.6 months) and standard chemoimmunotherapy (e.g. fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab: 61.6 months). In conclusion, the analysis confirms the superior efficacy of chemoimmunotherapies in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, the use of aggressive chemo(immuno)therapy combinations in patients with an early relapse does not offer any benefit when compared to less intensive therapies.

However, attempts to determine the modification site(s), whether endogenously expressed in mammalian cells, or recombinant proteins, did not lead to unequivocal results. Comparative ESI-MS/analysis of IEF fractions of TS preparations from parental and FdUrd-resistant mouse leukemia L1210 cells, differing in sensitivity to inactivation by FdUMP, demonstrated phosphorylation of Ser(10) and Ser(16) in the resistant enzyme only, although PGS staining pointed to the modification of both L1210 TS proteins. The TS proteins phosphorylated in bacterial cells were shown by (31)P NMR to be modified only on histidine residues, like potassium phosphoramidate (KPA)-phosphorylated TS proteins. NanoLC-MS/MS, enabling the use of CID and ETD peptide fragmentation methods, identified several phosphohistidine residues, but certain phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues were also implicated. Molecular dynamics studies, based on the mouse TS crystal structure, allowed one to assess potential of several phosphorylated histidine residues to affect catalytic activity, the effect being phosphorylation site dependent.",,['EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)'],,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To better inform the results of clinical trials, there is a need to identify and systematically assess biomarkers of response and pharmacodynamic markers of successful target engagement. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a candidate therapeutic target in AML. Small-molecule inhibitors of SYK induce AML differentiation and impair leukemia progression in preclinical studies. However, tools to predict response to SYK inhibition and to routinely evaluate SYK activation in primary patient samples have been lacking. In this study we quantified phosphorylated SYK (P-SYK) in AML cell lines and establish that increasing levels of baseline P-SYK are correlated with an increasing sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors targeting SYK. In addition, we found that pharmacological inhibition of SYK activity extinguishes P-SYK expression as detected by an immunohistochemical (IHC) test. Quantitative analysis of P-SYK expression by the IHC test in a series of 70 primary bone marrow biopsy specimens revealed a spectrum of P-SYK expression across AML cases and that high P-SYK expression is associated with unfavourable outcome independent of age, cytogenetics, and white blood cell count. This study thus establishes P-SYK as a critical biomarker in AML that identifies tumors sensitive to SYK inhibition, identifies an at-risk patient population, and allows for the monitoring of target inhibition during treatment.",['R01 CA140292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 26.,"Murine leukaemia virus has been suggested to contribute to both autoimmune disease and leukaemia in the NZB mouse and in the (NZB x NZW) F1 (abbreviated B/W) mouse. However, with apparently only xenotropic but no ecotropic virus constitutively expressed in these mice, few mechanisms could explain the aetiology of either disease in either mouse strain. Because pseudotyped and/or inducible ecotropic virus may play a role, we surveyed the ability of murine leukaemia virus in NZB, NZW and B/W mice to infect and form a provirus. From the spleen of NZB mice, we isolated circular cDNA of xenotropic and polytropic virus, which indicates ongoing infection by these viruses. From a B/W lymphoma, we isolated and determined the complete sequence of a putative ecotropic NZW virus. From B/W mice, we recovered de novo endogenous retroviral integration sites (tags) from the hyperproliferating cells of the spleen and the peritoneum. The tagged genes seemed to be selected to aid cellular proliferation, as several of them are known cancer genes. The insertions are consistent with the idea that endogenous retrovirus contributes to B-cell hyperproliferation and progression to lymphoma in B/W mice.","['R01 AI041570/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI041570/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We systematically summarize the latest research progress on the significance of gene mutations for prognostic stratification of IR-AML. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a systemic search from the PubMed database up to October, 2014 using various search terms and their combinations including IR-AML, gene mutations, mutational analysis, prognosis, risk stratification, next generation sequencing (NGS). STUDY SELECTION: Clinical or basic research articles on NGS and the prognosis of gene mutations in IR-AML were included. RESULTS: The advent of the era of whole-genome sequencing has led to the discovery of an increasing number of molecular genetics aberrations that involved in leukemogenesis, and some of them have been used for prognostic risk stratification. Several studies have consistently identified that some gene mutations have prognostic relevance, however, there are still many controversies for some genes because of lacking sufficient evidence. In addition, tumor cells harbor hundreds of mutated genes and multiple mutations often coexist, therefore, single mutational analysis is not sufficient to make accurate prognostic predictions. The comprehensive analysis of multiple mutations based on sophisticated genomic technologies has raised increasing interest in recent years. CONCLUSIONS: NGS represents a pioneering and helpful approach to prognostic risk stratification of IR-AML patients. Further large-scale studies for comprehensive molecular analysis are needed to provide guidance and a theoretical basis for IR-AML prognostic stratification and clinical management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We applied a high-throughput deep-targeted analysis, especially designed for covering widely TP53 and ATM genes, in 180 patients with inactive disease at diagnosis, to test the independent prognostic value of CLL somatic recurrent mutations. We found that 40/180 patients harbored at least one acquired variant with ATM (n=17, 9.4%), NOTCH1 (n=14, 7.7%), TP53 (n=14, 7.7%) and SF3B1 (n=10, 5.5%) as most prevalent mutated genes. Harboring one 'sub-Sanger' TP53 mutation granted an independent 3.5-fold increase of probability of needing treatment. Those patients with a double-hit ATM lesion (mutation+11q deletion) had the shorter median time to first treatment (17 months). We found that a genomic variable: TP53 mutations, most of them under the sensitivity of conventional techniques; a cell phenotypic factor: CD38-positive expression; and a classical marker as beta2-microglobulin, remained as the unique independent predictors of outcome. The high-throughput determination of TP53 status, particularly in this set of patients frequently lacking high-risk chromosomal aberrations, emerges as a key step, not only for prediction modeling, but also for exploring mutation-specific therapeutic approaches and minimal residual disease monitoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the specific mechanism of PARP-1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unknown. Our study showed that expression of PARP-1 was upregulated in AML patients. PARP-1 inhibition slowed AML cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle, induced apoptosis in vitro and improved AML prognosis in vivo. Mechanistically, microarray assay of AML cells with loss of PARP-1 function revealed that the myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) was significantly downregulated. In human AML samples, MPL expression was increased, and gain-of-function and loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that MPL promoted cell growth. Moreover, PARP-1 and MPL expression were positively correlated in AML samples, and their overexpression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, PARP-1 and MPL consistently acted on Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, and the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic function observed with PARP-1 inhibition were reversed in part via MPL activation upon thrombopoietin stimulation or gene overexpression.

important role in controlling cancer cell survival. IAPs have therefore attracted considerable attention as potential targets in anticancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of AZD5582, a novel small-molecule IAP inhibitor, in human pancreatic cancer cells. Treating human pancreatic cancer cells with AZD5582 differentially induced apoptosis, dependent on the expression of p-Akt and p-XIAP. Moreover, the knockdown of endogenous Akt or XIAP via RNA interference in pancreatic cancer cells, which are resistant to AZD5582, resulted in increased sensitivity to AZD5582, whereas ectopically expressing Akt or XIAP led to resistance to AZD5582. Additionally, AZD5582 targeted cIAP1 to induce TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. More importantly, AZD5582 induced a decrease of Mcl-1 protein, a member of the Bcl-2 family, but not that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Interestingly, ectopically expressing XIAP and cIAP1 inhibited the AZD5582-induced decrease of Mcl-1 protein, which suggests that AZD5582 elicits Mcl-1 decrease for apoptosis induction by targeting of XIAP and cIAP1. Taken together, these results indicate that sensitivity to AZD5582 is determined by p-Akt-inducible XIAP phosphorylation and by targeting cIAP1. Furthermore, Mcl-1 in pancreatic cancer may act as a potent marker to analyze the therapeutic effects of AZD5582.",,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0', ""(N,N'-(2,2'-(hexa-2,4-diyne-1,6-diylbis(oxy))bis(2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diyl))"", 'bis(1-(2-cyclohexyl-2-(2-(methylamino)propanamido)acetyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxamid', 'e))', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) has shown a considerable efficacy in cGVHD treatment, which is based on the infusion of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected by aphesis, incubated with the photoactivable drug 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and UV-A irradiation. The therapeutic effect of ECP is mainly achieved by the induction of cell apoptosis, influencing the function of dendritic cells and the induction of immune tolerance. ECP has many advantages in the treatment of cGVHD, such as no increasing the risk of infection in patients, unaffecting the graft-versus-leukemia effect, nearly no side effect and so on. Many medical centers have done a lot of research on the treatment of cGVHD in both children and adults by using ECP and achieved good results. CD19(+) CD21(-) B lymphocytes, serum BAFF and serum TNFalpha can be used to measure and early evaluate the efficacy of ECP treatment. The effect of ECP is associated with many factors, and certain complications may occur during the treatment. At present, the application of ECP treatment is limited by the unclear mechanisms, varying treatment cycles in different studies, and small number of patients in clinical research. In the near future, with deeper basic research, increasing the case number and standard clinical treatment, ECP will have a more extensive application prospects. This review focuses mainly on the clinical advances of ECP in the treatment of cGVHD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Jurkat cells were treated with different concentrations of GI254023X, the proliferation-inhibition curve was assayed and plotted by CCK-8 method, the cell viability and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V and 7-AAD staining, the cleavage of Notch1 protein was determined by Western blot, the transcripts of anti-apoptotic genes BCL-2, MCL-1, BCL-xl and Notch1 target gene Hes-1 were detected by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The GI254023X obviously inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells in concentration-dependent manner. As compared with the control group, the apoptosis of cells increased along with increment of GI254023X concentration. Compared with control group, the expression of Cleaved Notch1 was down-regulated while the expression of Notch1 was up-regulated in a time-dependent manner after the treatment with GI254023X. The levels of MCL-1 and Hes-1 mRNA transcripts in Jurkat cells were reduced in GI254023X treated group, but did not show obvious effect on the level of BCL-2 and BCL-xl mRNA transcripts. CONCLUSION: GI254023X can remarkably inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells. The inhibition of Notch1 activation and the down-regulation of apoptosis-related gene MCL-1 may be involved in the process of apoptosis.",,"['0 (3-(formylhydroxyamino)-2-(3-phenyl-1-propyl)butanoic acid', '(2,2-dimethyl-1-methylcarbamoyl-1-propyl)amide)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch1 protein expression in L1210 cells were significantly decreased after treating with cytosine arabinoside of low and middle concentrations, but increased after treating with cytosine arabinoside of high concentration or prolonging time of cytosine arabinoside of middle con-centration. Notch1 protein expression in L1210 cells dereased after treating with dexamethasone, but did not be changed with the different concentrations and different times of dexmethason. CONCLUSION: The transcription level of Notch gene in CLL patients significantly higher than that in normal controls. The Notch1 protein expression is down-regulated in process of inhibiting L1210 cell proliferation by Ara-C and dexmethason. Notch signaling pathway may mediated anti-apoptosis and drug resistance of CLL cells. Notch molecule possibly plays an important role in the anti-apoptosis and drug-resistance of CLL cells.",,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the key for CAR T to take the gene which can identify the CD19 antigen of lymphoblastic leukemia into lymphocytes, enable it to kill leukemia cells with specific cell-surface loci. The same principle also applies to other aspects, if we find specific target genes of lymphocytes. Recent studies have found that high mobility group protein N2 (high mobility group chromosal protein N2, HMGN2) is the excellent target of tumor-associated antigen in lymphocytes, is the antitumor effector molecule of CD8(+) T cells, which has the ability of trends and specific identify/binding in myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, cervical cancer and other tumor cells. HMGN2 is expected to be used for the preparation of specific identification of tumor lymphocytes and to treat more leukemia and tumors.

METHODS: This article gives an overview of the currently available options and the clinical approach to the diagnostics and therapy of acute leukemia. RESULTS: The standardization as well as improvements in diagnostic procedures, in particular by immunocytological and genetic procedures, allow a more rapid determination of the exact diagnosis. In addition to age and performance status of patients, an established panel of cytogenetic and molecular markers allows an individual risk stratification for selecting the most appropriate therapeutic procedure for each patient. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger patients with genetically determined intermediate and poor risk status benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplantation whereas patients in the low risk group are still primarily treated with conventional induction chemotherapy with anthracycline and cytarabine. The poor prognosis of elderly patients with AML has been improved by the development of stem cell transplantation procedures with reduced intensity conditioning and for patients not suitable for stem cell transplantation, the introduction of less toxic demethylating substances allows a substantial improvement in outcome and quality of life compared to cytoreductive therapy alone. The additional role of targeted therapies in AML is still under investigation. In adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the standard systemic therapy still consists of complex cytotoxic regimens which have been modified from pediatric protocols. Biologically and genetically determined subgroups of ALL patients as well as poor responders, who can be identified by the detection of significant molecular determined residual disease (MRD) after standard therapy, benefit from allogeneic transplantation in first remission. In patients with bcr-abl positive ALL, the implementation of first and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has led to rapidly rising response rates and less toxicity. Patients with relapsed ALL may benefit from new molecular options, e.g. bispecific antibodies. Additionally, improved standardization and supportive care, particularly due to the introduction of modern antimycotic agents, increase the treatment options and improve the prognosis of patients with acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: The improved diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients with acute leukemia require a complex management. Currently only subgroups of patients benefit from molecular targeted therapeutic strategies. Due to this increasing complexity in the management, patients with acute leukemia should be treated in academic centers and within clinical trials.",,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,,Akute Leukamien des Erwachsenen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ganciclovir (GCV) is used for both prophylaxis and treatment of CMV disease with successful results, however GCV resistance has been increasingly reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the GCV resistance in patients whose viral loads did not decline (>/=1000 copies/mL) despite of receiving GCV treatment, by using sequence analysis method. A total of 30 patients, 25 of them were bone marrow transplant (BMT) and five who were followed in hematology clinics (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, combined immune deficiency, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) were included in the study. CMV-DNA levels were monitored by real-time polymerase chain reaction (QIAsymphony, Artus(R) CMV QS-RGQ kit, Qiagen, Germany), and DNA sequence analysis (ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, USA) was performed to detect the mutations leading to CMV antiviral drug resistance in following gene regions: 420-664 codons in UL97 gene region and 261 to 588 and 740 to 987 codons in UL54 gene region. Of 30 patients included, M460V mutation in CMV UL97 gene region was detected in one (3.3%) (1st case) and L802M mutation in UL54 gene region, in addition to P887S and S897L variant sequences in another patient (3.3%) (2nd case). The first patient was a 20-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia who underwent BMT. The blood sample for the investigation of antiviral drug resistance was taken on the 117th day of transplantation (with simultaneous viral load 4470 copies/mL) and the patient has been using GCV for 70 days when the sample was taken. Valganciclovir (VGCV) and foscarnet (FOS) were used for the therapy of the first patient and monitored. The second patient was a 19-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent BMT. The blood sample for the investigation of antiviral drug resistance was taken on the 109th day of transplantation (with simultaneous viral load 4830 copies/mL) and the patient received GCV for 26 days and VGCV for 40 days when the sample was taken. FOS and cidofovir were used for the therapy of the second patient but the patient was lost due to the underlying diseases. In conclusion, mutations responsible for GCV resistance was detected in 6.6% (2/30) of immunocompromised patients receiving GCV, indicating that the determination of CMV antiviral drug resistance may help clinicians for planning the antiviral therapy.",,,,,"Gansiklovir tedavisi alan immun yetmezlikli hastalarda, CMV UL54 ve UL97 gen bolgelerinde gansiklovir direncinin arastirilmasi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapies capable of providing long-term disease control in CLL patients with DDR defects are lacking. Using AZD6738, a novel ATR inhibitor, we investigated ATR pathway inhibition as a synthetically lethal strategy for targeting CLL cells with these defects. METHODS: The effect of AZD6738 was assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence of key DDR proteins. Cytotoxicity was assessed by CellTiter-Gloluminescence assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and by propidium iodide exclusion. Primary CLL cells with biallelic TP53 or ATM inactivation were xenotransplanted into NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgamma mice. After treatment with AZD6738 or vehicle, tumour load was measured by flow cytometric analysis of infiltrated spleens, and subclonal composition by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation for 17p(TP53) or 11q(ATM) deletion. FINDINGS: AZD6738 provided potent and specific inhibition of ATR signalling with compensatory activation of ATM/p53 pathway in cycling CLL cells in the presence of genotoxic stress. In p53 or ATM defective cells, AZD6738 treatment resulted in replication fork stalls and accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, as evidenced by gammaH2AX and 53BP1 foci formation, which was carried through into mitosis, resulting in cell death by mitotic catastrophe. AZD6738 displayed selective cytotoxicity towards ATM or p53 deficient CLL cells, and was highly synergistic in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. This finding was confirmed in primary xenograft models of DDR-defective CLL, where treatment with AZD6738 resulted in decreased tumour load and selective reduction of CLL subclones with ATM or TP53 alterations. INTERPRETATION: We have provided mechanistic insight and demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy of a novel therapeutic approach that specifically targets p53-null or ATM-null CLL cells. Such an approach can potentially help to avert clonal evolution, a major cause of therapeutic resistance and disease relapse.

It is known that the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) and MYC proteins cooperatively regulate expression of the HK2 and PDK1 genes, respectively, in the Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell line P493-6, carrying an inducible MYC gene repression system. However, the mechanism of aerobic glycolysis in BL cells has not yet been fully understood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Western blot analysis showed that the HIF1A protein was highly expressed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive BL cell lines. Using biochemical assays and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), we found that-unlike in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs)-the MYC protein was the master regulator of the Warburg effect in these BL cell lines. Inhibition of the transactivation ability of MYC had no influence on aerobic glycolysis in LCLs, but it led to decreased expression of MYC-dependent genes and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) activity in BL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg effect, in BL cells is regulated by MYC expressed at high levels, whereas in LCLs, HIF1A is responsible for this phenomenon.",,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (KIF2A protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (PDK1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study assessed neuropsychological function in very long-term childhood ALL survivors treated with chemotherapy only. We also investigated associations between neurocognitive performance and individual treatment load. PROCEDURE: One-hundred and twelve adult ALL survivors, diagnosed 1970-2002 before age 16 and treated with chemotherapy only, and 100 comparison peers underwent neuropsychological tests covering processing speed, executive functions, working memory, and verbal learning and memory. Individual cumulative doses of cytostatic agents were extracted from the medical records for each patient. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis for survivors was 6.3 years and mean follow-up time was 22.6 years. There was no difference in general intellectual ability between survivors and comparison peers. However, survivors performed significantly more poorly in the neurocognitive domains' processing speed (P = 0.003, Cohen's d 0.48), executive functions, and working memory (both P < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.81-0.95). Among survivors, the rates of poor neurocognitive performance (>1.5 SD below control mean) for processing speed was 22%, executive functions 31%, working memory 34%, and verbal learning and memory 16%. Comparing survivors with poor versus normal neurocognitive performance, we found no difference with respect to cumulative doses of any of the cytostatic agents, age at diagnosis, or gender. CONCLUSIONS: Very long-term survivors of childhood ALL treated exclusively with chemotherapy showed no impairment in general intellectual ability, but significantly poorer performance in several neurocognitive domains than comparison peers.

Epub 2015 Aug 26.,"Chromosomal rearrangements involving the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene occur in primary and treatment-related leukemias and confer a poor prognosis. Studies based primarily on mouse models have substantially advanced our understanding of MLL leukemia pathogenesis, but often use supraphysiological oncogene expression with uncertain implications for human leukemia. Genome editing using site-specific nucleases provides a powerful new technology for gene modification to potentially model human disease, however, this approach has not been used to re-create acute leukemia in human cells of origin comparable to disease observed in patients. We applied transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated genome editing to generate endogenous MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL oncogenes through insertional mutagenesis in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from human umbilical cord blood. Engineered HSPCs displayed altered in vitro growth potentials and induced acute leukemias following transplantation in immunocompromised mice at a mean latency of 16 weeks. The leukemias displayed phenotypic and morphologic similarities with patient leukemia blasts including a subset with mixed phenotype, a distinctive feature seen in clinical disease. The leukemic blasts expressed an MLL-associated transcriptional program with elevated levels of crucial MLL target genes, displayed heightened sensitivity to DOT1L inhibition, and demonstrated increased oncogenic potential ex vivo and in secondary transplant assays. Thus, genome editing to create endogenous MLL oncogenes in primary human HSPCs faithfully models acute MLL-rearranged leukemia and provides an experimental platform for prospective studies of leukemia initiation and stem cell biology in a genetic subtype of poor prognosis leukemia.","['R01 CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA160384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 26.,"Mature B cell neoplasms cover a spectrum of diseases involving lymphoid tissues (lymphoma) or blood (leukemia), with an overlap between these two presentations. Previous studies describing equine lymphoid neoplasias have not included analyses of clonality using molecular techniques. The objective of this study was to use molecular techniques to advance the classification of B cell lymphoproliferative diseases in five adult equine patients with a rare condition of monoclonal gammopathy, B cell leukemia, and concurrent lymphadenopathy (lymphoma/leukemia). The B cell neoplasms were phenotypically characterized by gene and cell surface molecule expression, secreted immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype concentrations, Ig heavy-chain variable (IGHV) region domain sequencing, and spectratyping. All five patients had hyperglobulinemia due to IgG1 or IgG4/7 monoclonal gammopathy. Peripheral blood leukocyte immunophenotyping revealed high proportions of IgG1- or IgG4/7-positive cells and relative T cell lymphopenia. Most leukemic cells lacked the surface B cell markers CD19 and CD21. IGHG1 or IGHG4/7 gene expression was consistent with surface protein expression, and secreted isotype and Ig spectratyping revealed one dominant monoclonal peak. The mRNA expression of the B cell-associated developmental genes EBF1, PAX5, and CD19 was high compared to that of the plasma cell-associated marker CD38. Sequence analysis of the IGHV domain of leukemic cells revealed mutated Igs. In conclusion, the protein and molecular techniques used in this study identified neoplastic cells compatible with a developmental transition between B cell and plasma cell stages, and they can be used for the classification of equine B cell lymphoproliferative disease.",,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

To investigate the efficacy and mechanism of arsenic trioxide (ATO) with BTZ in inducing apoptosis of MCL cells, two MCL cell lines, along with primary cells from MCL patients (n = 4), were used. Additionally, the NOD-SCID mice xenograft model of Jeko-1 cells was established to study the anti-MCL mechanisms in an in vivo setting. ATO treatment highly improved BTZ capacity to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of MCL cells. Furthermore, the interaction of Noxa and Mcl-1 leads Bak to release from Mcl-1 or from Bcl-xl, which could further activate Bak and Bax and then induce cell apoptosis. We also found that when lower doses of BTZ were used in combination with ATO, more effective proapoptotic effects in both the cell lines and the primary cells were obtained compared to the effects of BTZ used alone at higher doses. Simultaneously, the combination of these two drugs delayed the tumor growth in mice more effectively than BTZ alone. The cooperative anti-MCL effects of this combination therapy both in vitro and in vivo strongly provided a new strategy to the clinical treatment of MCL.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Thus, the safe removal of neutrophils by apoptosis induction represents a prerequisite for the resolution of inflammation. Here, we report that intrinsic apoptosis resistance in human neutrophils, isolated from severely injured patients, is based on enhanced stabilization of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 and subsequent impairment of downstream apoptotic pathways. Whereas extrinsic apoptosis induction by the activation of Fas death receptor on inflammatory neutrophils was accompanied by caspase- and proteasome-mediated myeloid cell leukemia 1 degradation, intrinsic apoptosis induction by staurosporine led to a significant stabilization of myeloid cell leukemia 1 protein, which impeded on truncated forms of B cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein and B cell lymphoma 2 homology domain 3-interacting domain death translocation and subsequent cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. We show further that profound inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia 1 degradation is based on the inhibition of caspases and sustained activation of kinases involved in cell survival, such as Akt. Accordingly, impeded myeloid cell leukemia 1 phosphorylation on Ser159 by glycogen synthase kinase 3 and protein ubiquitination has been demonstrated. Inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia 1 activity markedly increased sensitivity to staurosporine-induced cell death. Altogether, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying myeloid cell leukemia 1-mediated apoptosis resistance to staurosporine under inflammatory situations and should be considered for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 27.,"Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is a continuing clinical problem in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A proteomic approach was used to compare profiles of the B-lineage ALL GC-sensitive cell line, PreB 697, and its GC-resistant sub-line, R3F9, pre- and post-dexamethasone exposure. PAX5, a transcription factor critical to B-cell development was differentially regulated in the PreB 697 compared to the R3F9 cell line in response to GC. PAX5 basal protein expression was less in R3F9 compared to its GC-sensitive parent and confirmed to be lower in other GC-resistant sub-lines of Pre B 697 and was associated with a decreased expression of the PAX5 transcriptional target, CD19. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that increasing GC-resistance was associated with differentiation from preB-II to an immature B-lymphocyte stage. GC-resistant sub-lines were shown to have higher levels of phosphorylated JNK compared to the parent line and JNK inhibition caused re-sensitization to GC. Exploiting this maturation may be key to overcoming GC resistance and targeting signalling pathways linked to the maturation state, such as JNK, may be a novel approach.",['MR/N00583X/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

We studied 60 patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Sixty percent of the patients were aged between 12 and 24 years. Arsenic trioxide was infused at a 0.15 mg/kg daily dose until complete remission was achieved. After 2 weeks of rest, arsenic trioxide was infused daily for 28 days as a consolidation therapy. Then, arsenic infusions were given every 3-4 months for 14 days for 2 years, and the patients were followed until relapse or death. The rates of complete remission, disease-free survival, overall survival, and drug toxicity were evaluated. The morphologic complete remission was observed in 55 out of the 60 patients. The most common causes of a remission failure were early mortality because of the APL differentiation syndrome and the lack of response to arsenic treatment. The mean follow-up was 90 months. The primary outcomes for males and females were a mean disease-free survival of 101 and 97 months, respectively, and a mean overall survival of 103 and 101 months, respectively. From the 55 cases with remission, three patients died (late mortality). Of the 60 patients, 85% are still alive. Arsenic trioxide was generally well tolerated. The long-term follow-up of patients with APL, treated with arsenic alone as induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy, shows high cure rates and excellent outcomes.

FTY720 lipid nanoparticles presented diameters around 210 nm, with an encapsulation efficiency up to 75% and significantly increased FTY720 oral bioavailability. In addition, FTY720 restores PP2A phosphatase activity and decreases phosphorylation of PP2A and its targets Akt, ERK1/2 and STAT5, all implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, FTY720 exerts an additive anti-leukemic effect in combination with drugs used in standard induction therapy. Importantly, FTY720 lipid nanoparticles were more efficient at inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis than FTY720 solution. Finally, oral administration of FTY720 lipid nanoparticles to mice every three days was as effective in reducing acute myeloid leukemia xenograft tumor growth as daily oral administration of FTY720.

We reported previously that CML cells expressing the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, accumulated a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to deregulated mitochondrial electron transport chain, which in turn led to genomic instability, resulting in imatinib resistance. In the present work, we hypothesize that imatinib-resistant cells may show higher instability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than their sensitive counterparts. To verify this hypothesis, we checked the ROS level and mtDNA damage and repair in model CML cells sensitive and resistant to imatinib and exposed to doxorubicin (DOX), a DNA-damaging agent. The extent of endogenous ROS in imatinib-resistant cells was higher than in their sensitive counterparts and DOX potentiated this relationship. ROS level in cells with primary resistance, which resulted from the T315I mutation in BCR/ABL1, was higher than in cells with acquired resistance. DOX-induced mtDNA damage in T315I imatinib-resistant cells was more pronounced than in imatinib-sensitive cells. All kinds of cells were repairing mtDNA damage with similar kinetics. In conclusion, imatinib-resistant cells can show increased instability of mtDNA, which can result from increased ROS production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in class III receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been implicated in alteration of cell signals concerning the growth and differentiation of leukemic cells. Point mutations, insertions, or deletions of RTKs as well as chromosomal translocations induce constitutive activation of the receptor, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of undifferentiated myeloid blasts. Aberrations can occur in all domains of RTKs causing either the ligand-independent activation or mimicking the activated conformation. The World Health Organization recommended including RTK mutations in the AML classification since their detection in routine laboratory diagnostics is a major factor for prognostic stratification of patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods are well-validated for the detection of fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations and can easily be applied for other RTKs. However, when methodological limitations are reached, accessory techniques can be applied. For a higher resolution and more quantitative approach compared to agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR fragments can be separated by capillary electrophoresis. Furthermore, high-resolution melting and denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography are reliable presequencing screening methods that reduce the sample amount for Sanger sequencing. Because traditional DNA sequencing is time-consuming, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an innovative modern possibility to analyze a high amount of samples simultaneously in a short period of time. At present, standardized procedures for NGS are not established, but when this barrier is resolved, it will provide a new platform for rapid and reliable laboratory diagnostic of RTK mutations in patients with AML.

An up-to-date meta-analysis was conducted to assess the prognostic value of CD11b expression level for AML patients. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched to identify studies that investigated the association between CD11b expression level and prognosis of AML patients. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI for complete remission rate (CRR) were calculated using Revman 5.3 and Stata 11.0. RESULTS: 13 total studies with 2619 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis showed that CD11b positivity was associated with lower CRR (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.79; p = 0.006) and shorter OS (HR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80; p < 0.0001), but did not affect DFS (HR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.31-1.48; p = 0.32). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity, cut-off value for CD11b positivity, treatment, subtype and sample preparation method showed no significant interaction between these factors with the prognostic value of CD11b expression level for AML patients. Sensitivity analysis yielded consistent results with the main meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: CD11b positivity could predict a poor prognosis for AML patients. Thus, CD11b expression level might be considered a prognostic biomarker for AML patients.",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to genetic aberrations, epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation are altered in cancer and impact gene expression. To identify epigenetic alterations in ALL, genome-wide methylation profiles were generated using the methylated CpG island recovery assay followed by next-generation sequencing. More than 25,000 differentially methylated regions (DMR) were observed in ALL patients with approximately 90% present within intronic or intergenic regions. To determine the regulatory potential of the DMR, whole-transcriptome analysis was performed and integrated with methylation data. Aberrant promoter methylation was associated with the altered expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and proliferation. Novel enhancer-like sequences were identified within intronic and intergenic DMR. Aberrant methylation in these regions was associated with the altered expression of neighboring genes involved in cell cycle processes, lymphocyte activation and apoptosis. These genes include potential epi-driver genes, such as SYNE1, PTPRS, PAWR, HDAC9, RGCC, MCOLN2, LYN, TRAF3, FLT1, and MELK, which may provide a selective advantage to leukemic cells. In addition, the differential expression of epigenetic modifier genes, pseudogenes, and non-coding RNAs was also observed accentuating the role of erroneous epigenetic gene regulation in ALL.","['R00 CA132784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA132784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['SRA/SRP058414'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 26.,"BACKGROUND: The long-term efficacy of a combination of chemotherapy and dasatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not well established. METHODS: Patients received dasatinib with 8 cycles of alternating hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone and high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate. Patients in complete remission (CR) continued maintenance dasatinib, vincristine, and prednisone for 2 years, which was followed by dasatinib indefinitely. Patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) received it during their first CR. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with a median age of 55 years (range, 21-80 years) were treated; 69 (96%) achieved CR. Among them, 57 (83%) achieved cytogenetic CR after 1 cycle, and 64 (93%) achieved a major molecular response at a median of 4 weeks (range, 2-38 weeks). Sixty-five patients (94%) were negative for minimal residual disease assessed by flow cytometry at a median of 3 weeks (range, 2-37 weeks). Dasatinib-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events included bleeding, pleural/pericardial effusions, and elevated transaminases. With a median follow-up of 67 months (range, 33-97 months), 33 patients (46%) were alive, and 30 (43%) were in CR; 12 underwent allogeneic SCT. Thirty-nine patients died (3 at induction, 19 after relapse, 7 after SCT performed during first CR, and 10 during CR). The median disease-free survival and overall survival were 31 (range, 0.3-97 months) and 47 months (range, 0.2-97 months), respectively. Seven relapsed patients had BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, including 4 with T315I.

RESULTS: We analyzed 135 results for 78 CML patients tested by FISH and QRT-PCR for the Ph chromosomal translocation. All newly diagnosed cases were positive by both methods. On follow-up following treatment, 1 case was FISH positive and QRT-PCR negative; 61 cases were FISH negative and QRT-PCR positive. Overall concordance was 54.1%. There was good concordance between QRT-PCR results and cytogenetic response categories.

Transforming FLT3ITD signal transduction causes formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inactivation of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) DEP-1/PTPRJ, a negative regulator of FLT3 signaling. Here we addressed the underlying mechanisms and biological consequences. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) messenger RNA and protein expression was found to be elevated in FLT3ITD-positive cells and to depend on FLT3ITD signaling and STAT5-mediated activation of the NOX4 promoter. NOX4 knockdown reduced ROS levels, restored DEP-1 PTP activity and attenuated FLT3ITD-driven transformation. Moreover, Nox4 knockout (Nox4(-/-)) murine hematopoietic progenitor cells were refractory to FLT3ITD-mediated transformation in vitro. Development of a myeloproliferative-like disease (MPD) caused by FLT3ITD-transformed 32D cells in C3H/HeJ mice, and of a leukemia-like disease in mice transplanted with MLL-AF9/ FLT3ITD-transformed murine hematopoietic stem cells were strongly attenuated by NOX4 downregulation. NOX4-targeting compounds were found to counteract proliferation of FLT3ITD-positive AML blasts and MPD development in mice. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of oncoprotein-driven PTP oxidation, and suggest that interference with FLT3ITD-STAT5-NOX4-mediated overproduction of ROS and PTP inactivation may have therapeutic potential in a subset of AML.",['RG/13/11/30384/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 4)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NOX4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRJ protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0918-9463'],,,,,,,,

The impact of rituximab on survival and patterns of treatment failure in PT-DLBCL patient remain controversial. We analyzed the clinical and biological feature of 280 PT-DLBCL cases, 64% of which were treated with rituximab-containing regimens. Although most (95%) patients achieved complete remission, a continuous risk of relapse was observed. Rituximab significantly reduced the cumulative risk of relapse (P=0.022) and improved both progression-free survival (PFS, P=0.012) and overall survival (OS, P=0.027) of PT-DLBCL patients (5-year PFS, 56% vs 36%; 5-year OS, 68% vs 48%). Central nervous system and contralateral testis were the most common sites of relapse, but other extranodal and nodal sites of relapse were also observed. Most cases of PT-DLBCL had a non-germinal center B-cell like (84%) immunophenotype and an activated B-cell like (86%) gene expression profile (GEP) subtype. The distinctive GEP signature of primary testicular lymphoma was relevant to tumor cell proliferation, dysregulated expression of adhesion molecules and immune response, likely accounting for the poor outcome. Accordingly, forkhead box P1 transcription factor (FOXP1) and T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1) oncogenic activation were confirmed and predicted a significant trend of poor survival. This study provides valuable observations for better understanding of both clinical and biological features in PT-DLBCL patients.","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA142509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RC1CA146299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA138688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (FOXP1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1100-3819'],,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 26.,"BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to assess the incidence of clinical allergy and end-induction antiasparaginase (anti-ASNase) antibodies in children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with pegylated (PEG) Escherichia coli ASNase and to determine whether they carry any prognostic significance. METHODS: Of 2057 eligible patients, 1155 were allocated to augmented arms in which PEG ASNase replaced native ASNase postinduction. Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinia) ASNase could be used to replace native ASNase after allergy, if available. Allergy and survival data were complete for 990 patients. End-induction antibody titers were available for 600 patients. RESULTS: During the consolidation phase, 289 of 990 patients (29.2%) had an allergic reaction. There were fewer allergic reactions to Erwinia ASNase than to native ASNase (odds ratio, 4.33; P < .0001) or PEG ASNase (odds ratio, 3.08; P < .0001) only during phase 1 of interim maintenance. There was no significant difference in 5-year event-free survival (EFS) between patients who received PEG ASNase throughout the entire study postinduction versus those who developed an allergic reaction to PEG ASNase during consolidation phase and subsequently received Erwinia ASNase (80.8% +/- 2.8% and 81.6% +/- 3.8%, respectively; P = .66). Patients who had positive antibody titers postinduction were more likely to have an allergic reaction to PEG ASNase (odds ratio, 2.4; P < .001). The 5-year EFS rate between patients who had negative versus positive antibody titers (80% +/- 2.6% and 77.7% +/- 4.3%, respectively; P = .68) and between patients who did not receive any ASNase postconsolidation and those who received PEG ASNase throughout the study (P = .22) were significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrate differences in the incidence rates of toxicity between ASNase preparations but not in EFS. The presence of anti-ASNase antibodies did not affect EFS.","['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98413-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,['(c) 2015 American Cancer Society.'],,,['NIHMS737620'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using Myc as a model oncogene we established a conditional mouse bone marrow transduction/transplantation model where the conditional activation of the oncoprotein Myc expressed in the hematopoietic system could be assessed for influencing the host microenvironment. Constitutive ectopic expression of Myc resulted in rapid onset of a lethal myeloproliferative disorder with a median survival of 21 days. In contrast, brief 4-day Myc activation by means of the estrogen receptor (ER) agonist tamoxifen did not result in gross changes in the percentage/frequency of hematopoietic lineages or hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cell (HSPC) subsets, nor did Myc activation significantly change the composition of the non-hematopoietic microenvironment defined by phenotyping for CD31, ALCAM, and Sca-1 expression. Transcriptome analysis of endothelial CD45- Ter119- cells from tamoxifen-treated MycER bone marrow graft recipients revealed a gene expression signature characterized by specific changes in the Rho subfamily pathway members, in the transcription-translation-machinery and in angiogenesis. In conclusion, intra-hematopoietic Myc activation results in significant transcriptome alterations that can be attributed to oncogene-induced signals from hematopoietic cells towards the microenvironment, e. g. endothelial cells, supporting the idea that even pre-leukemic HSPC highjack components of the niche which then could protect and support the cancer-initiating population.",,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluid shear stress is one of the main factors that promote embryonic hematopoiesis, however, its effects on erythroid differentiation and cytoskeleton remodeling are unclear. Erythrocyte tropomodulin of 41 kDa (E-Tmod41) caps the pointed end of actin filament (F-actin) and is critical for the formation of hexagonal topology of erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Our study focused on the regulation of E-Tmod41 and its role in F-actin cytoskeleton remodeling during erythroid differentiation induced by fluid shear stress. Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and embryonic erythroblasts were subjected to fluid shear stress (5 dyn/cm2) and erythroid differentiation was induced in both cells. F-actin content and E-Tmod41 expression were significantly increased in MEL cells after shearing. E-Tmod41 overexpression resulted in a significant increase in F-actin content, while the knockdown of E-Tmod41 generated the opposite result. An E-Tmod 3'UTR targeting miRNA, miR-23b-3p, was found suppressed by shear stress. When miR-23b-3p level was overexpressed / inhibited, both E-Tmod41 protein level and F-actin content were reduced / augmented. Furthermore, among the two alternative promoters of E-Tmod, PE0 (upstream of exon 0), which mainly drives the expression of E-Tmod41, was found activated by shear stress. In conclusion, our results suggest that fluid shear stress could induce erythroid differentiation and F-actin cytoskeleton remodeling. It upregulates E-Tmod41 expression through miR-23b-3p suppression and PE0 promoter activation, which, in turn, contributes to F-actin cytoskeleton remodeling.",,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn23b microRNA, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tropomodulin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of Msi2 silencing on treatment for AML still remains poorly understood. In this study, we used lentivirus-mediated RNA interference targeting Msi2 to investigate the resulting changes in cellular processes and the underlying mechanisms in AML cell lines as well as primary AML cells isolated from AML patients. We found that Msi2 was highly expressed in AML cells, and its depletion inhibited Ki-67 expression and resulted in decreased in vitro and in vivo proliferation. Msi2 silencing induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, with decreased Cyclin D1 and increased p21 expression. Msi2 silencing induced apoptosis through down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and up-regulation of Bax expression. Suppression of Akt, Erk1/2 and p38 phosphorylation also contributed to apoptosis mediated by Msi2 silencing. Finally, Msi2 silencing in AML cells also enhanced their chemosensitivity to daunorubicin. Conclusively, our data suggest that Msi2 is a promising target for gene therapy to optimize conventional chemotherapeutics in AML treatment.",,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MSI2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloma cell localization in the bone marrow milieu allows direct interactions between tumor cells and non-tumor bone marrow cells which promote neoplastic cell growth, survival, bone disease, acquisition of drug resistance and consequent relapse. Twenty percent of MM patients are at high-risk of treatment failure as defined by tumor markers or presentation as plasma cell leukemia. Cumulative evidences indicate a key role of Notch signaling in multiple myeloma onset and progression. Unlike other Notch-related malignancies, where the majority of patients carry gain-of-function mutations in Notch pathway members, in MM cell Notch signaling is aberrantly activated due to an increased expression of Notch receptors and ligands; notably, this also results in the activation of Notch signaling in surrounding stromal cells which contributes to myeloma cell proliferation, survival and migration, as well as to bone disease and intrinsic and acquired pharmacological resistance. Here we review the last findings on the mechanisms and the effects of Notch signaling dysregulation in MM and provide a rationale for a therapeutic strategy aiming at inhibiting Notch signaling, along with a complete overview on the currently available Notch-directed approaches.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For CLL, review of the nine RCTs showed that the main advantage of CLB is its low toxicity in comparison with purine nucleoside analogs like fludarabine in either CLL or NHL. In CLL, the major disadvantage is the very low rate of complete response, except when combining an anti-CD20 antibody. For B-cell lymphoma and WM, six RCTs were summarized.

However, the low activity of MGL blocks the anti-tumor effect. This study describes an efficient production process for the recombinant MGL (rMGL) from Idiomarina constructed using the overexpression plasmid in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), purification, and large-scale production. The enzyme produced by the transformants accounted for 53% of the total proteins and accumulated at 1.95 mg/mL using a 500 L fermentor. The enzyme was purified to approximately 99% purity using a high-pressure mechanical homogenizer and nickel (Ni) Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (FF) chromatography. Then, the enzyme was polished by gel filtration, the endotoxins were removed using diethyl-aminoethanol (DEAE) Sepharose FF, and the final product was lyophilized with a vacuum freeze dryer at -35 degrees C. The specific activity of rMGL in the lyophilized powder was up to 108 U/mg. Compared to the control, the enzyme significantly inhibited cellular proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner as tested using the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium) assay and induced cellular apoptosis as analyzed by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in leukemia cells.

Substantial evidence that AKT activity is required for telomerase activity exists, indicating that AKT inhibitors may also function as telomerase inhibitors. This possibility has not been investigated in a clinical context despite many clinical trials evaluating AKT inhibitors. We tested if Perifosine, an AKT inhibitor in clinical trials, inhibits telomerase activity and telomere maintenance in tissue culture and orthotopic xenograft models as well as in purified CLL samples from a phase II Perifosine clinical trial. We demonstrate that Perifosine inhibits telomerase activity and induces telomere shortening in a wide variety of cell lines in vitro, though there is substantial heterogeneity in long-term responses to Perifosine between cell lines. Perifosine did reduce primary breast cancer orthotopic xenograft tumor size, but did not impact metastatic burden in a statistically significant manner. However, Perifosine reduced telomerase activity in four of six CLL patients evaluated. Two of the patients were treated for four to six months and shortening of the shortest telomeres occurred in both patients' cells. These results indicate that it may be possible to repurpose Perifosine or other AKT pathway inhibitors as a novel approach to targeting telomerase.","['P50 CA070907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30 CA142543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'C06 RR30414/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA70907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 15.,"The differentiation of macrophages from monocytes is a tightly controlled and complex biological process. Although numerous studies have been conducted using biochemical approaches or global gene/protein profiling, the mechanisms of the early stages of differentiation remain unclear. Here we used SILAC-based quantitative proteomics approach to perform temporal phosphoproteome profiling of early macrophage differentiation. We identified a large set of phosphoproteins and grouped them as PMA-regulated and non-regulated phosphoproteins in the early stages of differentiation. Further analysis of the PMA-regulated phosphoproteins revealed that transcriptional suppression, cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion were among the most significantly activated pathways. Some key involved regulators of these pathways are mTOR, MYB, STAT1 and CTNNB. Moreover, we were able to classify the roles and activities of several transcriptional factors during different differentiation stages and found that E2F is likely to be an important regulator during the relatively late stages of differentiation. This study provides the first comprehensive picture of the dynamic phosphoproteome during myeloid cells differentiation, and identifies potential molecular targets in leukemic cells.",,['0 (Phosphoproteins)'],,"['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the pattern of onset and the biological characteristics of CLL in patients with coexistent Ph(-)MPN are highly heterogeneous rendering questionable if the above association reflects a causal relationship between the two disorders or merely represents a random event. By analyzing 82 patients with Ph(-)MPN and 100 age-matched healthy individuals we demonstrate that MPN patients have an almost threefold higher prevalence of, typically low-count, CLL-like monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) compared to normal adults. The clone size remained unaltered during the disease course and unaffected by the administration of hydroxycarbamide, whereas no patient with Ph(-)MPN/MBL progressed to CLL during a median follow up of 4 years. Monoclonal B cells in Ph(-)MPN/MBL patients and normal individuals and in four more patients with coexistence of overt CLL and MPN displayed heterogeneous biological characteristics, while the JAK2V617F mutation was absent in isolated lymphocytes from Ph(-)MPN patients with coexistence of CLL. Despite its clinical and biological variability, the increased incidence of MBL in Ph(-)MPN patients along with the one reported for CLL further enforces the notion of a shared pathophysiology among the two malignancies via a common genetic link and/or microenviromental interactions.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) is a major mediator of mAb cytotoxicity, but there is limited knowledge of the determinants of ADP efficacy. We used macrophages derived in vitro from autologous circulating monocytes to test the effects of mAb structure and concentration, target : effector cell ratio, duration of co-incubation and CLL cell CD20 expression on ADP. Next-generation anti-CD20 mAbs (ofatumumab, ublituximab, obinutuzumab, ocaratuzumab) were significantly more effective at inducing ADP compared to rituximab, but none were as effective as the anti-CD52 mAb alemtuzumab. Ofatumumab (10 mug/ml) used as a representative next-generation anti-CD20 mAb achieved an ADP plateau at 3 h co-incubation with a target : effector ratio of 10 : 1 (mean = 2.1 CLL cells/macrophage, range = 1.5-3.5). At 0.156 mug/ml (the lowest concentration tested) ofatumumab ADP was significantly higher than alemtuzumab. However, ofatumumab-induced ADP did not increase significantly at higher mAb concentrations. We show that anti-CD20 mAb ADP efficacy is determined by the mAb characteristics, target : effector ratio and incubation time. We suggest that preclinical evaluation of anti-CD20 mAbs to understand the determinants of ADP could be useful in designing future combination therapies for CLL.","['P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",,['(c) 2015 British Society for Immunology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes the ZO-1 and connexin 43 (Cx43) expression pattern in lymphocytes from chronic B-cell leukemia (B-CLL) patients. The ZO-1 and Cx43 expression in the B cells of 113 B-CLL patients was identified. Western blot and flow cytometry were used to determine protein expression. Results indicated that ZO-1 and Cx43 expression was reduced and correlated negatively with CD38 and Zap-70 expression. Inhibition of intercellular communication with anti-Cx43 antibodies, 1-octanol, or carbenoxolone resulted in induced cell apoptosis.

Several new mAbs have been developed and investigated in CLL over the past few years. Mainly anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies are still used routinely in CLL therapy. Unfortunately, the clinical application of mAbs needs to be further improved.

Recent epidemiological studies carried out in different European countries among peacekeepers who served in the Balkans failed to demonstrate a higher than expected risk of all cancers but, mostly due to their limitations in size and follow up time, leave open the debate on health risk of depleted uranium. The aim of SIGNUM (Study of the Genotoxic Impact in Military Units) was to identify potential genotoxic risk associated with the exposure to depleted uranium or other pollutants in the Italian Army military personnel deployed in Iraq. METHODS: Blood and urine samples were collected before and after the deployment from 981 Italian soldiers operating in Iraq in 2004-2005. As, Cd, Mo, Ni, Pb, U, V, W, and Zr were determined in urine and serum. DNA-adducts, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanine and micronuclei frequency were evaluated in blood lymphocytes. Three different genetic polymorphisms, GSTM1, XRCC1, OGG1 were analyzed. RESULTS: Significant T0-T1 reduction in the total concentration of uranium, increases for Cd, Mo, Ni, Zr, and decreases for As, Pb, W, and V in urine and plasma were observed. Increases in oxidative alterations and in micronuclei frequency, included in the range of values of non-occupationally exposed populations, were observed at the end of the period of employment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not detect any toxicologically relevant variation of DNA-damage biomarkers related to the deployment in the operational theater.",,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hazardous Substances)', '0 (Metals, Heavy)', '0 (Mutagens)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

However, most of the studies did not follow up, confirm or validate their candidates with more patient samples. Current proteomics methods, new high resolution and fast mass spectrometers allow the identification and quantification of several thousands of proteins obtained from few tens of mug of AML cell lysate. Enrichment methods for posttranslational modifications (PTM), such as phosphorylation, can isolate several thousands of site-specific phosphorylated peptides from AML patient samples, which subsequently can be quantified with high confidence in new mass spectrometers.

These bioactive agents are a diverse group of compounds which are varying in their bioactive targets, the mechanisms of action, and chemical structures. Cyanobacteria from various environments, especially marine benthic cyanobacteria, are found to be rich sources for the search for novel bioactive compounds. Several compounds with anticancer activities have been discovered from cyanobacteria and some of these have succeeded to enter the clinical trials. Varying anticancer agents are needed to overcome increasing challenges in cancer treatments. Different search methods are used to reveal anticancer compounds from natural products, but cell based methods are the most common. Cyanobacterial bioactive compounds as agents against acute myeloid leukemia are not well studied. Here we examined our new results combined with previous studies of anti-leukemic compounds from cyanobacteria with emphasis to reveal common features in strains producing such activity. We report that cyanobacteria harbor specific anti-leukemic compounds since several studied strains induced apoptosis against AML cells but were inactive against non-malignant cells like hepatocytes. We noted that particularly benthic strains from the Baltic Sea, such as Anabaena sp., were especially potential AML apoptosis inducers. Taken together, this review and re-analysis of data demonstrates the power of maintaining large culture collections for the search for novel bioactivities, and also how anti-AML activity in cyanobacteria can be revealed by relatively simple and low-cost assays.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence highlights a key role of USB1 protein in the splicing process, but nothing is known about USB1 alterations in acquired myelodysplastic syndromes, even though mutations in the spliceosome machinery represent an ubiquitous pathway in leukaemogenesis. By molecular cytogenetics and direct sequencing, we searched for USB1 deletions/duplications and point mutations in 141 bone marrow DNA samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 126), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (n = 12) and acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 3). Three unreported variants, two in USB1 5'UTR (c.-83G>T and c.-66A>G), one in IVS3 (c.450-68dupT) and one (<1%) in IVS4 (c.587+21A>G/rs200924980) were detected. The germline nature could be proved for the c.-66A>G, but remains undefined for c.-83G>T and c.450-68dupT. Matched controls analysis did not reveal either 5' UTR variants in 290 chromosomes and Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed a slight reduction in bone marrow RNA levels of the patient with c.-66A>G.

Epub 2015 Aug 26.,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, highly aggressive skin tumour. In 2008, a Merkel cell polyomavirus (MC) was identified in MCCs as a potential etiological factor of MCC. The aims of this retrospective study were to investigate the epidemiological, clinicopathological and virological features of MCCs. Between 2007 and 2012, 11 patients had been diagnosed with MCC by histological methods in University of Pecs, Hungary. In eight MCC cases MC was tested by PCR (in primary skin lesions, lymph nodes/cutan metastases, MCC neighboring carcinomas). Clinicopathological characteristics (age, histological pattern, lymphovascular invasion, co-morbidities) of MC-positive and MC-negative cases were compared. MC was detected in three (37.5%) out of eight patients' primary tumour or metastasis. The average age was 73.8 (64.3 in MC-positive group). Except the youngest, 55 year-old patient (the primary tumour appeared on his leg), all tumours were found at the head and neck region. Immunosuppression (steroid therapy, chronic lymphoid leukaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and/or old age were characteristic for all cases. Histological pattern was different in MC-positive and in MC-negative groups: MCCs with MC showed more homogeneous histological pattern, lack of lymphovascular invasion and were associated with better prognosis (mortality rate: 33% versus 80%). MCC associated with oncogenic virus is a newly recognized clinical entity. However, MC could not be detected in all histologically proven MCCs. The well-defined selection of patients/disease groups and better characterization of differences between MC-positive and negative cases is an important step towards the recognition of the etiology and pathogenesis of all MCCs.",,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system has 2 main components: an NLP-based annotator and a Semantic Web ontology-based annotation manager. We evaluated the performance of the annotator in terms of precision and recall. We demonstrated the usefulness of the system by conducting case studies in retrieving relevant clinical trials using a collection of mutations identified from TCGA Leukemia patients and Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology. In conclusion, our system using Semantic Web technologies provides an effective framework for extraction, annotation, standardization and management of genetic mutations in cancer clinical trials.",['U01 CA180940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malignant pleural effusion in hematological malignancies is rare when compared with solid tumors. We present an unusual case of myeloid sarcoma in which a mediastinal mass with pleural effusion was the initial presentation. A 27 year old gentleman presented with complaints of fever, chest pain and swelling in the anterior chest wall for 6 months. Examination revealed a lump measuring 5 x 5 cm on the left side of the chest wall. Hematological evaluation showed hemoglobin-14.2 g/dL, platelet count-233 x 10(9)/L, TLC-117 x 10(6)/L with normal differential counts. Contrast enhanced computerised tomography (CECT) confirmed the presence of a soft tissue mass in the superior mediastinum abutting against the chest wall. Core biopsy was suggestive of myeloid sarcoma and immunohistochemistry was positive for myeloperoxidase and negative for CD3, CD 20 and CD 23. Pleural fluid analysis showed the presence of malignant cells. Bone marrow examination did not show an excess of blasts. A final diagnosis of extramedullary myeloid sarcoma with malignant pleural effusion was made. The patient was given induction chemotherapy (3 + 7 regimen) with daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside. Repeat CECT done on day 28 showed complete resolution of pleural effusion and significant reduction in the size of mediastinal mass. The patient has successfully completed three cycles of consolidation therapy following which there has been complete resolution of the mass.

Discrete reports and case studies in recent years have created significant interest in the field of ""Acute leukemia with eosinophilia"". We herein present two cases of eosinophilia in association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with brief review of literature in this field. First case is about 21-year-old female who presented with mediastinal mass along with leukocytosis and hypereosinophilia. On evaluation, she was found to have T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After ruling out benign causes of eosinophilia, she was treated with modified BFM-90 protocol. Her eosinophilia resolved after 4 weeks of induction therapy. Second case is about 32-year-old male who was diagnosed as a case of mixed phenotype leukemia (B cell/myeloid type) along with severe eosinophilia. His hypereosinophilia finally resolved by week 16 of modified BFM-90 protocol. Diagnosing ALL is challenging when eosinophilia is the initial presentation. These two cases emphasize on the importance of considering ALL amongst one of the etiological causes of eosinophilia as delay in diagnosis endangers patient's life at risk. Also eosinophilia per se is an independent poor risk factor, hence prompt diagnosis and early treatment is the key in all such cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine-methotrexate or cyclosporine-mycophenolate mofetil was used. Patients were divided in 2 groups, grade II-IV aGVHD (group A) and grade 0-I aGVHD (group B). Incidence of any grade and grade II-IV aGVHD was 44 and 18 %, respectively. The most common site of aGVHD was gastro-intestinal tract (65 %) followed by skin (35 %). Higher total nucleated cell (TNC) dose infused was associated with increased incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD. Incidence of relapse and incidence of slippage of chimerism was 21 and 36 % in group A while 37 and 27 % in group B respectively. Transplant related mortality (TRM) was 21 % in group A and 13 % in group B. Probability of OS and RFS at 4 years was 63 and 34 % in group A compared with 40 and 38 % in group B, respectively. We conclude that higher TNC dose infused is a risk factor for grade II-IV aGVHD with gut being the commonest site. Grade II-IV aGVHD did not have a significant impact on incidence of relapse, TRM and OS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the miR-17-92 cluster is widely expressed in many different cell types and is essential for many developmental and pathogenic processes. As a strong oncogene, miR-17-92 can regulate multiple cellular processes that favor malignant transformation, promoting cell survival, rapid cell proliferation, and increased angiogenesis. The miR-17-92 cluster has been reported to be involved in hematopoietic malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Given the multiple and potent effects on cellular proliferation and apoptosis exerted by the miR-17-92 cluster, miRNAs belonging to the cluster surely represent attractive targets for cancer therapy also in the context of lymphoproliferative disorders.

Epub 2015 Aug 25.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common disease with highly variable clinical course. Several recurrent chromosomal alterations are associated with prognosis and may guide risk-adapted therapy. We have developed a targeted genome-wide array to provide a robust tool for ascertaining abnormalities in CLL and to overcome limitations of the 4-marker fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). DNA from 180 CLL patients were hybridized to the qChip(R)Hemo array with a high density of probes covering commonly altered loci in CLL (11q22-q23, 13q14, and 17p13), nine focal regions (2p15-p16.1, 2p24.3, 2q13, 2q36.3-q37.1, 3p21.31, 8q24.21, 9p21.3, 10q24.32, and 18q21.32-q21.33) and two larger regions (6q14.1-q22.31 and 7q31.33-q33). Overall, 86% of the cases presented copy number alterations (CNA) by array. There was a high concordance of array findings with FISH (84% sensitivity, 100% specificity); all discrepancies corresponded to subclonal alterations detected only by FISH. A chromothripsis-like pattern was detected in eight cases. Three showed concomitant shattered 5p with gain of TERT along with isochromosome 17q. Presence of 11q loss was associated with shorter time to first treatment (P = 0.003), whereas 17p loss, increased genomic complexity, and chromothripsis were associated with shorter overall survival (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.02, respectively). In conclusion, we have validated a targeted array for the diagnosis of CLL that accurately detects, in a single experiment, all relevant CNAs, genomic complexity, chromothripsis, copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity, and CNAs not covered by the FISH panel. This test may be used as a practical tool to stratify CLL patients for routine diagnostics or clinical trials.",['12-0142/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],,,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Furthermore, Btk expression is considered essential for the proliferation and survival of these cells. Btk inhibition has become an attractive strategy for treating autoimmune diseases, B-cell leukemia, and lymphomas. With the objective of proposing new candidates for Btk inhibitors, we applied receptor-dependent four-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methodology to a series of 96 nicotinamide analogs useful as Btk modulators. The QSAR models were developed using 71 compounds, the training set, and externally validated using 25 compounds, the test set. The conformations obtained by molecular dynamics simulation were overlapped in a virtual three-dimensional cubic box comprised of 2 and 5 A cells, according to the six trial alignments. The models were generated by combining genetic function approximation and partial least squares regression technique. The analyses suggest that Model 1a yields the best results. The best equation shows [Formula: see text], r(2) = .743, RMSEC = .831, RMSECV = .879. Given the importance of the Tyr551, this residue could become a strategic target for the design of novel Btk inhibitors with improved potency.

RESULTS: A significant difference between the RIF and control groups was found in the VEGF gene where the GG genotype showed a 2.1-fold increased chance of not being included in the RIF group, while the presence of an A allele increased this risk 1.6-fold. No significant differences were found for the other polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: This study showed an association between the VEGF -1154G/A polymorphism and RIF in Brazilian women.",,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (glycoprotein 130, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)']",,"['(c) 2015 S.

myeloid leukemia (AML) are imprecise, especially for those with intermediate risk AML. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether genomic approaches can provide novel prognostic information for adult patients with de novo AML. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Whole-genome or exome sequencing was performed on samples obtained at disease presentation from 71 patients with AML (mean age, 50.8 years) treated with standard induction chemotherapy at a single site starting in March 2002, with follow-up through January 2015. In addition, deep digital sequencing was performed on paired diagnosis and remission samples from 50 patients (including 32 with intermediate-risk AML), approximately 30 days after successful induction therapy. Twenty-five of the 50 were from the cohort of 71 patients, and 25 were new, additional cases. EXPOSURES: Whole-genome or exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing. Risk of identification based on genetic data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mutation patterns (including clearance of leukemia-associated variants after chemotherapy) and their association with event-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: Analysis of comprehensive genomic data from the 71 patients did not improve outcome assessment over current standard-of-care metrics. In an analysis of 50 patients with both presentation and documented remission samples, 24 (48%) had persistent leukemia-associated mutations in at least 5% of bone marrow cells at remission. The 24 with persistent mutations had significantly reduced event-free and overall survival vs the 26 who cleared all mutations. Patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk profiles had similar findings. [table: see text]. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The detection of persistent leukemia-associated mutations in at least 5% of bone marrow cells in day 30 remission samples was associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse, and reduced overall survival. These data suggest that this genomic approach may improve risk stratification for patients with AML.","['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8 HL116605/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HL087107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA166229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL116605/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG003079/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA91842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']","['JAMA. 2015 Aug 25;314(8):778-80.

Thirty-two EC tissue samples were evaluated for Fli-1 expression using immunohistochemistry. Fli-1 showed significantly high expression in EC cells, followed by hyperplasia cells, and was negative in adjacent normal tissues. The high expression of Fli-1 was significantly associated with a high differentiation grade, mutated P53 expression, and histological subtype (p < .05). Downregulation of Fli-1 in AN3CN cells using RNA interference inhibited cell clone formation and proliferation but did not affect apoptosis and migration of the cells.

Pre-existing developmental vulnerabilities (DV) may be related to long-term neuropsychological sequelae following ALL treatment, yet little is known about the prevalence or nature of prior DV in this population. PROCEDURE: Children with newly diagnosed ALL aged 2-18 years (n = 115) were screened for DV by asking parents about the child's prior developmental history and with the Developmental Profile-3 (DP-3). RESULTS: Twenty-six participants (23% of total sample) screened positive for prior DV, with one or more of the following: delayed early motor and/or language milestones that required intervention (n = 17), prior diagnosis of Down syndrome (n = 3), prior diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (n = 1), prior diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and/or learning disability (n = 6), or prior neurological conditions (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS: A sizable proportion of children with newly diagnosed ALL have pre-morbid DV that could potentially make them more vulnerable to reduced educational opportunities during treatment and neurotoxic late effects following treatment. Identification of the subset of children with ALL and DV is essential to direct early interventions and to study their long-term outcomes.",,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) the DIS3 PIN and RNB domains in purified bone marrow PCs from 164 representative patients, including 130 cases with MM, 24 with primary PC leukemia and 10 with secondary PC leukemia. DIS3 mutations were found respectively in 18.5%, 25% and 30% of cases. Identified variants were predominantly missense mutations localized in the RNB domain, and were often detected at low allele frequency. DIS3 mutations were preferentially carried by IGH-translocated/nonhyperdiploid patients. Sequential analysis at diagnosis and relapse in a subset of cases highlighted some instances of increasing DIS3 mutation burden during disease progression. NGS also revealed that the majority of DIS3 variants in mutated cases were comparably detectable at transcriptional level.

Under different experimental conditions, IL21 can either induce apoptosis or promote CLL cell survival. To investigate mechanisms involved in the effects of IL21, we studied the ability of IL21 to modulate gene and miRNA expressions in CD40-activated CLL cells. IL21 was a major regulator of chemokine production in CLL cells and it modulated the expression of genes involved in cell movement, metabolism, survival and apoptosis. In particular, IL21 down-regulated the expression of the chemokine genes CCL4, CCL3, CCL3L1, CCL17, and CCL2, while it up-regulated the Th1-related CXCL9 and CXCL10. In addition, IL21 down-regulated the expression of genes encoding signaling molecules, such as CD40, DDR1 and PIK3CD. IL21 modulated a similar set of genes in CLL and normal B-cells (e.g. chemokine genes), whereas other genes, including MYC, TNF, E2F1, EGR2 and GAS-6, were regulated only in CLL cells. An integrated analysis of the miRNome and gene expression indicated that several miRNAs were under IL21 control and these could, in turn, influence the expression of potential target genes. We focused on hsa-miR-663b predicted to down-regulate several relevant genes. Transfection of hsa-miR-663b or its specific antagonist showed that this miRNA regulated CCL17, DDR1, PIK3CD and CD40 gene expression. Our data indicated that IL21 modulates the expression of genes mediating the crosstalk between CLL cells and their microenvironment and miRNAs may take part in this process.",,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (MIRN663 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",,,,"['GEO/GSE42158', 'GEO/GSE42160']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Izmir Ataturk Education and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, from 2009 to 2013. METHODOLOGY: Cytogenetic, FISH, RQ-PCR test results from 177 CMLpatients' materials selected between 2009 - 2013 years was set up for comparison analysis. Statistical analysis was performed to compare between FISH, karyotype and RQ-PCR results of the patients. Karyotyping and FISH specificity and sensitivity rates determined by ROC analysis compared with RQ-PCR results. Chi-square test was used to compare test failure rates. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity values were determined for karyotyping 17.6 - 98% (p=0.118, p > 0.05) and for FISH 22.5 - 96% (p=0.064, p > 0.05) respectively. FISH sensitivity was slightly higher than karyotyping but there was calculated a strong correlation between them (p < 0.001). RQ-PCR test failure rate did not correlate with other two tests (p > 0.05); however, karyotyping and FISH test failure rate was statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Besides, the situation needed for karyotype analysis, RQ-PCR assay can be used alone in the follow-up of CMLdisease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using specimens from 41 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we studied the factors that might contribute to clinical response or resistance. For this purpose, thawed aliquots of primary AML samples were immunophenotypically characterized and subjected to various doses of AMG 330 in the presence or absence of healthy donor T-cells. After 48 hours, drug-specific cytotoxicity was quantified and correlated with CD33 expression levels, amounts of T-cells present, and other disease characteristics. AMG 330 caused modest cytotoxicity that was correlated with the amount of autologous T-cells (P = 0.0001) but not CD33 expression, as AMG 330 exerted marked cytotoxic effects in several specimens with minimal CD33 expression. With healthy donor T-cells added, AMG 330 cytotoxicity depended on the drug dose and effector:target (E:T) cell ratio. High cytotoxic activity was observed even with minimal CD33 expression, and AMG 330 cytotoxicity and CD33 expression correlated only at high E:T cell ratio and high AMG 330 doses (P<0.003). AMG 330 resulted in significantly higher cytotoxicity in specimens from patients with newly diagnosed AML than those with relapsed/refractory disease despite similar levels of CD33 on myeloblasts. AMG 330 cytotoxicity also appeared greater in specimens from patients with favorable-risk disease as compared to other specimens. Together, our data demonstrate that AMG 330 is highly active in primary AML specimens across the entire disease spectrum, while suggesting the presence of yet undefined, CD33-independent, relative resistance mechanisms in specific patient subsets.",['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '6Z4B5PJ4OP (AMG 330)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include histiocytic sarcomas, follicular dendritic cell sarcomas, interdigitating dendritic cell sarcomas, fibroblastic reticulum cell tumors/cytokeratin-positive interstitial cell neoplasms and neoplasms of indeterminate dendritic cells. A feature common to all of these tumors is the very difficult differential diagnosis, not least because of their rarity; however, a careful analysis will allow discrimination from other sarcomas, sarcomatoid carcinomas, lymphomas and melanomas and lead to the correct classification of the respective lesions. From the pathogenetic view point it is interesting that there is an increased association of these tumors with lymphomas and leukemias. Moreover, many cases demonstrate shared clonal antigen receptor rearrangements and/or recurrent genetic aberrations in both histologically different tumor components.

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"Autosomal recessive, complete TYK2 deficiency was previously described in a patient (P1) with intracellular bacterial and viral infections and features of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), including atopic dermatitis, high serum IgE levels, and staphylococcal abscesses. We identified seven other TYK2-deficient patients from five families and four different ethnic groups. These patients were homozygous for one of five null mutations, different from that seen in P1. They displayed mycobacterial and/or viral infections, but no HIES. All eight TYK2-deficient patients displayed impaired but not abolished cellular responses to (a) IL-12 and IFN-alpha/beta, accounting for mycobacterial and viral infections, respectively; (b) IL-23, with normal proportions of circulating IL-17(+) T cells, accounting for their apparent lack of mucocutaneous candidiasis; and (c) IL-10, with no overt clinical consequences, including a lack of inflammatory bowel disease. Cellular responses to IL-21, IL-27, IFN-gamma, IL-28/29 (IFN-lambda), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were normal. The leukocytes and fibroblasts of all seven newly identified TYK2-deficient patients, unlike those of P1, responded normally to IL-6, possibly accounting for the lack of HIES in these patients. The expression of exogenous wild-type TYK2 or the silencing of endogenous TYK2 did not rescue IL-6 hyporesponsiveness, suggesting that this phenotype was not a consequence of the TYK2 genotype. The core clinical phenotype of TYK2 deficiency is mycobacterial and/or viral infections, caused by impaired responses to IL-12 and IFN-alpha/beta. Moreover, impaired IL-6 responses and HIES do not appear to be intrinsic features of TYK2 deficiency in humans.","['UL1 TR000043/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', '5R01AI089970/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '268777/European Research Council/International', 'U01 AI088685/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 AI106942/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5U01AI088685/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5R37AI095983/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI095983/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '8UL1TR000043/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI089970/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1K99AI106942/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Interleukin-23)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)', 'Tyrosine Kinase 2 Deficiency']",,['(c) 2015 Kreins et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"The introduction of highly selective ABL-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, TKIs are only efficacious in the chronic phase of the disease and effective therapies for TKI-refractory CML, or after progression to blast crisis (BC), are lacking. Whereas the chronic phase of CML is dependent on BCR-ABL, additional mutations are required for progression to BC. However, the identity of these mutations and the pathways they affect are poorly understood, hampering our ability to identify therapeutic targets and improve outcomes. Here, we describe a novel mouse model that allows identification of mechanisms of BC progression in an unbiased and tractable manner, using transposon-based insertional mutagenesis on the background of chronic phase CML. Our BC model is the first to faithfully recapitulate the phenotype, cellular and molecular biology of human CML progression. We report a heterogeneous and unique pattern of insertions identifying known and novel candidate genes and demonstrate that these pathways drive disease progression and provide potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. Our model greatly informs the biology of CML progression and provides a potent resource for the development of candidate therapies to improve the dismal outcomes in this highly aggressive disease.","['095663/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '13031/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '14-1069/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'MR/M010392/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor C, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",['J Exp Med. 2015 Sep 21;212(10):1482.

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the fourth most common malignancy in children, has an even higher incidence in adolescents, and is primarily represented by only a few histologic subtypes. Dramatic progress has been achieved, with survival rates exceeding 80%, in large part because of a better understanding of the biology of the different subtypes and national and international collaborations. Most patients with Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are cured with short intensive pulse chemotherapy containing cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and high-dose methotrexate. The benefit of the addition of rituximab has not been established except in the case of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is treated with intensive, semi-continuous, longer leukemia-derived protocols. Relapses in B-cell and lymphoblastic lymphomas are rare and infrequently curable, even with intensive approaches. Event-free survival rates of approximately 75% have been achieved in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas with various regimens that generally include a short intensive B-like regimen. Immunity seems to play an important role in prognosis and needs further exploration to determine its therapeutic application. ALK inhibitor therapeutic approaches are currently under investigation. For all pediatric lymphomas, the intensity of induction/consolidation therapy correlates with acute toxicities, but because of low cumulative doses of anthracyclines and alkylating agents, minimal or no long-term toxicity is expected. Challenges that remain include defining the value of prognostic factors, such as early response on positron emission tomography/computed tomography and minimal disseminated and residual disease, using new biologic technologies to improve risk stratification, and developing innovative therapies, both in the first-line setting and for relapse.",,,,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"Diagnosis, treatment, response monitoring, and outcome of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have made enormous progress during the past decades. Because AML is a rare type of childhood cancer, with an incidence of approximately seven occurrences per 1 million children annually, national and international collaborative efforts have evolved. This overview describes these efforts and includes a summary of the history and contributions of each of the main collaborative pediatric AML groups worldwide. The focus is on translational and clinical research, which includes past, current, and future clinical trials. Separate sections concern acute promyelocytic leukemia, myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome, and relapsed AML. A plethora of novel antileukemic agents that have emerged, including new classes of drugs, are summarized as well. Finally, an important aspect of the treatment of pediatric AML--supportive care--and late effects are discussed. The future is bright, with a wide range of emerging innovative therapies and with more and more international collaboration that ultimately aim to cure all children with AML, with fewer adverse effects and without late effects.","['U10-CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive sarcoma of bone and soft tissue occurring at any age with a peak incidence in adolescents and young adults. The treatment of ES relies on a multidisciplinary approach, coupling risk-adapted intensive neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapies with surgery and/or radiotherapy for control of the primary site and possible metastatic disease. The optimization of ES multimodality therapeutic strategies has resulted from the efforts of several national and international groups in Europe and North America and from cooperation between pediatric and medical oncologists. Successive first-line trials addressed the efficacy of various cyclic combinations of drugs incorporating doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, etoposide, and dactinomycin and identified prognostic factors now used to tailor therapies. The role of high-dose chemotherapy is still debated. Current 5-year overall survival for patients with localized disease is 65% to 75%. Patients with metastases have a 5-year overall survival < 30%, except for those with isolated pulmonary metastasis (approximately 50%). Patients with recurrence have a dismal prognosis. The many insights into the biology of the EWS-FLI1 protein in the initiation and progression of ES remain to be translated into novel therapeutic strategies. Current options and future approaches will be discussed.",,,,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"PURPOSE: Lenalidomide and rituximab (LR) are active agents in follicular lymphoma (FL). Combination regimens have not been previously assessed in randomized studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance) 50401 trial is a randomized phase II trial studying rituximab (375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks), lenalidomide (15 mg per day on days 1 to 21, followed by 7 days of rest, in cycle 1 and then 20 mg per day on days 1 to 21, followed by 7 days of rest, in cycles 2 to 12), or LR. The rituximab-alone arm was discontinued as a result of poor accrual. Eligibility included recurrent FL and prior rituximab with time to progression of >/= 6 months from last dose. Aspirin or heparin was recommended for patients at high thrombosis risk. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (lenalidomide, n = 45; LR, n = 46) received treatment; median age was 63 years (range, 34 to 89 years), and 58% were intermediate or high risk according to the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. In the lenalidomide and LR arms, grade 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 58% and 53% of patients, with 9% and 11% of patients experiencing grade 4 toxicity, respectively; grade 3 to 4 adverse events included neutropenia (16% v 20%, respectively), fatigue (9% v 13%, respectively), and thrombosis (16% [n = 7] v 4% [n = 2], respectively; P = .157). Thirty-six percent of lenalidomide patients and 63% of LR patients completed 12 cycles. Lenalidomide alone was associated with more treatment failures, with 22% of patients discontinuing treatment as a result of adverse events. Dose-intensity exceeded 80% in both arms. Overall response rate was 53% (20% complete response) and 76% (39% complete response) for lenalidomide alone and LR, respectively (P = .029). At the median follow-up of 2.5 years, median time to progression was 1.1 year for lenalidomide alone and 2 years for LR (P = .0023). CONCLUSION: LR is more active than lenalidomide alone in recurrent FL with similar toxicity, warranting further study in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as a platform for addition of novel agents.","['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00238238'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"PURPOSE: Secondary and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (sAML and tAML, respectively) remain therapeutic challenges. Still, it is unclear whether their inferior outcome compared with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) varies as a result of previous hematologic disease or can be explained by differences in karyotype and/or age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a Danish national population-based study of 3,055 unselected patients with AML diagnosed from 2000 to 2013, we compared the frequencies and characteristics of tAML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) -sAML, and non-MDS-sAML (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasia) versus de novo AML. Limited to intensive therapy patients, we compared chance of complete remission by logistic regression analysis and used a pseudo-value approach to compare relative risk (RR) of death at 90 days, 1 year, and 3 years, overall and stratified by age and karyotype. Results were given crude and adjusted with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Overall, frequencies of sAML and tAML were 19.8% and 6.6%, respectively. sAML, but not tAML, was associated with low likelihood of receiving intensive treatment. Among intensive therapy patients (n = 1,567), antecedent myeloid disorder or prior cytotoxic exposure was associated with decreased complete remission rates and inferior survival (3-year adjusted RR for MDS-sAML, non-MDS-sAML, and tAML: RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.32; RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.34; and RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.32, respectively) compared with de novo AML. Among patients >/= 60 years old and patients with adverse karyotype, previous MDS or tAML did not impact overall outcomes, whereas non-MDS-sAML was associated with inferior survival across age and cytogenetic risk groups (adverse risk cytogenetics: 1-year adjusted RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.76; patients >/= 60 years old: 1-year adjusted RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.61). CONCLUSION: Our results support that de novo AML, sAML, and tAML are biologically and prognostically distinct subtypes of AML. Patients with non-MDS-sAML have dismal outcomes, independent of age and cytogenetics. Previous myeloid disorder, age, and cytogenetics are crucial determinants of outcomes and should be integrated in treatment recommendations for these patients.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"PURPOSE: To review the impact of collaborative studies on advances in the biology and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adolescents. METHODS: A review of English literature on childhood ALL focusing on collaborative studies was performed. The resulting article was reviewed and revised by the committee chairs of the major ALL study groups. RESULTS: With long-term survival rates for ALL approaching 90% and the advent of high-resolution genome-wide analyses, several international study groups or consortia were established to conduct collaborative research to further improve outcome. As a result, treatment strategies have been improved for several subtypes of ALL, such as infant, MLL-rearranged, Philadelphia chromosome-positive, and Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL. Many recurrent genetic abnormalities that respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and multiple genetic determinants of drug resistance and toxicities have been identified to help develop targeted therapy. Several genetic polymorphisms have been recognized that show susceptibility to developing ALL and that help explain the racial/ethnic differences in the incidence of ALL. CONCLUSION: The information gained from collaborative studies has helped decipher the heterogeneity of ALL to help improve personalized treatment, which will further advance the current high cure rate and the quality of life for children and adolescents with ALL.","['U01 GM92666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Outcomes of 86 adult patients with B-ALL who received auto-HSCT in our center from January 1996 to February 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS)and disease free survival (DFS)at 5 years for the cohort were (63.8 +/- 5.6)% and (60.9 +/- 5.6)%, respectively. The cumulative non-relapse mortality (NRM)and relapse at 5 years were (4.70 +/- 0.05)% and (34.40 +/- 0.31)%. For DFS, age >/= 35 years, high lactate dehydrogenase at diagnosis, high initial WBC count, blast cell proportion >/= 5% on 15th day of the first induction therapy, complete remession (CR)1 to HSCT interval >6 months and CD34(+) cells in graft >/= 3.8 x 10(6)/kg were the poor prognostic factors. CR1 to HSCT interval >6 months was the independently undesirable factors in COX regression model. For 34 patients who had results of minimal residual disease (MRD), positive pretransplantation MRD (MRD>/=0.01%), positive post-induction MRD or MRD positive again during the chemotherapy indicated poor prognosis, and the last one was the independent adverse prognostic factor.

METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot methods were used to detect the expression of Rap1GAP in Venus/HL-60 (vehicle control) and Rap1GAP/HL-60 cells (R1 andR2). Transwell method was used to examine the invasion ability in vitro. Quantitative RT-PCR and gelatin zymograph were used to study the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Four-week-old BALB/c nu/nu mice were pre-treated and inoculated with leukemic cells from different groups, several index including survival time were then monitored. RESULTS: Rap1GAP mRNA level of R1 and R2 increased about 16-17 folds as compared to the control cells. The invasion rate of R1 and R2 are (55 +/- 5)% and (59 +/- 4)%, which are significantly higher than (14 +/- 4)% of the control cells. The mRNA level of MMP-9 was up-regulated about 12.0 folds in R1 and R2 cells compared to the corresponding control cells. The median survival times of R1 and R2 mice are (32.00 +/- 1.85) d and (33.37 +/- 2.50) d, respectively, which are shorter than (43.62 +/- 2.32) d of the control group. Three mice of R1 and R2 groups showed leukemic cells infiltration in meninges tissue, and the genes of Rap1GAP and MMP-9 were amplified by PCR method. CONCLUSION: Up-regulated expression of Rap1GAP increased the invasion ability of HL-60 cells accompanied with enhancement of MMP-9 expression in vitro, and the experiment in mouse model also confirmed that Rap1GAP enhanced the invasion of HL-60 cells in vivo.",,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (RAP1GAP protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Purified leukemia cells from 14 common B-ALL adult patients (4 Ph(+) and 10 Ph(-) cases) were obtained by flow cytometry sorting, and maintained in a mimic bone marrow microenvironment culture system for short-term culture. Leukemia cells were treated with various concentrations of GSK525762A. The inhibitory effects of BRD4 inhibitor on common B-ALL leukemia cells were measured by CCK-8 assay and the apoptosis of those cells was determined by Annexin/7-AAD staining using flow cytometry. The transcripts of c-MYC, CDK6 and Bcl-2 were detected by quantitative RT-PCR, and the expression of c-MYC, CDK6 and Bcl-2 proteins were detected via Western blot. RESULTS: GSK525762A could inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells from all 14 common B-ALL patients in a dose-dependent manner, the median value of IC50 was 256.25 (90.64-1 378.39)nmol/L. GSK525762A could promote cells apoptosis of B-ALL leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner, the median apoptosis rates respectively were 45.17%(9.38%-70.91%), 66.02% (24.36%-96.34%) and 89.29% (39.29%-99.37%) after treated by 500, 1 000 and 2 500 nmol/L GSK525762A. GSK525762A has a similar effect on Ph(+) ALL and Ph(-) B-ALL, but the effect of proliferation inhibition and apoptosis enhancement on Ph+ B-ALL is weaker than that on Ph(-) B-ALL. Compared with vehicle control group, the levels of c-MYC, Bcl-2 and CDK6 transcripts in leukemic cells were reduced after treatment for 24 h and 48 h by 1 000 nmol/L GSK525762A, and there are no significant differences in the downregulation of c-MYC and CDK6 mRNA between Ph(+) and Ph(-) B-ALL; however, the inhibitory effect on Bcl-2 transcription was weaker in Ph(+) B-ALL cells than that in Ph(-) B-ALL cells. Moreover, c-MYC, Bcl-2 and CDK6 protein levels decreased in GSK525762A treated group. CONCLUSION: GSK525762A could strongly inhibit the proliferation of common B-ALL and trigger apoptosis; meanwhile it has certain effects against Ph(+) ALL in vitro.

This study aimed to investigate the temporal trend of eight major cancers in Xuanwei County using data from three mortality surveys (1973-1975, 1990-1992, and 2004-2005). The Chinese population in 1990 was used as a standard population to calculate agestandardized mortality rates. Cancers of lung, liver, breast, brain, esophagus, leukemia, rectum, and stomach were identified as the leading cancers in this county in terms of mortality rate. During the three time periods, lung cancer remained as the most common type of cancer. The mortality rates for all other types of cancer were lower than those of the national average, but an increasing trend was observed for all the cancers, particularly from 1990-1992 to 2004-2005. The temporal trend could be partly explained by changes in risk factors, but it also may be due to the improvement in cancer diagnosis and screening. Further epidemiological studies are warranted to systematically examine the underlying reasons for the temporal trend of the major cancers in Xuanwei County.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using cDNA microarrays, we verified B cell leukemia/lymphoma 3 (Bcl3) as the most significantly downregulated factor following LIF withdrawal in mESCs. Bcl3 knockdown altered mESC morphology, reduced expression of pluripotency genes including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, and downregulated DNA binding of acetylated histone 3 and RNA polymerase II on the Oct4 promoter. Conversely, Bcl3 overexpression partially prevented cell differentiation and promoted Oct4 and Nanog promoter activities. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Bcl3 regulation of mESC pluripotency may be through its association with Oct4 and beta-catenin and its promoter binding capability. These results establish that Bcl3 positively regulates pluripotency genes and thus shed light on the mechanism of Bcl3 as a downstream molecule of LIF/STAT3 signaling in pluripotency maintenance.",,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,['(c) 2015 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the clinical and biological features governing the clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been most extensively studied. Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) allows tumor cells to escape from the antitumor effect of the immune system. Recent studies have shown that various tumor cells show an increased HLA-G expression. Data regarding HLA-G expression in CLL are limited and controversial. The aim of this work is to evaluate flow cytometry study of HLA-G expression on cell surface and assess its relationship with other prognostic factors (CD38, ZAP70, beta 2 microglobulin [beta2MG]) in patients with CLL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-five newly diagnosed CLL cases. White blood cell count, lymphocyte absolute count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, and serum beta2MG level were studied at admission. In each patient, morphologic diagnosis of B-CLL was confirmed by flow cytometry HLA-G, CD38 and ZAP70 expression levels were measured with four-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: HLA-G positivity ranged between 1% and 12% in CLL patients. A significant correlation was found with CD38, ZAP70, disease stage, and beta2MG (P < 0.001). The off-treatment follow-up period was longer in the HLA-G negative group (P < 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we suggest that, in addition to other prognostic factors, surface HLA-G expression can be considered as an independent prognostic factor. However, our work should be confirmed by further prospective studies, a longer off-treatment follow-up period, and a standardized method.",,"['0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jun 6.,"The aim of this study was to synthesize highly biocompatible and functionalized silver nanoparticles using endophytic fungi isolated from the leaves of medicinal plants. Among 13 fungi tested, the isolate, Guignardia mangiferae (Bios PTK 4) extracellularly synthesized well-dispersed and extremely stable silver nanoparticles under optimized reaction conditions within 12 h. These nanoparticles were characterized by HR-TEM, SAED, XRD and EDX analyses. G. mangiferae synthesized 5-30 nm sized, spherical shaped silver nanoparticles. Effect of pH on the antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles was studied using well diffusion assay; on the basis of particle stability and antibacterial activity, pH 7 was found to be optimum. The leakage of intracellular components has clearly demonstrated that silver nanoparticles damage the bacterial cells by formation of pores, which affect the membrane permeability and finally leads to cell death. In addition, silver nanoparticles exhibited excellent antifungal activity against plant pathogenic fungi. Cytotoxic effects of silver nanoparticles showed IC50 values of 63.37, 27.54 and 23.84 mug/mL against normal African monkey kidney (Vero), HeLa (cervical) and MCF-7 (breast) cells, respectively, at 24 h incubation period. Thus, the obtained results convincingly suggest that silver nanoparticles synthesized from G. mangiferae are highly biocompatible and have wider applicability and they could be explored as promising candidates for a variety of biomedical/pharmaceutical and agricultural applications.",,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

In the effort to find new anti-leukemic agents, we evaluated the small drug SB225002 (N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N'-(2-bromophenyl)urea). Although initially described as a selective antagonist of CXCR2, later studies have identified other cellular targets for SB225002, with potential medicinal use in cancer. We found that SB225002 has a significant pro-apoptotic effect against both B- and T-ALL cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that treatment with SB225002 induces G2-M cell cycle arrest. Transcriptional profiling revealed that SB225002-mediated apoptosis triggered a transcriptional program typical of tubulin binding agents. Network analysis revealed the activation of genes linked to the JUN and p53 pathways and inhibition of genes linked to the TNF pathway. Early cellular effects activated by SB225002 included the up-regulation of GLIPR1, a p53-target gene shown to have pro-apoptotic activities in prostate and bladder cancer. Silencing of GLIPR1 in B- and T-ALL cell lines resulted in increased resistance to SB225002. Although SB225002 promoted ROS increase in ALL cells, antioxidant N-Acetyl Cysteine pre-treatment only modestly attenuated cell death, implying that the pro-apoptotic effects of SB225002 are not exclusively mediated by ROS. Moreover, GLIPR1 silencing resulted in increased ROS levels both in untreated and SB225002-treated cells. In conclusion, SB225002 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in different B- and T-ALL cell lines. Inhibition of tubulin function with concurrent activation of the p53 pathway, in particular, its downstream target GLIPR1, seems to underlie the anti-leukemic effect of SB225002.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GLIPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SB 225002)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we engineered mice that conditionally express the E2A-PBX1 fusion oncogene, which results from chromosomal translocation t(1;19) and is present in 5% to 7% of pediatric ALL cases. The incidence of leukemia in these mice varied from 5% to 50%, dependent on the Cre-driving promoter (Cd19, Mb1, or Mx1) used to induce E2A-PBX1 expression. Two distinct but highly similar subtypes of B cell precursor ALLs that differed by their pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) status were induced and displayed maturation arrest at the pro-B/large pre-B II stages of differentiation, similar to human E2A-PBX1 ALL. Somatic activation of E2A-PBX1 in B cell progenitors enhanced self-renewal and led to acquisition of multiple secondary genomic aberrations, including prominent spontaneous loss of Pax5. In preleukemic mice, conditional Pax5 deletion cooperated with E2A-PBX1 to expand progenitor B cell subpopulations, increasing penetrance and shortening leukemia latency. Recurrent secondary activating mutations were detected in key signaling pathways, most notably JAK/STAT, that leukemia cells require for proliferation. These data support conditional E2A-PBX1 mice as a model of human ALL and suggest targeting pre-BCR signaling and JAK kinases as potential therapeutic strategies.",['UL1 TR001085/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malnutrition can often be a consequence of cancer itself or a result of chemotherapy. Nutritional support aims to reverse malnutrition seen at diagnosis, prevent malnutrition associated with treatment and promote weight gain and growth. The most effective and safe forms of nutritional support in children and young people with cancer are not known. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of any form of parenteral (PN) or enteral (EN) nutritional support, excluding vitamin supplementation and micronutrient supplementation, in children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and to determine the effect of the nutritional content of PN and EN. This is an update of a previous Cochrane review. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases for the initial review: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CINAHL (1982 to 2006), the National Research Register (2007) and Dissertations & Theses (2007). Experts in the field were also contacted for information on relevant trials. For this update, we searched the same electronic databases from 2006 to September 2013. We also scrutinised the reference lists of included articles to identify additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any form of nutritional support with another, or control, in children or young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials. At least two authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted trialists for missing information. MAIN RESULTS: The current review included the eight trials from the initial review and six new trials which randomised 595 participants (< 21 years of age) with leukaemias or solid tumours undergoing chemotherapy. The trials were all of low quality with the exception of two of the trials looking at glutamine supplementation. One small trial found that compared to EN, PN significantly increased weight (mean difference (MD) 4.12, 95% CI 1.91 to 6.33), serum albumin levels (MD 0.70, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.26), calorie intake (MD 22.00, 95% CI 5.12 to 38.88) and protein intake (MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.15). One trial comparing peripheral PN and EN with central PN found that mean daily weight gain (MD -27.00, 95% CI -43.32 to -10.68) and energy intake (MD -15.00, 95% CI -26.81 to -3.19) were significantly less for the peripheral PN and EN group, whereas mean change in serum albumin was significantly greater for that group (MD 0.47, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81, P = 0.008). Another trial with few participants found an increase in mean energy intake (% recommended daily amount) in children fed an energy dense feed compared to a standard calorie feed (MD +28%, 95% CI 17% to 39%). Three studies looked at glutamine supplementation. The evidence suggesting that glutamine reduces severity of mucositis was not statistically significant in two studies (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.2 and RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.1) and differences in reduction of infection rates were also not significant in two studies (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.4 and RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51). Only one study compared olive oil based PN to standard lipid containing PN. Despite similar calorie contents in both feeds, the standard lipid formula lead to greater weight gain (MD -0.34 z-scores, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.00). A single study compared standard EN with fructooligosaccharide containing EN. There was no difference in weight gain between groups (mean difference -0.12, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.33), with adverse effects (nausea) occurring equally between the groups (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.74). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence from individual trials to suggest that PN is more effective than EN in well-nourished children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The evidence for other methods of nutritional support remains unclear. Limited evidence suggests an energy dense feed increases mean daily energy intake and has a positive effect on weight gain. Evidence suggesting glutamine supplementation reduces incidence and severity of mucositis, infection rates and length of hospital stay is not statistically significant. Further research, incorporating larger sample sizes and rigorous methodology utilising valid and reliable outcome measures, is essential.","['G0800472/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'PDF-2014-07-072/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010;(7):CD003298.

Despite significant advances in therapy over the last decade CLL remains incurable. Current front-line therapy often consists of chemoimmunotherapy-based regimens, most commonly the fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus rituximab combination, but rates of relapse and refractory disease are high among these patients. Several key signaling pathways are now known to mediate the survival and proliferation of CLL cells in vivo, the most notable of which are the pathways mediated by the B-cell receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptors. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, the underlying biology of the CLL-cell and the roles of the tumour microenvironment has provided the rationale for trials of a range of novel, more targeted therapeutic agents. In particular, clinical trials of ibrutinib and idelalisib, which target the Brutons tyrosine kinase and the delta isoform of phosphoinositol-3 kinase components of the BCR signaling pathway respectively, have shown extremely promising results. Here we review the current literature on the key signaling pathways and interactions of CLL cells that mediate the survival and proliferation of the leukemic cells. For each we describe the results of the recent clinical trials and in vitro studies of novel therapeutic agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, HTLV-1 may be related to thalassemia and hemophilia cases after blood transfusion. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was evaluation of the prevalence of HTLVs in patients with hematological disorders (leukemia, thalassemia, lymphoma and hemophilia). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during April to October 2012. A total of 101 serum samples were collected from patients and were stored at -20 masculineC. DNA was extracted from serum by an extraction kit. The extracted DNA was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of HTLV-Iota and HTLV-II pol and tax gene sequences, respectively. Samples were collected from 67 (66.33%), 20 (19.80%), 4 (3.96%), and 10 (9.90%) patients with thalassemia, leukemia, lymphoma and hemophilia, respectively. RESULTS: One thalassemia sample was HTLV-Iota positive, but none of the samples contained the genome of HTLV-II. The prevalence of HTLV-Iota in this study in patients with hematological disorders was 0.99%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HTLV-Iota in hematological disorders was similar to that of other parts of Iran. The present study revealed that HTLV-Iota screening should be performed before blood transfusion to reduce the risk of virus transmission in patients with hematological disorders. More study should be performed to detect these viruses in blood donors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, double inv(3)(q21q26.2) is extremely rare in AML. We report here 3 cases analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Clinicopathologic, cytogenetic and molecular findings were correlated with clinical outcome to better understand the entity. RESULTS: The study group included one man and two women at 56-74 years of age. The AML arose from myelodysplastic syndrome in one patient and from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in another patient. Monosomy 7 was found as additional cytogenetic finding in one patient. One patient had a single inv(3) in the initial clone and acquired double inv(3) as part of clonal evolution. EVI1 (MECOM) rearrangement was confirmed using metaphase/interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Microarray (aCGH + SNP) data analysis revealed that the double inv(3) was a result of acquiring copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3q: arr[hg19] 3q13.21q29(10,344,387-197,802,470)x2 hmz, spanning ~ 94.3 Mb in size. Mutational profiling showed a PTPN11 mutation at a low level (~10 %) in one patient and wild type FLT3 and RAS in all patients. No patients achieved cytogenetic remission and all died with an overall survival (OS) of 23, 12 and 5 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Double inv(3) is a result of acquired copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, a somatic repair event occurring as a part of mitotic recombination of the partial chromosome 3q. The double inv(3) in AML patients is highly associated with a rapid disease progression.",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal residual disease (mrd) is a useful tool for predicting leukemia relapse. However, there is no consensus on how to treat children with elevation of BCR-ABL transcripts but no evidence of hematologic relapse during chemotherapy combined with imatinib. Here, we report the case of a child with Ph+ all who had persistent elevation of mrd, but no evidence of hematologic relapse while receiving imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy. Dasatinib was substituted for imatinib because no suitable donor for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (hsct) was available. Less-intensive chemotherapy with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine was administered concomitantly. No serious adverse events were encountered. With continuous dasatinib combined with chemotherapy, but no allogeneic hsct, our patient reached complete molecular remission and has been in complete molecular remission for more than 13 months. This report is the first about the long-term use of dasatinib in patients with Ph+ all and mrd elevation but hematologic remission during imatinib chemotherapy. In a similar situation, chemotherapy combined with dasatinib instead of allogeneic hsct could be considered to avoid hsct-related mortality and morbidity.

Bendamustine is used as monotherapy or in combination with other agents to treat patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll). METHODS: The prospective interventional open-label bend-act trial evaluated bendamustine in patients with rituximab-refractory indolent nhl (inhl) and previously untreated cll. Study objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of bendamustine monotherapy and to provide patients with access to bendamustine before Health Canada approval. The study aimed to enrol up to 100 patients. All patients with inhl received an intravenous dose of bendamustine 120 mg/m(2) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21- or 28-day treatment cycles. All patients with cll received an intravenous dose of bendamustine 100 mg/m(2) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2 for up to six 28-day treatment cycles. RESULTS: Of 90 patients treated on study (16 with cll and 74 with inhl), 35 completed the study (4 with cll and 31 with inhl). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes) were nausea (70%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), and diarrhea (33%)-mostly grades 1 and 2. Ondansetron was the most common supportive medication used in the patients (63.5% of those with inhl and 68.8% of those with cll). Neutropenia (32%), anemia (23%), and thrombocytopenia (21%) were the most frequent hematologic teaes, with neutropenia being the most common grade 3 or 4 teae leading to dose modification. Dose delays occurred in 28 patients (31.3%) because of grade 3 or 4 teaes, with a higher incidence of dose delays being observed in inhl patients on the 21-day treatment cycle than in those on the 28-day treatment cycle (50.0% vs. 24.1%). During the study, 33 patients (36.7%) experienced at least 1 serious adverse event, and 4 deaths were reported (all in patients with inhl). CONCLUSIONS: The type and frequency of the teaes reported accorded with observations in earlier clinical trials and post-marketing experiences, thus confirming the acceptable and manageable safety profile of bendamustine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the impact of 12 genetic variants of the two genes, CYP3A4/A5 and the human cation transporter 1 gene (hOCT1) on the clinical outcome, in a cohort of 106 newly diagnosed CML patients. In the patient cohort investigated, only 6 variant alleles could be detected. The others were not present and could not be investigated. Two polymorphisms, CYP3A5*3 (rs776746)and hOCT1 M408V (rs628031), were significantly associated with the Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) at 6 months and Major Molecular Response (MMR) at 12 months.

A number of inhibitors are in clinical development, and two have already reached the market. Unfortunately, all of them are burdened with different toxicity profiles. To check if the JAK inhibitors of different selectivity evoke different responses on JAK2-dependent and independent cells, we have used three acute myeloid leukemia cell lines with confirmed JAK2 mutation status. We have found that JAK inhibitors exert distinct effect on the expression of BCLXL, CCND1 and c-MYC genes, regulated by JAK pathway, in JAK2 wild type cells in comparison to JAK2 V617F-positive cell lines. Moreover, cell cycle analysis showed that inhibitors alter the cycle by arresting cells in different phases. Our results suggest that observed effect of JAK2 inhibitors on transcription and cell cycle level in different cell lines are associated not with activity within JAK family, but presumably with other off-target activities.",,"['0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (LY2784544)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '6L1XP550I6 (Fedratinib)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', '87LA6FU830 (tofacitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2015 Aug 25.,"UNLABELLED: Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in tumor immunotherapy with their unique capability of killing transformed cells without the need for prior sensitization and without major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/peptide restriction. However, tumor cells can escape NK cell cytotoxicity by various tumor immune escape mechanisms. To overcome these escape mechanisms, NK cells can be modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), enhancing their tumor-specific cytotoxicity. To determine the most efficacious method to modify human NK cells, we compared different retroviral vector systems, retroviral pseudotypes, and transduction protocols. Using optimized transduction conditions, the highest transduction levels (up to 60%) were achieved with alpharetroviral vectors. Alpharetroviral-modified primary human NK cells exhibited no alteration in receptor expression and had similar degranulation activity as untransduced NK cells, thus demonstrating that alpharetroviral modification did not negatively affect NK cell cytotoxicity. Transduction of NK cells with an alpharetroviral vector containing a CD19 CAR expression cassette selectively enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity towards CD19-expressing leukemia cells, achieving nearly complete elimination of leukemia cells after 48 h. Taken together, alpharetroviral vectors are promising tools for NK cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy applications. KEY MESSAGES: Efficient modification of human NK cells using alpharetroviral vectors. Anti-CD19-CAR-NK cells exhibited improved cytotoxicity towards CD19(+) leukemia cells. Alpharetroviral vectors are promising tools for immunotherapy applications using NK cells.",,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Apr 1.,"BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia is common during treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Several risk factors have been proposed, but emergence of new evidence suggests conflicting results. In view of ethnic differences in the propensity for diabetes, this study aims to delineate the characteristics of pediatric patients at risk for hyperglycemia during chemotherapy in Taiwan. METHODS: This retrospective study involved chart review of consecutive patients younger than 18 years with diagnosis of ALL in a medical center in Taiwan from 1997 to 2008. Hyperglycemia was defined by random plasma glucose levels >/=200 mg/dL or fasting glucose levels >/=126 mg/dL in at least two separate samplings. Risk factors for hyperglycemia were described with crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in the univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 133 patients were included for analysis. Overall, 22 patients (16.5%) experienced hyperglycemia during ALL treatment. Most hyperglycemic episodes occurred within the first 8 days after prednisolone use. Age older than 10 years was the most important predictor of hyperglycemia (adjusted OR = 10.88, 95% CI 2.40-49.37). Patients with fasting glucose concentration >/=100 mg/dL were also 5.7-fold (95% CI 1.63-19.93) more likely to develop hyperglycemia, whereas the predictive significance of obesity was attenuated after adjustment. CONCLUSION: Assessment of glucose concentration should be vigilant in the 1(st) week after prednisolone use during ALL treatment. Clinicians should be alert to the patient at risk of hyperglycemia, particularly obese adolescents with disarranged glucose homeostasis.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['Copyright (c) 2015.

OIS is frequently accompanied by multinucleation; however, the origin of this is unknown. Here, we show that multinucleate OIS cells originate mostly from failed mitosis. Prior to senescence, mutant H-RasV12 activation in primary human fibroblasts compromised mitosis, concordant with abnormal expression of mitotic genes functionally linked to the observed mitotic spindle and chromatin defects. Simultaneously, H-RasV12 activation enhanced survival of cells with damaged mitoses, culminating in extended mitotic arrest and aberrant exit from mitosis via mitotic slippage. ERK-dependent transcriptional upregulation of Mcl1 was, at least in part, responsible for enhanced survival and slippage of cells with mitotic defects. Importantly, mitotic slippage and oncogene signaling cooperatively induced senescence and key senescence effectors p21 and p16.

Epub 2015 Sep 10.,"AML with FLT3 ITD mutations are associated with poor outcome. We reviewed outcomes of patients with FLT3 ITD mutated AML to investigate trends over time. We analyzed 224 AML patients (excluding patients with core binding factor and acute promyelocytic leukemia) referred to our institution between 2000 and 2014. Patients were divided into five cohorts by era: 2000-2002 (Era 1, n = 19), 2003-2005 (Era 2, n = 41), 2006-2008 (Era 3, n = 53), 2009-2011 (Era 4, n = 55), and 2012-2014 (Era 5, n = 56) to analyze differences in outcome. The baseline characteristics were not statistically different across Eras. The response rate (CR/CRp) from Era 1-5 was 68%, 49%, 72%, 73%, and 75%, respectively. The overall response rate (all Eras) with chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus FLT3 inhibitor was 67% and 72.5%, respectively (P = 0.4). The median time to relapse was 6, 3.6, 7.9, 8.1 months and not reached from Eras 1 through 5, respectively (P = 0.001). The median OS has improved: 9.6, 7.6, 14.4, 15.7, and 17.8 month from Eras 1-5, respectively (P = <0.001). Stem cell transplant as a time-dependent variable, showed better OS in the univariate analysis (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.84, P = 0.004) but did not retained its significance in multivariate analysis (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50-1.13, P = 0.16). Our data suggest improvement in outcome of FLT3 ITD mutated AML patients over the last 15 years. This is probably due to improvement in treatment strategies, including but not limited to integration of FLT3 inhibitors and increased use of SCT.","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS718386'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 1.,"1,2,3-Triazole-based heterocycles have previously been shown to possess significant anticancer activity in various tumor models. In the present study, we attached a 1,2,3-triazole moiety to the third position of a 1,2-benzisoxazole heterocycle via copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with various alkynes and established for the title compounds significant antiproliferative effect against human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Among the tested compounds, 3-(4-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)benzo[d]isoxazole (PTB) was found to be the most potent antiproliferative agent with an IC50 of 2 muM against MV4-11 cells using MTT assay. Notably, PTB induced cytotoxicity in MOLM13, MOLM14 and MV4-11 cells with selectivity over normal bone marrow cells (C57BL/6). Furthermore, PTB was found to induce cytotoxicity by increasing apoptosis of AML cells (MOLM13, MOLM14 and MV4-11) as well as sub-G1 cell population and apoptotic cells at submicromolar concentrations, as shown by flow cytometry and Annexin-V staining, respectively. On the protein level we suggested histone deacetylases (HDACs) as the potential protein target of those compounds in silico, and the predicted target was next experimentally validated by measuring the variations in the levels of p21, cyclin D and acetylation of histone H3 and tubulin. Molecular docking analysis of the title compounds with the second deacetylase domain of HDAC6 displayed high degree of shape complementarity to the binding site of the enzyme, forming multiple molecular interactions in the hydrophobic region as well as a hydrogen bond to the phenol side-chain of Tyr-782. Thus, 1,2,3-triazole derivatives appear to represent a class of novel, biologically active ligands against histone deacetylases which deserve to be further evaluated in their applications in the cancer field.",,"['0 (1,2-benzisoxazole)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed 90 patients: 42 males (mean age 54.5 years) and 48 females (mean age 59 years), with AML. The genetics of all leukemia samples was studied using conventional cytogenetics, the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation as well as the standardized RTPCR protocol. RESULTS: In 34.4% of patients, we detected at least one of the analysed genetic aberrations, except the CBFB MYH11, which we did not detect. Translocation t(8;21)/ AML1 ETO was found in 4.4% of patients with a mean age of 45.4 years, while none of these patients was older than 55 years. Translocation t(15;17)/ PMLRARA was found in 5.5% of patients with a mean age of 52.6 years and an almost equal distribution between younger and older patients. The MLL gene rearrangements were found in 6.6% of patients, the -5/ 5q- and/ or -7/ 7q- aberrations in 7.7% of patients, while the most frequent genetic abnormality in our study was trisomy 8 (10%). Moreover, we found a favorable clinical outcome in patients expressing fusion genes AML1-ETO or PMLRARA in contrast to an adverse clinical outcome with few remissions and death in AML patients with MLL, -5q/ -5 and -7q/ 7-. Finally, an intermediate prognosis was found in patients with trisomy 8. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found a good congruence with published literature on the incidence and prognostic value of several well established AML-associated genetic aberrations. This simple genetic-based classification system helps us to identify patients with a favorable, intermediate or unfavorable prognosis and to treat them with the best currently available therapy. However, analysis of new genetically defined abnormalities in AML is necessary for development of better therapeutic strategies and/or diagnostics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 20.,"Adjuvant systemic therapy along with screening has been key to the observed improvements in disease-free and overall survival (DFS/OS) in breast cancer. Improvements in overall survival already take into account therapy related toxicities that can result in death. However, this measure alone does not adequately capture the impact on health-related quality of life. Therefore, it is important to examine the prevalence, frequency and short/long-term impact of therapy-related toxicities, identify patients who might be at greatest risk. Ultimately decisions regarding expected therapy benefits (relative and absolute percentage improvements in DFS/OS) must be made against a background of known potential harms. For many patients with early breast cancer (EBC), their risk of recurrence is not zero but is small. At the same time, for many therapies for early stage breast cancer, the risk of serious side effects is small but is not zero. As we better understand the long-term side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy, it becomes critical to integrate our growing understanding of breast cancer biology with standard high-quality histopathologic measures to better identify the patients most likely to benefit from the various options for combined multimodality therapy. Hence, we must strive against the notion of recommending adjuvant systemic chemotherapy ""just in case."" This article focuses on the long-term side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with EBC.","['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our previous microRNA array data indicated that the miRNA let-7g level increases significantly during porcine ovary follicular atresia. It is uncertain if GCs apoptosis is mediated by microRNA let-7g. In this study, the expression levels of the apoptosis-associated genes CASP3, BAX and BIM were significantly upregulated when let-7g mimic was transfected into porcine GCs, and the anti-apoptotic genes BCL-2 and MCL-1 were significantly downregulated. The apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry, and our results indicated that let-7g significantly enhanced GCs apoptosis. In further studies, we found that overexpression of let-7g induced the expression of FoxO1 in GCs and led to nuclear accumulation of dephosphorylated FoxO1. In addition, the effect of let-7g on FoxO1 expression and dephosphorylation resulted from repression of the expression of the MAP3K1 gene in porcine GCs. The site on MAP3K1 mRNA targeted by let-7g was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. The anti-apoptotic effect of MAP3K1 was validated by silencing MAP3K1 using small interfering RNA technology. In conclusion, our data indicate that let-7g induces porcine GCs apoptosis by inhibiting the MAP3K1 gene, which promotes FoxO1 expression and dephosphorylation with nuclear accumulation.",,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

No hot spot TERT promoter mutations at -228C > T or -250C > T or POT1 mutations could be identified in this AML cohort.

In this novel study, we aimed to discover the anti-leukemic effect of ruxolitinib in K-562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line compared to NCI-BL 2171 human healthy B lymphocyte cell line. Cytotoxic effect of ruxolitinib was determined by using WST-1 assay. IC50 values for K-562 and NCI-BL 2171 cell lines were defined as 20 and 23.6 muM at the 48th hour, respectively. Autophagic effects of ruxolitinib were detected by measuring LC3B-II protein formation. Ruxolitinib induced autophagic cell death in K-562 and NCI-BL 2171 cell lines 2.11- and 1.79-fold compared to control groups, respectively. To determine the autophagy-related gene expression changes, total RNA was isolated from K-562 and NCI-BL 2171 cells treated with ruxolitinib and untreated cells as control group. Reverse transcription procedure was performed for cDNA synthesis, and gene expressions were shown by RT-qPCR. Ruxolitinib treatment caused a notable decrease in expression of AKT, mTOR, and STAT autophagy inhibitor genes in K-562 cells, contrariwise control cell line.

Despite the well-documented pathogenic role of BCR precursor (pre-BCR) pathway in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), there is limited available data of therapies that aim to disrupt this pathway. To investigate the role of protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta), a crucial mediator of BCR and pre-BCR signaling, in B-ALL survival, we studied the activity of the PKCbeta selective inhibitor enzastaurin (ENZ) in seven B-ALL cell lines. Treatment with ENZ resulted in a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition in all cell lines with a relatively higher efficacy in pro-B ALL with translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23). The mechanism of growth inhibition was by apoptotic induction and cell cycle arrest. A rapid reduction in phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream target glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) were observed at 30min after treatment and remaining for 48h. The reduction in GSK3beta phosphorylation was associated with a paradoxical accumulation of beta-catenin, which was due to a transient loss of beta-catenin phosphorylation at ser33-37. In addition, accumulation of beta-catenin was associated with downregulation of c-Myc, upregulatiuon of c-Jun, and a subsequent protective effect on the tumor suppressor p73.

Sero-epidemiological studies show that BLV infection occurs worldwide. Direct contact between infected and uninfected cattle is thought to be one of the risk factors for BLV transmission. Contact transmission occurs via a mixture of natural sources, blood, and exudates. To confirm that BLV provirus is detectable in these samples, matched blood, nasal secretion, and saliva samples were collected from 50 cattle, and genomic DNA was extracted. BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2, an assay developed for the highly sensitive detection of BLV, was then used to measure the proviral load in blood (n=50), nasal secretions (n=48), and saliva (n=47) samples. The results showed that 35 blood samples, 14 nasal secretion samples, and 6 saliva samples were positive for the BLV provirus. Matched blood samples from cattle that were positive for the BLV provirus (either in nasal secretion or saliva samples) were also positive in their blood. The proviral load in the positive blood samples was >14,000 (copies/1x10(5) cells). Thus, even though the proviral load in the nasal secretion and saliva samples was much lower (<380 copies/1x10(5) cells) than that in the peripheral blood, prolonged direct contact between infected and healthy cattle may be considered as a risk factor for BLV transmission.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2015 Aug 21.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells reside in the bone marrow microenvironment which nurtures and protects cells from chemotherapeutic drugs. The disruption of cell-cell communication within the leukemic niche may offer an important new therapeutic strategy. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) have been described as a novel mode of intercellular communication, but their presence and importance in the leukemic niche are currently unknown. Here, we show for the first time that primary B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) cells use TNTs to signal to primary mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). This signaling results in secretion of prosurvival cytokines, such as interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10/CXC chemokine ligand 10, interleukin 8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CC chemokine ligand 2. A combination of TNT-disrupting conditions allows us to analyze the functional importance of TNTs in an ex vivo model. Our results indicate that TNT signaling is important for the viability of patient-derived B-cell precursor ALL cells and induces stroma-mediated prednisolone resistance. Disruption of TNTs significantly inhibits these leukemogenic processes and resensitizes B-cell precursor ALL cells to prednisolone. Our findings establish TNTs as a novel communication mechanism by which ALL cells modulate their bone marrow microenvironment. The identification of TNT signaling in ALL-MSC communication gives insight into the pathobiology of ALL and opens new avenues to develop more effective therapies that interfere with the leukemic niche.",,"['0 (Cytokines)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7815-1202', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6424-0025']",,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 21.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the pathways by which children with cancer present to a shared care oncology unit. DESIGN: A population-based retrospective cohort study of children diagnosed with cancer between the years 2004 and 2014. SETTING: District General Hospital with a level 2 Paediatric Oncology Shared Care Unit. PATIENTS: 93 children aged 0-15 years . OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to presentation (TTP) was defined as time from initial symptoms to time seen by secondary paediatrics. Time to diagnosis (TTD) was defined as time from initial symptoms to diagnosis at a Principal Treatment Centre. Patient pathways to diagnosis were mapped and routes for different cancers were compared. RESULTS: Only 2/93 cases (2.1%) in 10 years were referred via the 2-week pathway. Most presentations were acute via immediate general practitioner (GP) referral or self-referral to the emergency department 62/93 (67%). Leukaemia presented acutely and via the GP more often than via self-presentation to the emergency department 21/28 (75% vs 25%), while solid tumours were self-referred to the emergency department 21/34 (62% vs 38%) more often than via the GP. TTP and TTD were calculated for 87 patients. Wilms' tumour demonstrated the shortest median TTP of 7 days and TTD of 16 days. Lymphoma had the longest TTD, with TTP 107 days and TTD 120 days. Pathways to diagnosis via other specialties were longer. CONCLUSION: The majority of children diagnosed with cancer present via acute services, with the route varying between tumour types. Only two cases in 10 years were referred via the 2-week pathway, thus challenging its relevance in the paediatric population.",,,,"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Here we investigated the STAT3/myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) signaling pathway as a target to overcome the resistance of glioma cells to the Bcl-2-inhibiting synthetic BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Stable lentiviral knockdown of MCL1 sensitized LN229 and U87 glioma cells to apoptotic cell death induced by single-agent treatment with ABT-737 which was associated with an early activation of DEVDase activity, cytochrome c release, and nuclear apoptosis. Similar sensitizing effects were observed when ABT-737 treatment was combined with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib which effectively suppressed levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and MCL1 in MCL1-proficient LN229 and U87 glioma cells. In analogous fashion, these synergistic effects were observed when we combined ABT-737 with the STAT3 inhibitor WP-1066. Lentiviral knockdown of the activating transcription factor 5 combined with subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that sorafenib-dependent suppression of MCL1 occurred at the transcriptional level but did not depend on activating transcription factor 5 which previously had been proposed to be essential for MCL1-dependent glioma cell survival. In contrast, the constitutively active STAT3 mutant STAT3-C was able to significantly enhance MCL1 levels under sorafenib treatment to retain cell survival. Collectively, these data demonstrate that sorafenib targets MCL1 in a STAT3-dependent manner, thereby sensitizing glioma cells to treatment with ABT-737.

We have developed a high-resolution analytical pipeline, Immune Monitor (""IMonitor"") to tackle this task. This method utilizes realignment to identify V(D)J genes and alleles after common local alignment. We compare IMonitor with other published tools by simulated and public rearranged sequences, and it demonstrates its superior performance in most aspects. Together with this, a methodology is developed to correct the PCR and sequencing errors and to minimize the PCR bias among various rearranged sequences with different V and J gene families. IMonitor provides general adaptation for sequences from all receptor chains of different species and outputs useful statistics and visualizations. In the final part of this article, we demonstrate its application on minimal residual disease detection in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Epub 2015 Aug 22.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a disease of bone marrow stem cells caused by excessive growth and accumulation of granulocytes in the blood. Aberrant expression of the BCR-ABL proteins in bone marrow stem cells have found out in 95 % cases of CML. Tyrosine Kinase domains (SH2 and SH3) of BCR-ABL proteins are the potent targets to inhibit the process. Initially, imatinib is preferred as an efficient inhibitor to control functional activity of disease. Recently, it has been reported that the advanced stage of CML developed resistance against imatinib. In continuation, dasatinib is the first drug to combat against this disease by targeting multiple receptors and proven better as compared to imatinib. Here, an attempt has been made to identify similar analogs of dasatinib. Virtual screening was performed against various natural compound databases to get some potent natural compounds which are able to inhibit more than one receptor. Binding affinity of screened natural compounds was compared with some of the well-known inhibitors like imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib etc., by analyzing their docking score and binding efficiency with the receptor. Stability of the best ligand-receptor complex was checked by performing 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation. ADMET properties of the obtained screened compounds were analyzed to check drug like property. Based on the aforementioned analysis, it has been suggested that these screened potent compounds are capable to inhibit multiple receptor proteins like ABL and SRC and consequently combat against the deadly disease CML.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 22.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are found in innate immune cells, are essential mediators of rapid inflammatory responses and appropriate T-cell activation in response to infection and tissue damage. Accumulating evidence suggests that TLR signaling is involved in normal hematopoiesis and specific hematologic pathologies. Particular TLRs and their downstream signaling mediators are expressed not only in terminally differentiated innate immune cells but also in early hematopoietic progenitors. Sterile activation of TLR signaling is required to generate early embryonic hematopoietic progenitor cells. In adult animals, TLR signaling directly or indirectly promotes differentiation of myeloid cells at the expense of that of lymphoid cells and the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells during infection and tissue damage. Activating mutations of the MyD88 gene, which codes for a key adaptor involved in TLR signaling, are commonly detected in B-cell lymphomas and other B-cell hematopathologies. Dysregulated TLR signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of many hematopoietic disorders, including bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia. Complete elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which TLR signaling mediates the regulation of both normal and pathogenic hematopoiesis will prove valuable to the development of targeted therapies and strategies for improved treatment of hematopoietic disorders.",['R01 HL95896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mortality rate is unacceptably high and depends on 3 factors: the host (performance status, comorbidities, and frailty), the etiology of the infiltrates and the type of response to antileukemic therapy. The approach to the diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with AL includes a medical history, thorough physical examination, radiologic pattern of the infiltrates (focal vs. diffuse), and timing of their appearance in relation to the start of antileukemic therapy (early, ie, within the first 2 weeks or late). Localized infiltrates are most commonly caused by bacterial (early) and fungal infections (late). Diffuse early infiltrates might be caused by leukemic infiltration of the lungs, pulmonary hemorrhage and/or edema, diffuse alveolar damage, viral pneumonia, and rarely transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or the differentiation syndrome. Similar to the early phase, pulmonary edema, viral pneumonia, and rarely TRALI might cause diffuse infiltrates during the late phase, in addition to immune reconstitution and pneumocystosis, particularly among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Diagnostic tests, invasive and noninvasive, can be particularly useful to establish the diagnosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From > 2000 cases of hematological malignancies seen at our institution between 2000 and 2013, we identified 9 AML patients with 5q33 translocations with variable partner loci, t(v;5q33). RESULTS: The study group included 8 men and 1 woman, with a median age of 64 years (range, 19-87 years). Four patients had an antecedent myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Cytogenetic analysis showed t(v;5q33) as a sole chromosomal abnormality in 4 (44%) patients, t(v;5q33) and del(3)(q21;q26.2) in 1 (11%) patient, and a complex karyotype in 4 (44%) patients. Only 1 patient had morphologic features of myelodysplasia in 2 or more lineages. Follow-up was available for 7 patients and the median overall survival (OS) was 12 months. Patients with a history of MPN had a significantly shorter OS compared with those with de novo AML (11 vs. 20 months; P = .0445). There was no correlation between complex karyotype and OS in this small group of AML patients (P = .5904). CONCLUSION: The t(v;5q33) is a rare cytogenetic aberration in AML. Although associated with a poor outcome, AML with t(v;5q33) usually lacks morphologic evidence of multilineage dysplasia. Patients who have AML with t(v;5q33) after MPN have a worse OS compared with those with de novo AML.",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This has led to the change in the classification and management of AML patients. Because no molecular studies regarding AML characterization in Lebanese patients had yet been reported, we decided to determine in our institution the prevalence of the recurrent genetic rearrangements t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17) and Fms-like (Suzanne McDonough feline sarcoma) tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fusion gene transcripts from chromosome aberrations were analyzed according to standardized reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions after the report of BIOMED-1 concerted action: investigation of minimal residual disease in acute leukemia. FLT3 and NPM1 mutations were screened using home-brew methodologies. RESULTS: We reviewed 144 bone marrow samples from AML patients referred to Saint George Hospital for molecular and cytogenetic studies from September 2006 to July 2014. The male to female patient ratio was 1.34 to 1. We detected the inv(16) in 6 patients [4.2%] (type A, 5 [83%]; type D, 1 [17%]), t(8;21) in 7 patients [4.9%] (e5e2), and t(15;17) in 36 patients [25.0%] (24 [67%] breakpoint cluster region 1 (bcr1), 12 [33%] bcr3). Other chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 8, complex karyotype, t(6;9),...) were found in 44 patients [31.4%] and 51 [35.5%] cases showed normal karyotype. Among the normal karyotypes, 6 patients [11.8%] were FLT3-positive (4 [67%] internal tandem duplication [ITD], 2 [33%] D835V), 8 [15.7%] had type A NPM1 mutation and 8 [15.7%] type A NPM1 and FLT3/ITD concomitantly. CONCLUSION: Our results, except for the prevalence of acute promyelocytic leukemia, are concordant with those reported in the literature with approximately 35% of the patients cytogenetically normal. Testing patients with normal karyotype for other molecular markers such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha mutations, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations, and mixed lineage leukemia rearrangements could therefore provide additional prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic values for AML patients.",,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: In vitro treatment of the human FLT-3 ITD-mutant AML cell line, MV4-11, with both drugs significantly improved growth inhibition over single-agent therapy and resulted in synergistic antitumor effects (combination index < 1). A case series of 6 patients treated with off protocol combination of decitabine and sorafenib demonstrated overall responses in 5 patients (83%) with a median survival of 155 days. Four of the 5 patients (80%) with relapsed/refractory AML achieved complete responses with incomplete count recovery. The combination was also well tolerated.

However, the effect of body mass index (BMI) on survival outcome remains controversial in acute leukemia (AL) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 531 adults with AL who entered clinical trials in our institution between 1994 and 2012 were analyzed retrospectively for the effect of BMI at diagnosis on outcome. The median follow-up was 4.7 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-5.1). RESULTS: BMI had no significant effect on complete response rate, disease-free survival (DFS), or overall survival (OS) in patients from the whole cohort when considering a cutoff value for BMI of 25, and when analyzed according to age, or initial cytogenetics. In T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients with BMI > 25, median DFS was not reached with a 3-year DFS at 76%, and median DFS was 16.1 months with 3-year DFS at 13% for those with BMI </= 25 (P = .005). Median OS was not reached in T-ALL patients with BMI > 25 versus 28.3 months in those with BMI </= 25 (3-year OS: 78% vs. 41%; P = .04). Multivariate analyses confirmed the prognostic value of BMI (> 25 vs. < 25) in T-ALL, but only in terms of DFS (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.05-0.87; P = .037). However, in a validation cohort of 211 T-ALL patients, these results were not confirmed. CONCLUSION: Results from the literature are very heterogeneous and contradictory regarding the effect of BMI on leukemia outcome. Even if nutritional status during chemotherapy courses is critical, these findings provide further evidence that initial body size does not have a major prognostic effect on survival in AL patients.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Clinically, PV is an indolent disease, but its course can be complicated by arterial and venous vascular incidents, evolution to myelofibrosis, or leukemic transformation. Treatment of PV is therefore aimed at preventing such acute complications. The cornerstone of therapy of low-risk patients remains strict control of cardiovascular risk factors, the use of phlebotomy, and low-dose aspirin. Higher-risk patients should also receive cytoreductive treatments. Hydroxyurea and interferon alpha represent standard first-line options for newly diagnosed high-risk PV patients. Recommendations for patients whose disease fails to respond to these therapies are less clearly defined. The discovery of a mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) 2 gene (V617F) in almost all cases of PV has prompted the development of molecularly targeted agents for the treatment of these patients.

The incidence of myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, is increased in CLL and has been linked to previous therapy. In this study, we aim at describing characteristics and determining risk factors for developing second myeloid disorders (SMDs) in patients with CLL. From a total of 1269 patients diagnosed with CLL during the study time period, 30 (2.4%) were found to have an SMD. The majority of SMDs were myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (76.7%). The median time from diagnosis of CLL to diagnosis of SMD was 4.47 years. Most patients who developed an SMD had received treatment for their CLL (86%). The median time from treatment of CLL to diagnosis of SMD was 4.19 years. The overall survival of patients with CLL with no second malignancy was significantly longer than those with an SMD (11.9 vs. 7.1 years, P = .001). There was no association between developing SMD and age, gender, expression of CD38, expression of ZAP-70, and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene status. The risk of developing SMD in our cohort was higher in patients who received fludarabine- or alkylator-based therapy. Our analysis is one of the largest series showing that patients receiving fludarabine or alkylator-based therapies for CLL have a higher risk of developing SMD. Our study also confirms previous reports that prognostic factors in CLL do not increase the risk for development of SMD. Clinicians should understand the leukemogenicity of fludarabine or alkylator-based treatments when considering treatments for patients with CLL.",['UL1 TR000077/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We compared the outcome of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia patients who received a first allo-HSCT in our center in both the pre-TKI era and the TKI era. The primary end point was to compare the 2 groups' overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality, and relapse incidence. The secondary end point was to underline in the TKI era the impact of the pretransplantation minimal residual disease (MRD) on the outcomes. A total of 69 patients with Ph+ leukemia were included and their outcomes analyzed. For the purpose of this analysis, we defined 2 groups: group A (n = 39) included patients treated in the pre-TKI era, treated from January 1989 until December 2001, and group B (n = 30) included patients treated in the TKI era, treated from January 2002 until December 2013. Additional analysis was performed in group B for whom detailed TKIs and MRD data were collected. The study took place in our cancer center in the department of HSCT, Villejuif, France. The median follow-up duration for group A was 116.1 months (range, 1.1 to 240.1 months) and for group B was 8.3 months (range, 3.5 to 141.7 months). At 3 years, the LFS and OS were higher in group B (respectively, 66% and 71%) than in group A (respectively, 63% and 57%) (P > .05). The LFS and OS at 3 years of the pretransplantation MRD-negative (< 0.01%) patients were significantly (P < .05) higher (respectively, 83% and 94%) than the pretransplantation MRD-positive patients (respectively, 43% and 46%). Our data, although statistically not significant, suggest better outcomes for Ph+ leukemia patients undergoing allo-HSCT in the TKI era. Mostly TKI does not adversely affect the transplantation outcomes and can be used successfully as a bridge to allo-HSCT, especially in advanced disease. In addition, we highlight the importance of obtaining deep pretransplantation MRD negativity.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ancestral or additional genetic events necessary for CML to develop have long been hypothesized but never really demonstrated. CML can successfully be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

The factors predicting molecular response at 3, 6, and 12 months have not been studied extensively. The study objective was to study the factors affecting molecular response at 3 and 6 months in patients with CML who are receiving imatinib mesylate. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with newly diagnosed CML who were receiving imatinib mesylate as the initial therapy for CML. The diagnosis of CML was based on clinical examination, bone marrow, and demonstration of BCR ABL(IS) transcripts by polymerase chain reaction. The molecular response(IS) was assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months by GeneXpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and co-related with various baseline characteristics of patients. We also looked at whether early achievement of a complete hematologic response within 6 weeks predicts molecular response at 3 or 6 months. The study took place at a tertiary care hospital in Northwest India catering to patients belonging to low-middle socioeconomic status. RESULTS: We enrolled 131 patients with CML in the chronic phase from July 1, 2013, to August 31, 2014. The median age of the patients was 40 years (range, 13-67) with a male preponderance (61% were male). Most patients presented with symptoms of low-grade fever (52.7%) and abdominal fullness (26.7%). Spleen was palpable in 84.7% of patients. The median hemoglobin at presentation was 10.8 g/dL (range, 4.8-18.4 g/dL), white cell count was 138.3 x 10(9)/L (4.1-697 x 10(9)/L), and platelet count was 326 x 10(9)/L (85-1819 x 10(9)/L). The median number of peripheral blood basophils was 3% (range, 0%-20%), and blasts were 3% (range, 0%-10%). Myelofibrosis of more than grade 1 was present in 30% of patients. Most patients belonged to intermediate Sokal (45.8%) and Hasford (55%) scores and low EUropean Treatment Outcome Study (78.6%) score. Of 128 evaluable patients at 3 months, 96.9% achieved complete hematologic remission (CHR) and 82.3% achieved BCR ABL(IS) of less than 10%. None of the patients who had BCR ABL(IS) > 10% at 3 months achieved BCR ABL(IS) < 1% at 6 months or < 0.1% at 12 months. Early achievement of CHR (< 6 weeks), peripheral blood blast count of < 5%, and lactate dehydrogenase < 851 U/L were significantly associated with achievement of BCR ABL(IS) < 10% at 3 months and BCR ABL(IS) < 1% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: We found that BCR ABL(IS) assessment at 3 months is superior to assessment at 6 months. Patients with CML in the chronic phase who achieve CHR within 6 weeks are more likely to achieve BCR ABL(IS) < 10% at 3 months and < 1% at 6 months than patients who achieve CHR between 7 and 12 weeks.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The outcome after relapse is not uniform in all patients with AML and is dependent on several prognostic variables, including age, cytogenetics at initial diagnosis, duration of first complete remission, whether an allogeneic stem cell transplant was performed during first complete remission, and the presence of a number of molecular aberrations. Despite extensive research over the past several decades, there is no standard of care for treating patients with relapsed AML. This is possibly due to the accrual of patients with widely different disease profiles in most trials for relapsed AML. With increasing insights into the disease biology based on identification of pathogenic and aberrant molecular and cellular pathways, novel therapeutic strategies are emerging. Hopefully in the near future, we can improve the outcome of patients with relapsed AML with treatment strategies based on identification of specific targets and methods to overcome these aberrant processes.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Jul 8.,"There are currently no effective prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer. Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), a transcriptional repressor, has a role in cell cycle progression and tumorigenicity in various cancers. The expression and value of PLZF in lung carcinoma, particularly in the subclass of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), has not been studied. Our aim was to study the immunohistochemical expression of PLZF in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and correlate the alteration of PLZF expression with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, tumor stage, and overall survival. A total of 296 NSCLCs being mounted on tissue microarray (181 adenocarcinomas and 91 squamous cell carcinomas) were investigated. Moderate to strong expression of PLZF was found in the cytoplasm of all the nonneoplastic respiratory epithelium and most (89.9%) well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The proportions of moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and paired lymph node adenocarcinoma metastases that demonstrated negative or only weak PLZF reactivity were 75.6%, 97.2%, and 89.9%, respectively. The expression of PLZF in squamous cell carcinoma was mostly weak or absent and significantly lower than that in adenocarcinoma of the same grade (P < .0005). The loss of cytoplasmic PLZF strongly correlated with high tumor grade and lymph node metastasis in both squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (P < .0001). Down-regulation of PLZF also correlated with higher tumor stage and shorter overall survival (P < .05). These results support a prognostic value for loss of cytoplasmic PLZF expression in the stratification of NSCLC and a possible role of cytoplasmic shift and down-regulation of PLZF in the pathogenesis of NSCLC.",['UL1 TR000042/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the utility of GM-CSF with chemoimmunotherapy in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in a pilot study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated, relapsed, or refractory indolent NHL or CLL were treated with GM-CSF, rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide or mitoxantrone for a maximum of 6 cycles. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled, including 1 patient who did not receive study therapy. Of the 15 remaining patients, 6 received cyclophosphamide and 9 received mitoxantrone in combination with fludarabine, rituximab, and GM-CSF. The overall response rate for all patients was 87%. Nine patients have subsequently had relapse of their disease, and 6 remained in remission at last study contact. There were no toxic deaths during the study. CONCLUSION: GM-CSF-based chemoimmunotherapy was well-tolerated and resulted in a high response rate and warrants evaluation in larger studies.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 family cytokine, promotes progression of various carcinomas. To investigate the role of LIF in cholangiocarcinoma, we evaluated the expression of LIF and its receptor (LIFR) in human samples. LIF secretion and LIFR expression were assessed in established and primary human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. In cholangiocarcinoma cells, we tested LIF effects on proliferation, invasion, stem cell-like phenotype, chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (gemcitabine+cisplatin), expression levels of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Mcl-1) proteins, with/without PI3K inhibition, and of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, pAKT. LIF effect on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was evaluated after LIFR silencing and Mcl-1 inactivation.Results show that LIF and LIFR expression were higher in neoplastic than in control cholangiocytes; LIF was also expressed by tumor stromal cells. LIF had no effects on cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation, invasion, and stemness signatures, whilst it counteracted drug-induced apoptosis. Upon LIF stimulation, decreased apoptosis was associated with Mcl-1 and pAKT up-regulation and abolished by PI3K inhibition. LIFR silencing and Mcl-1 blockade restored drug-induced apoptosis.In conclusion, autocrine and paracrine LIF signaling promote chemoresistance in cholangiocarcinoma by up-regulating Mcl-1 via a novel STAT3- and MAPK-independent, PI3K/AKT-dependent pathway. Targeting LIF signaling may increase CCA responsiveness to chemotherapy.","['P30 DK034989/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5P30DK034989/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK079005/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 19.,"BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating agents are used to treat cancers driven by aberrant DNA methylation, but their short half-life might limit their activity, particularly in patients with less proliferative diseases. Guadecitabine (SGI-110) is a novel hypomethylating dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine resistant to degradation by cytidine deaminase. We aimed to assess the safety and clinical activity of subcutaneously given guadecitabine in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, phase 1 study, patients from nine North American medical centres with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia that was refractory to or had relapsed after standard treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous guadecitabine, either once-daily for 5 consecutive days (daily x 5), or once-weekly for 3 weeks, in a 28-day treatment cycle. Patients were stratified by disease. A 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used in which we treated patients with guadecitabine doses of 3-125 mg/m(2) in separate dose-escalation cohorts. A twice-weekly treatment schedule was added to the study after a protocol amendment. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of guadecitabine, determine the maximum tolerated and biologically effective dose, and identify the recommended phase 2 dose of guadecitabine. Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of guadecitabine. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses to determine the biologically effective dose included all patients for whom samples were available. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01261312. FINDINGS: Between Jan 4, 2011, and April 11, 2014, we enrolled and treated 93 patients: 35 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and nine patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in the daily x 5 dose-escalation cohorts, 28 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and six patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in the once-weekly dose-escalation cohorts, and 11 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in the twice-weekly dose-escalation cohorts. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were febrile neutropenia (38 [41%] of 93 patients), pneumonia (27 [29%] of 93 patients), thrombocytopenia (23 [25%] of 93 patients), anaemia (23 [25%] of 93 patients), and sepsis (16 [17%] of 93 patients). The most common serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (29 [31%] of 93 patients), pneumonia (26 [28%] of 93 patients), and sepsis (16 [17%] of 93 patients). Six of the 74 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and six of the 19 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome had a clinical response to treatment. Two dose-limiting toxicities were noted in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome at 125 mg/m(2) daily x 5, thus the maximum tolerated dose in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome was 90 mg/m(2) daily x 5. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Potent dose-related DNA demethylation occurred on the daily x 5 regimen, reaching a plateau at 60 mg/m(2) (designated as the biologically effective dose). INTERPRETATION: Guadecitabine given subcutaneously at 60 mg/m(2) daily x 5 is well tolerated and is clinically and biologically active in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. Guadecitabine 60 mg/m(2) daily x 5 is the recommended phase 2 dose, and these findings warrant further phase 2 studies.

Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is a type of leukemia that targets the lymphoid line of blood cells. As the comparison of these two types facilitates in the understanding of their molecular pathology, exploring the similarities and differences in the mechanisms of them is worthwhile. We identified 28 novel AML- and ALL-related genes shared in both of them using a short path algorithm. By integrating gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway annotations, we revealed the underlying molecular features of AML and ALL. We finally obtained 160 optimal GO terms that could satisfactorily distinguish two types. Further analysis revealed that the results agree well with previous knowledge. Determining the common and different features between AML and ALL facilitates the classification of leukemia and is thus clinically relevant for exploring the molecular markers.",,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Those of the syringolin family have been underexploited in this context. Using the published model for substrate mimicry by the syringolins and knowledge about the substrate preferences of the proteolytic subunits of the human proteasome, we have designed, synthesized, and evaluated syringolin analogs. As some of our analogs inhibit the activity of the proteasome with second-order rate constants 5-fold greater than that of the methyl ester of syringolin B, we conclude that the substrate mimicry model for the syringolins is valid.

In part 1 of this two-part study, a 7-day CC-486 dosing schedule showed clinical activity, was generally well tolerated, and reduced DNA methylation. Extending dosing of CC-486 beyond 7 days would increase duration of azacitidine exposure. We hypothesized that extended dosing would therefore provide more sustained epigenetic activity. Reported here are the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of CC-486 extended dosing schedules in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from part 2 of this study. PK and/or PD data were available for 59 patients who were sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 extended CC-486 dosing schedules: 300mg once-daily or 200mg twice-daily for 14 or 21 days per 28-day cycle. Both 300mg once-daily schedules and the 200mg twice-daily 21-day schedule significantly (all P < .05) reduced global DNA methylation in whole blood at all measured time points (days 15, 22, and 28 of the treatment cycle), with sustained hypomethylation at cycle end compared with baseline. CC-486 exposures and reduced DNA methylation were significantly correlated. Patients who had a hematologic response had significantly greater methylation reductions than non-responding patients. These data demonstrate that extended dosing of CC-486 sustains epigenetic effects through the treatment cycle.

HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is the only viral gene that is constitutively expressed in HTLV-1-infected cells, and it has multiple functions on T-cell signaling pathways. HBZ has important roles in HTLV-1-mediated pathogenesis, since HBZ transgenic (HBZ-Tg) mice develop systemic inflammation and T-cell lymphomas, which are similar phenotypes to HTLV-1-associated diseases. We showed previously that in HBZ-Tg mice, HBZ causes unstable Foxp3 expression, leading to an increase in regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the consequent induction of IFN-gamma-producing cells, which in turn leads to the development of inflammation in the mice. In this study, we show that the severity of inflammation is correlated with the development of lymphomas in HBZ-Tg mice, suggesting that HBZ-mediated inflammation is closely linked to oncogenesis in CD4+ T cells. In addition, we found that IFN-gamma-producing cells enhance HBZ-mediated inflammation, since knocking out IFN-gamma significantly reduced the incidence of dermatitis as well as lymphoma. Recent studies show the critical roles of the intestinal microbiota in the development of Tregs in vivo. We found that even germ-free HBZ-Tg mice still had an increased number of Tregs and IFN-gamma-producing cells, and developed dermatitis, indicating that an intrinsic activity of HBZ evokes aberrant T-cell differentiation and consequently causes inflammation. These results show that immunomodulation by HBZ is implicated in both inflammation and oncogenesis, and suggest a causal connection between HTLV-1-associated inflammation and ATL.",,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,['GEO/GSE69804'],,['PLoS Pathog. 2015 Oct;11(10):e1005214.

Using human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines engineered to overexpress individual T-cell ligands, we found that expression of the inhibitory ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, reduced the cytolytic activity of the BiTE antibody construct targeting CD33, AMG 330; conversely, expression of the activating ligands, CD80 and CD86, augmented the cytotoxic activity of AMG 330. Consistent with these findings, treatment with an activating antibody directed at the co-stimulatory T-cell receptor, CD28, significantly increased AMG 330-induced cytotoxicity in human AML cell lines. Using specimens from 12 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML, we found that activation of CD28 also increased the activity of AMG 330 in primary human AML cells (P=0.023). Together, our findings indicate that T-cell ligands and co-receptors modulate the anti-tumor activity of the CD33/CD3 BiTE antibody construct, AMG 330.

In the present study we focused on mucus produced by a benthic cnidarian, the sea anemone Actinia equina (Linnaeus, 1758) for preventing burial by excess sedimentation and for protection. We investigated some of the physico-chemical properties of this matrix such as viscosity, osmolarity, electrical conductivity, protein, carbohydrate, and total lipid contents. Some biological activities such as hemolytic, cytotoxic, and antibacterial lysozyme-like activities were also studied. The A. equina mucus is mainly composed by water (96.2% +/- 0.3%), whereas its dry weight is made of 24.2% +/- 1.3% proteins and 7.8% +/- 0.2% carbohydrates, with the smallest and largest components referable to lipids (0.9%) and inorganic matter (67.1%). The A. equina mucus matrix exhibited hemolytic activity on rabbit erythrocytes, cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell line K562 (human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia) and antibacterial lysozyme-like activity. The findings from this study improve the available information on the mucus composition in invertebrates and have implications for future investigations related to exploitation of A. equina and other sea anemones' mucus as a source of bioactive compounds of high pharmaceutical and biotechnological interest.",,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Cnidarian Venoms)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Hemolytic Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results obtained with solutions indicate that influence of variables such as pH, viscosity, salt composition, and various proteins on the absorption spectrum of BO21 is negligible. However, in the presence of heparin, a blue shift (484-465 nm) is observed, which is attributed to the aggregation of BO21 on the polyanion. Applying density functional theory demonstrates that in aqueous solutions (a) the formation of BO21 oligomers is thermodynamically favorable, they are oriented in an antiparallel dipolar arrangement, and their binding energies are lower than those of parallel dipolar arrangements, (b) association between BO21 aggregates and heparin is highly favorable, and (c) the blue shift is due to the mixing of pi --> pi* transitions caused by BO21 molecule stacking. However, when embedded in basophils, the absorption spectra of intracellular BO21 is extremely red-shifted, with two peaks (at 505 and 550 nm) found to be attributed to BO21 and the BO21-heparin complex, respectively, which are intracellularly hosted in nonaqueous environments.

The non-genomic loss of function of tumor suppressors offers a challenging therapeutic opportunity. The reactivation of a tumor suppressor could indeed promote selective apoptosis of cancer cells without affecting normal cells. The identification of mechanisms that affect tumor suppressor functions is therefore essential. In this work, we show that BCR-ABL promotes the accumulation of the NFKBIA gene product, IkappaBalpha, in the cytosol through physical interaction and stabilization of the protein. Furthermore, BCR-ABL/IkappaBalpha complex acts as a scaffold protein favoring p53 nuclear exclusion.

Epub 2015 Aug 20.,"SAMHD1 is a cellular protein that plays key roles in HIV-1 restriction and regulation of cellular dNTP levels. Mutations in SAMHD1 are also implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome. The anti-HIV-1 activity of SAMHD1 is negatively modulated by phosphorylation at residue Thr-592. The mechanism underlying the effect of phosphorylation on anti-HIV-1 activity remains unclear. SAMHD1 forms tetramers that possess deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) activity, which is allosterically controlled by the combined action of GTP and all four dNTPs. Here we demonstrate that the phosphomimetic mutation T592E reduces the stability of the SAMHD1 tetramer and the dNTPase activity of the enzyme. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we determined the crystal structures of SAMHD1 variants T592E and T592V. Although the neutral substitution T592V does not perturb the structure, the charged T592E induces large conformational changes, likely triggered by electrostatic repulsion from a distinct negatively charged environment surrounding Thr-592. The phosphomimetic mutation results in a significant decrease in the population of active SAMHD1 tetramers, and hence the dNTPase activity is substantially decreased. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how SAMHD1 phosphorylation at residue Thr-592 may modulate its cellular and antiviral functions.","['AI104483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI104483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI120845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 AI120845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI102778/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI102778/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAMHD1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,"['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,"['PDB/4BZB', 'PDB/4TNR', 'PDB/4ZWE', 'PDB/4ZWG']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 20.,"An aberrant interaction between hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stromal cells has been linked to disease and shown to contribute to the pathophysiology of hematologic malignancies in murine models. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia is an aggressive malignant disease affecting young infants. Here we investigated the impact of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia on mesenchymal stromal cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells were expanded from bone marrow samples of patients at diagnosis (n=9) and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n=7; from 5 patients) and from healthy children (n=10). Cells were characterized by phenotyping, differentiation, gene expression analysis (of controls and samples obtained at diagnosis) and in vitro functional studies assessing immunomodulation and hematopoietic support. Mesenchymal stromal cells from patients did not differ from controls in differentiation capacity nor did they differ in their capacity to support in vitro hematopoiesis. Deep-SAGE sequencing revealed differential mRNA expression in patient-derived samples, including genes encoding proteins involved in immunomodulation and cell-cell interaction. Selected gene expression normalized during remission after successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Whereas natural killer cell activation and peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation were not differentially affected, the suppressive effect on monocyte to dendritic cell differentiation was increased by mesenchymal stromal cells obtained at diagnosis, but not at time of remission. This study shows that active juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia affects the immune response-related gene expression and function of mesenchymal stromal cells. In contrast, the differential gene expression of hematopoiesis-related genes could not be supported by functional data. Decreased immune surveillance might contribute to the therapy resistance and progression in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.",,,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 20.,"Relapsed precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is characterized by resistance against chemotherapy and is frequently fatal. We aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms resulting in relapse of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and analyzed 13 patients at first diagnosis, remission and relapse by whole exome sequencing, targeted ultra-deep sequencing, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification and DNA methylation array. Compared to primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in relapse the number of single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions approximately doubled from 11.5 to 26. Targeted ultra-deep sequencing sensitively detected subclones that were selected for in relapse. The mutational pattern defined two types of relapses. While both are characterized by selection of subclones and acquisition of novel mutations, 'type 1' relapse derives from the primary leukemia whereas 'type 2' relapse originates from a common pre-leukemic ancestor. Relapse-specific changes included activation of the nucleotidase NT5C2 resulting in resistance to chemotherapy and mutations of epigenetic modulators, exemplified by SUZ12, WHSC1 and SMARCA4. While mutations present in primary leukemia and in relapse were enriched for known drivers of leukemia, relapse-specific changes revealed an association with general cancer-promoting mechanisms. This study thus identifies mechanisms that drive progression of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia to relapse and may explain the characteristic treatment resistance of this condition.",,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",['Haematologica. 2015 Nov;100(11):1373-5.

Epub 2015 Aug 22.,"The aim of the study is to better understand the mechanism of relapse and acquired clinical resistance to arsenic trioxide (ATO) and/or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Thirty relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients were followed. Fifteen patients experienced two or more relapses; nine patients had clinical resistance to ATO-based therapy. The frequency and clinical significance of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) mutational status using Sanger sequencing were evaluated. Overall, eight different types of mutations in the RARA region (V218D, R272Q, T278A, T291I, N299D, R294W, A300G, and L220_F228delinsP) were identified in 11 patients. Eight missense mutations (L211P, C213R, S214L, A216V, L217F, D219H, S221G, and D241G) were found in the PML portion of PML-RARA in 14 patients, with A216V as the predominant mutation. Eight patients were found to harbor both PML and RARA mutations over the course of the disease. The PML-region mutations were associated with response to ATO-based therapy (P < 0.0001), number of relapses (P = 0.001), and early relapse (P = 0.013). Notably, one case sampled at nine different time points showed alternating clonal dominance over the course of treatment. This study demonstrated frequent mutations of PML-RARA and supported a clonal selection model in relation to APL relapse and ATO resistance.",,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 20.,"PURPOSE: To describe novel underlying associations of classic acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN). METHODS: Multimodal imaging case series evaluating patients with classic AMN lesions and previously unreported underlying aetiologies. RESULTS: Six patients were included (five women, one man, mean age 30+/-7 years). Mean distance best corrected visual acuity at initial presentation was 0.21+/-0.3 logMAR (mean Snellen acuity: 20/30, range 20/15-20/100) and at last follow-up visit 0.09+/-0.17 logMAR (Snellen acuity: 20/20, range 20/15-20/60). All cases but one had bilateral lesions and showed typical parafoveal hyporeflective lesions on infrared imaging, which corresponded to the hyper-reflectivity in the Henle's layer with attenuation of the external limiting membrane, the ellipsoid zone and interdigitation zone. Underlying diseases included thrombocytopenia and anaemia associated with dengue fever, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, chronic kidney disease and ulcerative colitis, while Valsalva-like manoeuvre was found to be a potential trigger. Other novel associations included the use of lisdexamphetamine. CONCLUSIONS: Classic AMN may be associated with leukaemia, dengue fever, ulcerative colitis and chronic kidney disease, probably as a result of chorioretinal hypoxia in the setting of thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Adrenergic agonists such as lisdexamphetamine may also contribute to the manifestation of AMN.",,,,"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

MDS occurs more frequently in older males and in individuals with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of MDS is based on morphological evidence of dysplasia upon visual examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information obtained from additional studies such as karyotype, flow cytometry, or molecular genetics is complementary but not diagnostic. Risk-stratification: Prognosis of patients with MDS can be calculated using a number of scoring systems. In general, all these scoring systems include analysis of peripheral cytopenias, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, and cytogenetic characteristics. The most commonly used system still is probably the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). IPSS is being replaced by the new revised score IPSS-R. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Therapy is selected based on risk, transfusion needs, percent of bone marrow blasts, and more recently cytogenetic and mutational profiles. Goals of therapy are different in lower risk patients than in higher risk. In lower risk, the goal is to decrease transfusion needs and transformation to higher risk disease or AML, as well as to improve survival. In higher risk, the goal is to prolong survival. Current available therapies include growth factor support, lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, intensive chemotherapy, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The use of lenalidomide has significant clinical activity in patients with lower risk disease, anemia, and a chromosome 5 alteration. 5-Azacitidine and decitabine have activity in higher risk MDS. 5-Azacitidine has been shown to improve survival in higher risk MDS. A number of new molecular lesions have been described in MDS that may serve as new therapeutic targets or aid in the selection of currently available agents. Additional supportive care measures may include the use of prophylactic antibiotics and iron chelation. Management of progressive or refractory disease: At the present time there are no approved interventions for patients with progressive or refractory disease particularly after hypomethylating based therapy. Options include participation in a clinical trial or cytarabine based therapy and stem cell transplantation.",,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying biological effect of PCBP1 in cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), still remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression and clinical outcome of PCBP1in acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Bone marrow fluids of 88 newly diagnosed AML patients were sampled, and the PCBP1 mRNA expression level was evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR. The association between PCBP1 expression and clinicopathological features or the survival status of the patients was assessed by Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Comparing newly diagnosed AML patients to normal healthy donors, PCBP1 expression was significantly decreased in AML patients (P < 0.001). Conversely, PCBP1 expression had accordingly recovered back to normal in patients with complete remission (P < 0.001). Clinical feature analyses showed that PCBP1 expression was negatively correlated with white blood cell count (P = 0.024). In addition, patients with low PCBP1 expression had poor disease-free survival (11.8% vs. 45.3%; P = 0.01) and overall survival (18.2% vs. 42.4%; P = 0.032), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results showed for the first time that expression of PCBP1 was down-regulated in newly diagnosed AML patients and might be an independent prognostic marker in AML and should to be further investigated.",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (PCBP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Diagn Pathol. 2018 Sep 12;13(1):69.

Epub 2015 Aug 21.,"BACKGROUND: Leptin is an adipocytokine produced by adipocytes and controlling body weight. It is unclear whether leptin works as a proinflammatory or an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We investigated the effects of hyperleptinemia on leptin transgenic (LepTg) mice in terms of cartilage destruction, bone destruction, joint synovitis, and serum cytokine levels by using a mouse model of collagen-antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA). METHODS: CAIA was induced for female age-matched 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 J control mice and LepTg mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg of a combination of monoclonal antibody specific for type II collagen on day 0 and 12.5 mg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on day 3. Clinical evaluation of arthritis was monitored for 14 days, and hind paws were examined clinically and histologically. Serum cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were also analyzed on days 0 and 5. Moreover, THP-1 cells, which are human monocytic cell line derived from an acute monocytic leukemia patient, were cultured and differentiated into macrophages. The effects of leptin on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of IL-6 were examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Serum leptin concentrations were approximately ninefold higher in LepTg mice (62.0 +/- 20.7 ng/ml) than in control mice (7.2 +/- 0.5 ng/ml). Severity of clinical paw swelling, arthritis score, synovial hyperplasia, and cartilage damage were suppressed in LepTg mice with CAIA. Although serum cytokine levels of IL-1beta, IL-17, and IL-10 and TNF-alpha showed no significant changes in two mice, serum levels of IL-6 in LepTg mice were suppressed at day 5. Moreover, in vitro study showed that IL-6 elevation following LPS exposure in THP-1 cells was suppressed with high leptin concentrations. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggests that hyperleptinemia suppress IL-6 responses and progression of joint inflammation. Leptin may play an anti-inflammatory role under hyperleptinemia.",,"['0 (Collagen Type II)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leptin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comprehensive systematic review of articles released from 1999 to 2015 (January) was used as a source of scientific evidence. Recommendations were produced using a Delphi process involving a panel of 23 experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet and European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group. Key questions included patient selection, donor selection, pre-transplant management, conditioning regimen, post-transplant management, prevention and management of relapse after transplant. Patients with intermediate-2- or high-risk disease and age <70 years should be considered as candidates for allo-SCT. Patients with intermediate-1-risk disease and age <65 years should be considered as candidates if they present with either refractory, transfusion-dependent anemia, or a percentage of blasts in peripheral blood (PB) >2%, or adverse cytogenetics. Pre-transplant splenectomy should be decided on a case by case basis. Patients with intermediate-2- or high-risk disease lacking an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling or unrelated donor, should be enrolled in a protocol using HLA non-identical donors. PB was considered the most appropriate source of hematopoietic stem cells for HLA-matched sibling and unrelated donor transplants. The optimal intensity of the conditioning regimen still needs to be defined. Strategies such as discontinuation of immune-suppressive drugs, donor lymphocyte infusion or both were deemed appropriate to avoid clinical relapse. In conclusion, we provided consensus-based recommendations aimed to optimize allo-SCT in PMF. Unmet clinical needs were highlighted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated anti-human IL-17A human monoclonal antibody (mAb), AIN457 in MM. We observe significant inhibition of MM cell growth by AIN457 both in the presence and the absence of BM stromal cells (BMSCs). Although IL-17A induces IL-6 production, AIN457 significantly downregulated IL-6 production and MM cell adhesion in MM-BMSC co-culture. AIN457 also significantly inhibited osteoclast cell differentiation. More importantly, in the SCIDhu model of human myeloma administration of AIN457 weekly for 4 weeks after the first detection of tumor in mice led to a significant inhibition of tumor growth and reduced bone damage compared with isotype control mice. To understand the mechanism of action of anti-IL-17A mAb, we report, here, that MM cells express IL-17A. We also observed that IL-17A knockdown inhibited MM cell growth and their ability to induce IL-6 production in co-cultures with BMSC. These pre-clinical observations suggest efficacy of AIN457 in myeloma and provide the rationale for its clinical evaluation for anti-myeloma effects and for improvement of bone disease.","['P50-100707/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01-78378/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01-124929/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01 CA155258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-155258/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (IL17A protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Syndecan-1)', 'DLG4EML025 (secukinumab)']",,,,,['NIHMS707249'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a Cox regression model, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was added as time-dependent variables. There was no difference in probability of relapse between recipients of haploidentical and MSD grafts. Factors of importance for relapse after T-cell-replete grafts included remission status at HSCT, Karnofsky score 80, acute GVHD of grade II or higher and chronic GVHD (P<10(-5)). Patients with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (n=194) had similar outcome as other T-cell-replete haploidentical transplants (n=369). Non-relapse mortality was significantly higher in the haploidentical group compared with that in MSD patients (P<10(-5)). Leukemia-free survival was superior in the MSD patients receiving T-cell-replete (P<10(-5)) or T-cell-depleted grafts (P=0.0006). The risk of relapse was the same in acute leukemia patients who received haploidentical donor grafts as in those given MSD transplants, suggesting a similar GVL effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 15.,"Malignant cells routinely violate cellular checkpoints that should initiate cell death in normal cells by triggering pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. To escape such death inducing signals, cancer cells often select for upregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members including BCL-2, BCL-XL , BFL-1, BCL-W and MCL-1. These family members prevent death by sequestering pro-apoptotic molecules. To counter this resistance mechanism, small molecule inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members have been under development. These molecules have shown promise in pre-clinical and clinical testing to overcome apoptotic resistance, prompting cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Alternatively, other strategies have taken advantage of the normal regulatory machinery controlling anti-apoptotic molecules and have used inhibitors of signaling pathways to down-modulate the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, thus tilting the balance in cancer cells to cell death. This review explores recent developments and strategies aimed at antagonizing anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member action to promote the induction of cell death in cancer therapy.","['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL102175/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL123543/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",,['(c) 2015 FEBS.'],,,['NIHMS733805'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of patients will depend on regular transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBC) during the course of the disease. Particularly patients with MDS and low risk for transformation into acute myeloid leukemia and low risk of early death will receive PRBC transfusions on a regular basis, which puts them at high risk for transfusional iron overload. Transfusion dependence has been associated with negative impact on organ function and reduced life expectancy. Recently, several retrospective but also some prospective studies have indicated, that transfusion dependent patients with MDS might benefit from consequent iron chelation with regard to morbidity and mortality. However, low treatment adherence due to adverse events mainly gastrointestinal in nature is an important obstacle in achieving sufficient iron chelation in MDS patients.

If BM blasts were calculated as a percentage of non-erythroids, 12 (42.9%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for acute erythroleukemia, erythroid/myeloid (AEL). However, none of the patients showed clonal cytogenetic evolution or new mutations. When compared to 47 de novo AEL patients, these 12 patients were less anemic and thrombocytopenic, had less complex karyotypes (p = 0.044) and showed a longer survival, either calculated from diagnosis (p < 0.001) or from the time of AEL (p = 0.005). These findings illustrate that >/= 50% erythroids may appear in BM post-HMA therapy, likely a combination of reduction of BM granulocytes (p < 0.001) and promotion of normal or abnormal erythroid proliferation.

The first asymmetries are introduced when the virus takes a specific route into the nucleus. Next, by co-opting distinct host cofactors, the integration machinery is guided to particular chromatin contexts. As the viral integrase captures a local target nucleosome, specific contacts introduce fine-grained biases in the integration site distribution. In vivo, the established population of proviruses is subject to both positive and negative selection, thereby continuously reshaping the integration site distribution. By affecting stochastic proviral expression as well as the mutagenic potential of the virus, integration site choice may be an inherent part of the evolutionary strategies used by different retroviruses to maximise reproductive success.",['P30 AI027763/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (lens epithelium-derived growth factor)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Patients with higher risk MDS have dismal outcomes and treatment options are very limited. Aside from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, the only potentially curative treatment, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs) are the only intervention that prolongs overall survival in patients with higher risk MDS. The clinical use of DNMTIs in MDS was one of the earliest successful attempts at epigenetic reprogramming of cancer.

Epub 2015 Aug 21.,"While a great deal of progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate retino-tectal mapping, the determinants that target retinal projections to specific layers of the optic tectum remain elusive. Here we show that two independent RGMa-peptides, C- and N-RGMa, activate two distinct intracellular pathways to regulate axonal growth. C-RGMa utilizes a Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG)/Rho/Rock pathway to inhibit axonal growth. N-RGMa on the other hand relies on Upsilon-secretase cleavage of the intracellular portion of Neogenin to generate an intracellular domain (NeICD) that uses LIM-only protein 4 (LMO4) to block growth. In the developing tectum (E18), overexpression of C-RGMa and dominant-negative LARG (LARG-PDZ) induced overshoots in the superficial tectal layer but not in deeper tectal layers. In younger embryos (E12), C-RGMa and LARG-PDZ prevented ectopic projections toward deeper tectal layers, indicating that C-RGMa may act as a barrier to descending axons. In contrast both N-RGMa and NeICD overexpression resulted in aberrant axonal-paths, all of which suggests that it is a repulsive guidance molecule. Thus, two RGMa fragments activate distinct pathways resulting in different axonal responses. These data reveal how retinal projections are targeted to the appropriate layer in their target tissue.",['MOP106666/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3 is a trans-membrane receptor with a tyrosine kinase domain which, when activated, initiates a cascade of phosphorylated proteins including the SRC family of kinases. Recently our group and others have shown that pharmacologic inhibition and genetic knockdown of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) blocks AML blast proliferation, leukaemic cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells as well as migration of AML blasts. The anti-proliferative effects of BTK inhibition in human AML are mediated via inhibition of downstream NF-kappaB pro-survival signalling however the upstream drivers of BTK activation in human AML have yet to be fully characterised. Here we place the FLT3-ITD upstream of BTK in AML and show that the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib inhibits the survival and proliferation of FLT3-ITD primary AML blasts and AML cell lines. Furthermore ibrutinib inhibits the activation of downstream kinases including MAPK, AKT and STAT5. In addition we show that BTK RNAi inhibits proliferation of FLT3-ITD AML cells. Finally we report that ibrutinib reverses the cyto-protective role of BMSC on FLT3-ITD AML survival. These results argue for the evaluation of ibrutinib in patients with FLT3-ITD mutated AML.",['12-0014/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 19.,"Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was used to assess the amount of HTLV-1 provirus DNA integrated into the genomic DNA of host blood cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that a high proviral load is one of the risk factors for the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. However, interlaboratory variability in qPCR results makes it difficult to assess the differences in reported proviral loads between laboratories. To remedy this situation, we attempted to minimize discrepancies between laboratories through standardization of HTLV-1 qPCR in a collaborative study. TL-Om1 cells that harbor the HTLV-1 provirus were serially diluted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells to prepare a candidate standard. By statistically evaluating the proviral loads of the standard and those determined using in-house qPCR methods at each laboratory, we determined the relative ratios of the measured values in the laboratories to the theoretical values of the TL-Om1 standard. The relative ratios of the laboratories ranged from 0.84 to 4.45. Next, we corrected the proviral loads of the clinical samples from HTLV-1 carriers using the relative ratio. As expected, the overall differences between the laboratories were reduced by half, from 7.4-fold to 3.8-fold on average, after applying the correction.

METHODS: Two hundred and seventy consecutive Chinese patients (primary MF, n = 207; post-polycythemia vera MF, n = 27; and post-essential thrombocythemia MF, n = 36) from seven regional referral hospitals were analyzed. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) for primary MF was 66 months. Multivariate analysis showed that age >65 years (P = 0.02), platelet count <100 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.001), and leukemic transformation (P = 0.001) negatively impacted on OS. The median OS of 63 patients with secondary MF was 44 months. In primary MF, the 10-year cumulative risk of leukemic transformation was 28%. On multivariate analysis, unfavorable karyotypes significantly predicted inferior leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.03). In secondary MF, the 10-year cumulative risk of leukemic transformation was 31%. Circulating blasts >/=1% significantly predicted inferior LFS (P = 0.04). The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) and dynamic IPSS were not significant survival predictors in our cohort. Eighteen patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The median OS post-transplantation was merely 19 months. DISCUSSION: Platelet count <100 x 10(9)/l, unfavorable karyotypes, and circulating blasts >1% were negative prognostic indicators. Conclusion Chinese MF patients were similar to Western patients in clinicopathologic features and outcome.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The damage is mediated in part by free radicals, particularly reactive oxygen species. Fermented papaya preparation (FPP), a product of yeast fermentation of Carica papaya Linn, has been shown to act as an antioxidant. In this study, we investigated the potential of FPP to prevent radiation-induced damage. FPP (0-100 mug/ml) was added to cultured human foreskin fibroblasts and myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells either before or after irradiation (0-18 Gy). After 1-3 days, the cells were assayed for: intracellular labile iron, measured by staining with calcein; reactive oxygen species generation, measured with dichlorofluorescein diacetate; apoptosis, determined by phosphatidylserine exposure; membrane damage, determined by propidium iodide uptake; and cell survival, determined by a cell proliferation assay. DNA damage was estimated by measuring 8-oxoguanine, a parameter of DNA oxidation, using a fluorescent-specific probe and by the comet assay. These parameters were also assayed in bone marrow cells of mice treated with FPP (by adding it to the drinking water) either before or after irradiation. Somatic mutation accumulation was determined in their peripheral red blood cells, and their survival was monitored. FPP significantly reduced the measured radiation-induced cytotoxic parameters. These findings suggest that FPP might serve as a radioprotector, and its effect on DNA damage and mutagenicity might reduce the long-term effects of radiation, such as primary and secondary malignancy.",,['0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This region is believed to host multiple tumor suppressors. Chromosome Condensation 1-like (CHC1L) is located at 13q14, and found within the smallest common region of loss of heterozygosity in prostate cancer. Decreased expression of CHC1L is linked to pathogenesis and progression of both prostate cancer and multiple myeloma. However, there is no direct evidence for CHC1L's putative tumor suppressing role in current literature. Presently, we describe the generation and characterization of Chc1L knockout mice. Chc1L-/- mice do not develop cancer at a young age, but bone marrow and spleen cells from 8-12 week-old mice display an exaggerated proliferative response. By approximately two years of age, knockout and heterozygote mice have a markedly increased incidence of tumorigenesis compared to wild-type controls, with tumors occurring mainly in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and intestinal tract. Histopathological analysis found that most heterozygote and knockout mice succumb to either Histiocytic Sarcoma or Histiocyte-Associated Lymphoma. Our study suggests that Chc1L is involved in suppression of these two histiocyte-rich neoplasms in mice and supports clinical data suggesting that CHC1L loss of function is an important step in the pathogenesis of cancers containing 13q14 deletion.",,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Rcc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxicity window of HMC was 6-12 times lower in normal cells as compared to susceptible leukemic HL-60, MOLT-4 and K-562 cells. It persuades apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in above leukemic cell lines, which was evident through Hoechst staining, Annexin-V binding, cell cycle analysis, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), release of cytochrome c, Bax, Bid, over-expression of apical death receptors, activation of caspase-3,-8,-9 and PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) cleavage. HMC induced caspase dependent apoptosis and robustly attenuate transcription factor, p-STAT-3 in myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells. The mechanism of HMC arbitrated inhibition of p-STAT-3 was due to the activation of ubiquitin dependent degradation of p-STAT-3. Therefore, our study not only describes the anti-leukemic potential of HMC but also provides insights into how endophytes can be useful in discovery and development of novel anticancer therapeutics.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, insensitivity of CML stem cells to TKI treatment and intrinsic or acquired resistance are still frequent causes for disease persistence and blastic phase progression experienced in patients after initial successful therapies. Here, we investigated a possible role for the MAPK15/ERK8 kinase in BCR-ABL1-dependent autophagy, a key process for oncogene-induced leukemogenesis. In this context, we showed the ability of MAPK15 to physically recruit the oncogene to autophagic vesicles, confirming our hypothesis of a biologically relevant role for this MAP kinase in signal transduction by this oncogene. Indeed, by modeling BCR-ABL1 signaling in HeLa cells and taking advantage of a physiologically relevant model for human CML, i.e. K562 cells, we demonstrated that BCR-ABL1-induced autophagy is mediated by MAPK15 through its ability to interact with LC3-family proteins, in a LIR-dependent manner. Interestingly, we were also able to interfere with BCR-ABL1-induced autophagy by a pharmacological approach aimed at inhibiting MAPK15, opening the possibility of acting on this kinase to affect autophagy and diseases depending on this cellular function. Indeed, to support the feasibility of this approach, we demonstrated that depletion of endogenous MAPK15 expression inhibited BCR-ABL1-dependent cell proliferation, in vitro, and tumor formation, in vivo, therefore providing a novel ""druggable"" link between BCR-ABL1 and human CML.",,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK15 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively identified 95 patients with CLL, also diagnosed with AL (n=38) or MDS (n=57), either concurrently (n=5) or subsequent (n=90) to CLL diagnosis and report their outcomes. Median number of CLL treatments prior to AL and MDS was 2 (0-9) and 1 (0-8), respectively; the most common regimen was purine analog combined with alkylating agent+/-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Twelve cases had no prior CLL treatment. Among 38 cases with AL, 33 had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 3 had acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL; 1 Philadelphia chromosome positive), 1 had biphenotypic and 1 had extramedullary (bladder) AML. Unfavorable AML karyotype was noted in 26, and intermediate risk in 7 patients. There was no association between survival from AL and number of prior CLL regimens or karyotype. Expression of CD7 on blasts was associated with shorter survival. Among MDS cases, all International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) were represented; karyotype was unfavorable in 36, intermediate in 6 and favorable in 12 patients; 10 experienced transformation to AML. Shorter survival from MDS correlated with higher risk IPSS, poor-risk karyotype and increased number of prior CLL treatments. Overall, outcomes for patients with CLL subsequently diagnosed with AL or MDS were very poor; AL/MDS occurred without prior CLL treatment. Effective therapies for these patients are desperately needed.","['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NIHMS765849'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 19.,"Current therapies for treatment of myeloid leukemia do not eliminate leukemia stem cells (LSC), leading to disease relapse. In this study, we supplemented mice with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5), a polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid, at pharmacologic levels, to examine whether the endogenous metabolite, cyclopentenone prostaglandin delta-12 PGJ3 (Delta(12)-PGJ3), was effective in targeting LSCs in experimental leukemia. EPA supplementation for 8 weeks resulted in enhanced endogenous production of Delta(12)-PGJ3 that was blocked by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. Using a murine model of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) induced by bone marrow transplantation of BCR-ABL-expressing hematopoietic stem cells, mice supplemented with EPA showed a decrease in the LSC population, and reduced splenomegaly and leukocytosis, when compared with mice on an oleic acid diet. Supplementation of CML mice carrying the T315I mutation (in BCR-ABL) with EPA resulted in a similar effect. Indomethacin blocked the EPA effect and increased the severity of BCR-ABL-induced CML and decreased apoptosis. Delta(12)-PGJ3 rescued indomethacin-treated BCR-ABL mice and decreased LSCs. Inhibition of hematopoietic-prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS) by HQL-79 in EPA-supplemented CML mice also blocked the effect of EPA. In addition, EPA supplementation was effective in a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia. EPA-supplemented mice exhibited a decrease in leukemia burden and a decrease in the LSC colony-forming unit (LSC-CFU). The decrease in LSCs was confirmed through serial transplantation assays in all disease models. The results support a chemopreventive role for EPA in myeloid leukemia, which is dependent on the ability to efficiently convert EPA to endogenous COX-derived prostanoids, including Delta(12)-PGJ3.","['TL1 TR000125/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH UL1 TR000127/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 175576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000127/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA175576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['NIHMS717400'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 60 % of mutations in this gene have been identified in the arginine codon R882. To date, there is no consensus on whether these mutations can be used as biomarkers for monitoring of minimal residual disease and management of preemptive AML therapy. We studied the occurrence of mutations in the DNMT3A gene in our cohort of patients and their persistence during AML treatment.

Mutation R882C was detected in 5/11, R882H in 4/11 patients, and Y735S and L347P in one patient each. In 4/7 patients initially carrying mutations in the R882 codon, we found the persistence of mutations also during complete remission with, however, no correlation to AML kinetics. Our findings suggest that mutations in the DNMT3A gene can only be used as a biomarker for those AML patients in whom DNMT3A mutation is lost after therapy.",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 20.,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most aggressive malignancy in thyroid cancers. Resistance to current therapies is still a challenge. MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs, regulating gene expression. MiR-21 is an oncomiR that is overexpressed in nearly all cancers including ATC. Accumulating evidence suggested that miR-21 has a role in cancer stemness state, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and differentiation. Therefore, we evaluated the application of Off-miR-21 to sequester the microRNA for therapeutic purposes on ATC cell lines. In this study, C643 and SW1736 were transducted by hsa-miR-21 antagomir (Off-miR-21). PTEN gene expression was performed as a known target of miR-21. Stemness state in cancer stem cells (CSCs) was evaluated by the changes of CSC biomarkers including Oct-4 and ABCG2. Apoptosis was assessed by PDCD4 and Mcl-1 gene expression and flow cytometry. Sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) and thyroglobulin (TG) were measured as ATC differentiation markers. In addition, cell cycle progression was investigated via the alterations of p21 gene expression and flow cytometry. Specific downregulation of miR-21 induced the differentiation and apoptosis in C643 and SW1736. Inversely, the treatment inhibited stemness state and cell cycle progression. Knockdown of miR-21 significantly increased the expression of PDCD4, p21, NIS, and TG while leading to decreased expression of Oct-4, ABCG2, and Mcl-1.Taken together, the results suggest that miR-21, as an oncomiR, has a role not only in stemness state but also in tumor growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Hence, suppression of miR-21 could pave the way for ATC therapy.",,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PDCD4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about how survival signalling is regulated in CML stem cells. In this study, we survey global metabolic differences between murine normal haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and CML stem cells using metabolomics techniques. Strikingly, we show that CML stem cells accumulate significantly higher levels of certain dipeptide species than normal HSCs. Once internalized, these dipeptide species activate amino-acid signalling via a pathway involving p38MAPK and the stemness transcription factor Smad3, which promotes CML stem cell maintenance. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of dipeptide uptake inhibits CML stem cell activity in vivo. Our results demonstrate that dipeptide species support CML stem cell maintenance by activating p38MAPK-Smad3 signalling in vivo, and thus point towards a potential therapeutic target for CML treatment.",,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (hydrogen-coupled oligopeptide transporter PepT2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are no therapies to prevent ATL development in high-risk asymptomatic carriers. To develop a therapy targeting HTLV-1-infected cells that are known to express CCR4 frequently, we tested whether truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38) fused to a CCR4 ligand, CCL17/thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), selectively eliminates such cells. RESULTS: Our data show that TARC-PE38 efficiently killed HTLV-1-infected cell lines. It also shrank HTLV-1-associated solid tumors in an infected-cell-engrafted mouse model. In HTLV-1-positive humanized mice, TARC-PE38 markedly inhibited the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected human CD4(+)CD25(+) or CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+) cells and reduced the proviral loads (PVLs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Importantly, TARC-PE38 significantly reduced the PVLs in PBMCs obtained from asymptomatic carriers. We show that the cytotoxicity of TARC-PE38 is mediated by the expression of the proprotein convertase, furin. The expression of furin was enhanced in HTLV-1-infected cells and correlated positively with PVLs in HTLV-1-infected individuals, suggesting that infected cells are more susceptible to TARC-PE38 than normal cells. CONCLUSIONS: TARC-PE38 robustly controls HTLV-1 infection by eliminating infected cells in both a CCR4- and furin-dependent manner, indicating the excellent therapeutic potential of TARC-PE38.",,"['0 (Chemokine CCL17)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TARC-PE38 fusion protein)', 'EC 3.4.21.75 (Furin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 20.,"It is well established that natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the immunity against cancer, while the involvement of other recently identified, NK-related innate lymphoid cells is still poorly defined. In the haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the therapy of high-risk leukemias, NK cells have been shown to exert a key role in killing leukemic blasts residual after conditioning. While the clinical results in the cure of leukemias are excellent, the exploitation of NK cells in the therapy of solid tumors is still limited and unsatisfactory. In solid tumors, NK cell function may be inhibited via different mechanisms, occurring primarily at the tumor site. The cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment involve tumor cells, stromal cells and resident or recruited leukocytes and may favor tumor evasion from the host's defenses. In this context, a number of cytokines, growth factors and enzymes synthesized by tumor cells, stromal cells, suppressive/regulatory myeloid and lymphoid cells may substantially impair the function of different tumor-reactive effector cells, including NK cells. The identification and characterization of such mechanisms may offer clues for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies to restore effective anti-tumor responses. In order to harness NK cell-based immunotherapies, several approaches have been proposed, including reinforcement of NK cell cytotoxicity by means of specific cytokines, antibodies or drugs. These new tools may improve NK cell function and/or increase tumor susceptibility to NK-mediated killing. Hence, the integration of NK-based immunotherapies with conventional anti-tumor therapies may increase chances of successful cancer treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a 43-gene CD22DeltaE12 signature transcriptome that shows a striking representation in primary human leukemia cells from patients with relapsed BPL. Our data uniquely indicate that CD22DeltaE12 is a candidate driver lesion responsible for the activation of MAPK and PI3-K pathways in aggressive forms of B-lineage ALL. We also show that the forced expression of a CD22 RNA trans-splicing molecule (RTM) markedly reduces the capacity of the leukemic stem cell fraction of CD22DeltaE12(+) B-lineage ALL cells to engraft and cause overt leukemia in NOD/SCID mice. We have successfully complexed our rationally designed lead CD22-RTM with PVBLG-8 to prepare a non-viral nanoscale formulation of CD22DeltaE12-RTM with potent anti-cancer activity against CD22DeltaE12(+) B-lineage leukemia and lymphoma cells.

We hypothesized that EBV microRNAs contribute to progression of CLL and demonstrated the presence of EBV miRNAs in B-cells, in paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies and in the plasma of patients with CLL by using three different methods (small RNA-sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription PCR [q-RT-PCR] and miRNAs in situ hybridization [miRNA-ISH]). We found that EBV miRNA BHRF1-1 expression levels were significantly higher in the plasma of patients with CLL compared with healthy individuals (p < 0 . 0001). Notably, BHRF1-1 as well as BART4 expression were detected in the plasma of either seronegative or seropositive (anti-EBNA-1 IgG and EBV DNA tested) patients; similarly, miRNA-ISH stained positive in bone marrow specimens while LMP1 and EBER immunohistochemistry failed to detect viral proteins and RNA. We also found that BHRF1-1 plasma expression levels were positively associated with elevated beta-2-microglobulin levels and advanced Rai stages and observed a correlation between higher BHRF1-1 expression levels and shorter survival in two independent patients' cohorts. Furthermore, in the majority of CLL cases where BHRF1-1 was exogenously induced in primary malignant B cells the levels of TP53 were reduced. Our findings suggest that EBV may have a role in the process of disease progression in CLL and that miRNA RT-PCR and miRNAs ISH could represent additional methods to detect EBV miRNAs in patients with CLL.","['UH2 TR000943/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA127001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA093459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (BHRF1 protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 1)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'O5GA75RST7 (EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1)']",['EBioMedicine. 2015 Jun;2(6):489-90.

DISCUSSION: Graft versus host disease occurs in 30-50% of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients and may cause pharmacoresistant myoclonic epilepsy; however, the mechanisms by which GVHD leads to recurrent myoclonic seizures are not well understood (Lee, 2005) [1].

Until recently, most studies in CLL focused on younger patients in whom intensive therapy with the addition of rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was shown to improve survival. Obinutuzumab is a novel type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recently demonstrated an overall survival advantage when combined with chemotherapy in previously untreated older patients with CLL and comorbidities. Obinutuzumab was superior to rituximab in this same study in terms of response rates and progression-free survival. Several preclinical and early phase clinical studies also support the efficacy of obinutuzumab. The most frequent adverse event noted with obinutuzumab is infusion-related reactions, which occur more frequently than with rituximab and are typically restricted to the first cycle of therapy. Based on these results, obinutuzumab should be considered the gold standard mAb for combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with CLL and comorbidities. The marked efficacy of obinutuzumab with a weak chemotherapy backbone implies significant potency of this mAb, making it the ideal partner for combination studies with other agents in CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, the aim of our study was to find new genes as targets using in silico studies; for this we retrieved the top 10% overexpressed genes from Oncomine public domain microarray expression database; 530 overexpressed genes were short-listed from Oncomine database. Then, using prioritization tools such as ENDEAVOUR, DIR and TOPPGene online tools, we found fifty-four genes common to the three prioritization tools which formed our candidate leukemogenic genes for this study. As per the protocol we selected thirty training genes from PubMed. The prioritized and training genes were then used to construct STRING functional association network, which was further analyzed using cytoHubba hub analysis tool to investigate new genes which could form drug targets in leukemia. Analysis of the STRING protein network built from these prioritized and training genes led to identification of two hub genes, SMAD2 and CDK9, which were not implicated in leukemogenesis earlier. Filtering out from several hundred genes in the network we also found MEN1, HDAC1 and LCK genes, which re-emphasized the important role of these genes in leukemogenesis. This is the first report on these five additional signature genes in leukemogenesis. We propose these as new targets for developing novel therapeutics and also as biomarkers in leukemogenesis, which could be important for prognosis and diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of scientific research on wheatgrass establishes its anticancer and antioxidant potential. Current work was focused to determine antileukemic effect of wheat grass. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The commercial wheatgrass powder was extracted with 95% of methanol. Methanol extract of wheat grass was studied for acute oral toxicity as per revised Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines number 423. Leukemia was successfully induced in Wister rats by intravenous injection of benzene. The blood was collected and analyzed for hematological parameters. Phagocytotic activity of the extract was determined. RESULTS: Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenolics, carbohydrates, and amino acids. From acute toxicity studies, it was found that the methanol extract of wheatgrass was safe up to a dose level of 2000 mg/kg of body weight. Outcomes of hematological parameters in various experimental groups of murine model demonstrated antileukemic effect of extract. Methanol extract of wheatgrass aroused the process of phagocytosis of killed Candida albicans and also demonstrated a significant chemotactic activity at all tested concentrations. CONCLUSION: In the current work, methanol extract of wheat grass demonstrated antileukemic potential that might be due to the presence of flavonoids and polyphenolics in it.

Given the very high-curability rate of trophoblastic disease, the risk of further molar pregnancy after CHM or PHM as well as the risk of second primary tumors and fertility compromise after chemotherapy for GTN represent major concerns. The incidence of subsequent molar pregnancy ranges from 0.7 to 2.6% after one CHM or PHM, and is approximately 10% after two previous CHMs. Among patients who have received chemotherapy, there is an increased risk of myeloid leukemia which is mainly related to the cumulative dose of etoposide. Resumption of normal menses occurs in approximately 95% of women treated with chemotherapy, but menopause occurs 3 years earlier compared with those non-treated with chemotherapy. Term live birth rates higher than 70% without increased risk of congenital abnormalities have been reported in these women, and pregnancy outcomes are comparable to those of general population, except a slightly increased risk of stillbirth.

Epub 2015 Sep 6.,"Multipolar interactions involving fluorine and the protein backbone have been frequently observed in protein-ligand complexes. Such fluorine-backbone interactions may substantially contribute to the high affinity of small molecule inhibitors. Here we found that introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into two different sites in the thienopyrimidine class of menin-MLL inhibitors considerably improved their inhibitory activity. In both cases, trifluoromethyl groups are engaged in short interactions with the backbone of menin. In order to understand the effect of fluorine, we synthesized a series of analogues by systematically changing the number of fluorine atoms, and we determined high-resolution crystal structures of the complexes with menin. We found that introduction of fluorine at favorable geometry for interactions with backbone carbonyls may improve the activity of menin-MLL inhibitors as much as 5- to 10-fold. In order to facilitate the design of multipolar fluorine-backbone interactions in protein-ligand complexes, we developed a computational algorithm named FMAP, which calculates fluorophilic sites in proximity to the protein backbone. We demonstrated that FMAP could be used to rationalize improvement in the activity of known protein inhibitors upon introduction of fluorine. Furthermore, FMAP may also represent a valuable tool for designing new fluorine substitutions and support ligand optimization in drug discovery projects.

By contrast, mouse PSCs have been classified as naive PSCs that can contribute to most of the tissues of chimeras, including germ cells. Here, we describe the generation of two different types of bovine induced pluripotent stem cells (biPSCs) from amnion cells, achieved through introduction of piggyBac vectors containing doxycycline-inducible transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). One type of biPSCs, cultured in medium supplemented with knockout serum replacement (KSR), FGF2, and bovine leukemia inhibitory factor (bLIF), had a flattened morphology like human PSCs; these were classified as primed-type. The other type biPSCs, cultured in KSR, bLIF, Mek/Erk inhibitor, GSK3 inhibitor and forskolin, had a compact morphology like mouse PSCs; these were classified as naive-type. Cells could easily be switched between these two types of biPSCs by changing the culture conditions. Both types of biPSCs had strong alkaline phosphatase activity, expressed pluripotent markers (OCT3/4, NANOG, REX1, ESRRbeta, STELLA, and SOCS3), and formed embryoid bodies that gave rise to differentiated cells from all three embryonic germ layers. However, only naive-type biPSCs showed the hallmarks of naive mouse PSCs, such as LIF-dependent proliferation, lack of FGF5 expression, and active XIST expression with two active X chromosomes. Furthermore, naive-type biPSCs could contribute to the inner cell mass (ICM) of host blastocysts and most tissues within chimeric embryos. This is the first report of generation of biPSCs with several characteristics similar to those of naive mouse PSCs and a demonstrated potential to contribute to chimeras.",,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was previously reported that, in patient-derived HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells, retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation is driven by a signalsome containing c-Cbl and AhR. FICZ enhances RA-induced differentiation, assessed by expression of the membrane differentiation markers CD38 and CD11b, cell cycle arrest and the functional differentiation marker, inducible oxidative metabolism. Moreover, FICZ augments the expression of a number of the members of the RA-induced signalsome, such as c-Cbl, Vav1, Slp76, PI3K, and the Src family kinases Fgr and Lyn. Pursuing the molecular signaling responsible for RA-induced differentiation, we characterized, using FRET and clustering analysis, associations of key molecules thought to drive differentiation. Here we report that, assayed by FRET, AhR interacts with c-Cbl upon FICZ plus RA-induced differentiation, whereas AhR constitutively interacts with Cbl-b. Moreover, correlation analysis based on the flow cytometric assessment of differentiation markers and western blot detection of signaling factors reveal that Cbl-b, p-p38alpha and pT390-GSK3beta, are not correlated with other known RA-induced signaling components or with a phenotypic outcome. We note that FICZ plus RA elicited signaling responses that were not typical of RA alone, but may represent alternative differentiation-driving pathways. In clusters of signaling molecules seminal to cell differentiation, FICZ co-administered with RA augments type and intensity of the dynamic changes induced by RA. Our data suggest relevance for FICZ in differentiation-induction therapy. The mechanism of action includes modulation of a SFK and MAPK centered signalsome and c-Cbl-AhR association.","['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '3U54CA143876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 19.,"Epigenetic modifiers have fundamental roles in defining unique cellular identity through the establishment and maintenance of lineage-specific chromatin and methylation status. Several DNA modifications such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are catalysed by the ten eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine dioxygenase family members, and the roles of Tet proteins in regulating chromatin architecture and gene transcription independently of DNA methylation have been gradually uncovered. However, the regulation of immunity and inflammation by Tet proteins independent of their role in modulating DNA methylation remains largely unknown. Here we show that Tet2 selectively mediates active repression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) transcription during inflammation resolution in innate myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages. Loss of Tet2 resulted in the upregulation of several inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, at late phase during the response to lipopolysaccharide challenge. Tet2-deficient mice were more susceptible to endotoxin shock and dextran-sulfate-sodium-induced colitis, displaying a more severe inflammatory phenotype and increased IL-6 production compared to wild-type mice. IkappaBzeta, an IL-6-specific transcription factor, mediated specific targeting of Tet2 to the Il6 promoter, further indicating opposite regulatory roles of IkappaBzeta at initial and resolution phases of inflammation. For the repression mechanism, independent of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, Tet2 recruited Hdac2 and repressed transcription of Il6 via histone deacetylation. We provide mechanistic evidence for the gene-specific transcription repression activity of Tet2 via histone deacetylation and for the prevention of constant transcription activation at the chromatin level for resolving inflammation.","['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (IkappaBeta protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)']",['Nat Rev Immunol. 2015 Oct;15(10):598.

METHODS: Eighty-seven children diagnosed with B-ALL between January 2014 and September 2014 were enrolled, and 20 hospitalized children who had no tumor or blood disease and had normal bone marrow cell morphology served as the control group. The expression features of CD58 in bone marrow samples from the two groups (at diagnosis, on day 15 of induction chemotherapy) were analyzed by four-color flow cytometry (FCM). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and FCM were used to detect MRD in B-ALL patients on day 33 of induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: The mean fluorescence intensity of CD58 expression in the 87 B-ALL cases (91+/-33) was significantly higher than that in the 20 controls (14+/-6) (P<0.01); CD58 was over-expressed in 44 of the B-ALL cases. In the B-ALL children, the expression of CD58 on day 15 of induction chemotherapy (105+/-22) was not significantly different from that at diagnosis (107+/-26) (P>0.05). In the 44 B-ALL patients with CD58 over-expression, FCM showed 9 MRD(+) cases and 35 MRD(-) cases, while qRT-PCR showed 11 MRD(+) cases and 33 MRD(-) cases; 42 cases (95%) showed consistent results of the two tests, so there was no significant difference between the two methods in detecting MRD (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CD58 is over-expressed and stable in children with B-ALL, and it can be considered as an indicator for MRD detection in childhood B-ALL.",,['0 (CD58 Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among several new inhibitors of this type exhibiting Class I selectivity and potent inhibition of HDAC3-NCoR2, in vitro assays for the inhibition of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3-NCoR2 by N-(2-aminophenyl)-benzamide 15k gave respective IC50 values of 80, 110, and 6 nM.

Flow cytometry is an essential tool to confirm diagnosis and evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD). This study aims at identifying new surface PC markers suitable for targeted therapy in MM and able to improve MRD detection. METHODS: The expression of 82 molecules provided by the ""Ninth International Workshop on Leukocyte Antigens"" was analyzed by flow cytometry in 5 MM cell lines and in 20 newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients. Based on the antigens expression and monoclonal antibody availability, CD150, CD48, CD229, CD352, CD319, CD272, CD86, CD200 and CD184 were subsequently tested in 24 NDMM, 8 relapsed MM (RMM), 6 plasma cell leukemia (PCL) and 13 healthy subjects. RESULTS: CD352 was less frequently expressed on NDMM than on healthy PCs; CD200 was more frequently expressed on NDMM than on RMM and healthy PCs. CD150, CD319, CD229, CD352 Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) was lower in pathological than in healthy samples. The proportion of CD150-positive samples was lower in NDMM and RMM than in healthy subjects; CD86+ samples were less frequent in NDMM than in healthy subjects; CD200+ samples were more frequent in NDMM than in RMM and healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: CD150, CD86 and CD200 can help to identify malignant PCs; CD272, CD319, CD229, CD48 are highly expressed on all PCs and could be considered for targeted therapy.

We found that treatment with 1.5 mug/mL DHTS increased proapoptotic Bax and Bad protein expressions and activated caspases-3, -8, and -9, thus leading to poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and resulting in cell apoptosis. DHTS induced sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and Fas ligand (FasL) expression. The anti-Fas blocking antibody reversed the DHTS-induced cell death, and the JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, inhibited DHTS-induced caspase-3, -8, -9, and PARP cleavage.

The main epigenetic hallmarks of the cancer cell are DNA methylation and histone modifications. Proteins such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) that cause modifications of histones and other proteins can be targets for novel anticancer agents. Recently, interest in compounds that can inhibit HDACs increased, and now there are many HDACs inhibitors (HDACIs) available with different chemical structures, biological and biochemical properties; hopefully some of them will succeed, probably in combination with other agents, in cancer therapies. In our study we focused on the novel HDACI-BML-210. We found that BML-210 (N-phenyl-N'-(2-Aminophenyl)hexamethylenediamide) inhibits the growth of NB4 cells in dose- and time-dependent manner. In this study we also examined how expression and activity of HDACs are affected after leukemia cell treatment with BML-210. Using a mass spectrometry method we identified proteins that changed expression after treatment with BML-210. We prepared RT-PCR analysis of these genes and the results correlated with proteomic data. Based on these and other findings from our group, we suggest that HDACIs, like BML-210, can be promising anticancer agents in promyelocytic leukemia treatment.",,"['0 (Anilides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (N1-(2-aminophenyl)-N8-phenyloctanediamide)', '0 (Proteome)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we examined whether social environment affects expression of a stress-related gene expression profile known as the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), which involves upregulation of proinflammatory genes and downregulation of genes involved in type I IFN response and antibody synthesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared pretransplant leukocyte CTRA gene expression between a group of 78 high versus low SES recipients of unrelated donor HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia in first remission. Post hoc exploratory analyses also evaluated whether CTRA gene expression was associated with poor clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected pre-HCT from low SES individuals demonstrated significant CTRA upregulation compared with matched HCT recipients of high SES. Promoter-based bioinformatics implicated distinct patterns of transcription factor activity, including increased CREB signaling and decreased IRF and GR signaling. High expression of the CTRA gene profile was also associated with increased relapse risk and decreased leukemia-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Low SES is associated with increased expression of the CTRA gene profile, and CTRA gene expression is associated with adverse HCT clinical outcomes. These findings provide a biologic framework within which to understand how social environmental conditions may influence immune function and clinical outcomes in allogeneic HCT.","['U10 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5U24-CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSH250201200016C/PHS HHS/United States', '5U10HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG017265/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 AG048681/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,['Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Jan 1;22(1):6-8.

In addition to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, therapeutic strategies that modulate the expression of FLT3-ITD are also promising. We show that AML samples bearing FLT3-ITD mutations are more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than wild-type samples and this sensitivity is strongly correlated with a higher FLT3-ITD allelic burden. Using pharmacologic inhibitors of autophagy, specific downregulation of key autophagy proteins including Vps34, autophagy gene (Atg)5, Atg12, Atg13, biochemical, and microscopy studies, we demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors induced cytotoxic autophagy in AML cells. FLT3-ITD molecules were detectable within autophagosomes after bortezomib treatment indicating that autophagy induction was responsible for the early degradation of FLT3-ITD, which preceded the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), PI3K/AKT, and STAT5 pathways, and subsequent activation of cell death. Moreover, proteasome inhibitors overcome resistance to quizartinib induced by mutations in the kinase domain of FLT3, suggesting that these compounds may prevent the emergence of mutant clones arising from tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments. In xenograft mice models, bortezomib stimulated the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicating induction of autophagy in vivo, downregulated FLT3-ITD protein expression and improved overall survival.

These effects impact on their use in allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation and other forms of transplantation. Interventions that target activated dendritic cells (DCs) have the potential to suppress the induction of undesired immune responses (for example, graft versus host disease (GVHD) or transplant rejection) and to leave protective T-cell immune responses intact (for example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunity). We developed a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), 3C12, specific for CD83, which is expressed on activated but not resting DC. The 3C12 mAb and an affinity improved version, 3C12C, depleted CD83(+) cells by CD16(+) NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and inhibited allogeneic T-cell proliferation in vitro. A single dose of 3C12C prevented human peripheral blood mononuclear cell-induced acute GVHD in SCID mouse recipients. The mAb 3C12C depleted CMRF-44(+)CD83(bright) activated DC but spared CD83(dim/-) DC in vivo. It reduced human T-cell activation in vivo and maintained the proportion of CD4(+) FoxP3(+) CD25(+) Treg cells and also viral-specific CD8(+) T cells. The anti-CD83 mAb, 3C12C, merits further evaluation as a new immunosuppressive agent in transplantation.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently identified a novel p62-ZZ inhibitor, XRK3F2, which inhibits MM cell growth and BMSC growth enhancement of human MM cells. In the current study, we evaluate the relative specificity of XRK3F2 for p62-ZZ, characterize XRK3F2's capacity to inhibit growth of primary MM cells and human MM cell lines, and test the in vivo effects of XRK3F2 in the immunocompetent 5TGM1 MM model. We found that XRK3F2 induces dramatic cortical bone formation that is restricted to MM containing bones and blocked the effects and upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), an osteoblast (OB) differentiation inhibitor that is increased in the MM bone marrow microenvironment and utilizes signaling complexes formed on p62-ZZ, in BMSC. Interestingly, XRK3F2 had no effect on non-MM bearing bone. These results demonstrate that targeting p62 in MM models has profound effects on MMBD.","['5R01 AR059679-05/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA141426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21HL109654/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA047904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DA025612/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA141426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA025612/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL109654/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 CX000623/CX/CSRD VA/United States', 'R21 CA179017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R21CA179017-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR059679/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (SQSTM1 protein, human)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,['NIHMS711290'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, no optimal salvage strategy exists for responding patients, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative option in this setting; however, the vast majority of elderly patients are not candidates for this procedure due to poor functional status secondary to age and age-related comorbidities. Furthermore, the lack of effective salvage programs available for elderly patients with recurrent AML underscores the need for therapies that consistently yield durable remissions or durable control of their disease.

10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.04.006. eCollection 2015 Jun.,"BACKGROUND: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a model for synergistic target cancer therapy using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), which yields a very high 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 85 to 90%. Nevertheless, about 15% of APL patients still get early death or relapse. We performed this study to address the possible impact of additional gene mutations on the outcome of APL. METHODS: We included a consecutive series of 266 cases as training group, and then validated the results in a testing group of 269 patients to investigate the potential prognostic gene mutations, including FLT3-ITD or -TKD, N-RAS, C-KIT, NPM1, CEPBA, WT1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, MLL (fusions and PTD), IDH1, IDH2 and TET2. RESULTS: More high-risk patients (50.4%) carried additional mutations, as compared with intermediate- and low-risk ones. The mutations of epigenetic modifier genes were associated with poor prognosis in terms of disease-free survival in both training (HR = 6.761, 95% CI 2.179-20.984; P = 0.001) and validation (HR = 4.026, 95% CI 1.089-14.878; P = 0.037) groups. Sanz risk stratification was associated with CR induction and OS. CONCLUSION: In an era of ATRA/ATO treatment, both molecular markers and clinical parameter based stratification systems should be used as prognostic factors for APL.",,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",['EBioMedicine. 2015 Jun;2(6):487-8.

Participants were 73 parents of children aged 2-6 years. The children were either a) receiving treatment for ALL (n = 43), or b) had no major medical history (n = 30). Participants completed psychometrically validated questionnaires that assessed parenting behaviors and child diet. Increased parental overprotection was associated with higher fruit and vegetable consumption for the control group but lower fruit and vegetable consumption for the ALL group. Parental overprotection, inconsistent discipline and emotional feeding were positively associated with non-core (""junk"") food consumption for the ALL group, particularly those who had recently received steroid treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that certain parenting behaviors may be associated with poor nutrition during treatment for ALL. In light of these results, parenting interventions, specifically targeting parenting behaviors such as assertive discipline, may be a mechanism for nutrition promotion amongst this vulnerable group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients, aged 10 and 14, remained of uncertain genetic diagnosis until whole genome sequencing was pursued. Genome sequencing identified a novel homozygous C65S mutation in the LIFR gene that is predicted to markedly destabilize and alter the structure of a particular domain and consequently to affect the functionality of the whole multi-domain LIFR protein. The C65S mutant LIFR showed altered glycosylation and an elevated expression level that might be attributed to a slow turnover of the mutant form. LIFR mutations have been reported in Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS), a severe autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia often resulting in early death. Our patients share some clinical features of rare cases of SWS long-term survivors; however, they also phenocopy HSAN due to the marked pain insensitivity phenotype and progressive bone destruction. Screening for LIFR mutations might be warranted in genetically unresolved HSAN phenotypes.",,"['0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)']",,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2015 Aug 18.,"UNLABELLED: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been investigated as a treatment for various inflammatory diseases because of their immunomodulatory and reparative properties. However, many basic questions concerning their mechanisms of action after systemic infusion remain unanswered. We performed a detailed analysis of the immunomodulatory properties and proteomic profile of MSCs systemically administered to two patients with severe refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on a compassionate use basis and attempted to correlate these with in vivo anti-inflammatory actions. Both patients received 2x10(6) cells per kilogram, and each subsequently improved with resolution of respiratory, hemodynamic, and multiorgan failure. In parallel, a decrease was seen in multiple pulmonary and systemic markers of inflammation, including epithelial apoptosis, alveolar-capillary fluid leakage, and proinflammatory cytokines, microRNAs, and chemokines. In vitro studies of the MSCs demonstrated a broad anti-inflammatory capacity, including suppression of T-cell responses and induction of regulatory phenotypes in T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Some of these in vitro potency assessments correlated with, and were relevant to, the observed in vivo actions. These experiences highlight both the mechanistic information that can be gained from clinical experience and the value of correlating in vitro potency assessments with clinical effects. The findings also suggest, but do not prove, a beneficial effect of lung protective strategies using adoptively transferred MSCs in ARDS. Appropriate randomized clinical trials are required to further assess any potential clinical efficacy and investigate the effects on in vivo inflammation. SIGNIFICANCE: This article describes the cases of two patients with severe refractory adult respiratory syndrome (ARDS) who failed to improve after both standard life support measures, including mechanical ventilation, and additional measures, including extracorporeal ventilation (i.e., in a heart-lung machine). Unlike acute forms of ARDS (such in the current NIH-sponsored study of mesenchymal stromal cells in ARDS), recovery does not generally occur in such patients.",,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proteome)']",,['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],,,,['Stem Cells Transl Med. 2016 Jun;5(6):845.

These activities of Tax have been implicated in the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) in HTLV-1-infected individuals, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. IKK and its upstream kinase, TGFbeta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), contain ubiquitin-binding subunits, NEMO and TAB2/3 respectively, which interact with K63-linked polyubiquitin (K63-pUb) chains. Recruitment to K63-pUb allows cross auto-phosphorylation and activation of TAK1 to occur, followed by TAK1-catalyzed IKK phosphorylation and activation. Using cytosolic extracts of HeLa and Jurkat T cells supplemented with purified proteins we have identified ubiquitin E3 ligase, ring finger protein 8 (RNF8), and E2 conjugating enzymes, Ubc13:Uev1A and Ubc13:Uev2, to be the cellular factors utilized by Tax for TAK1 and IKK activation. In vitro, the combination of Tax and RNF8 greatly stimulated TAK1, IKK, IkappaBalpha and JNK phosphorylation. In vivo, RNF8 over-expression augmented while RNF8 ablation drastically reduced canonical NF-kappaB activation by Tax. Activation of the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway by Tax, however, is unaffected by the loss of RNF8. Using purified components, we further demonstrated biochemically that Tax greatly stimulated RNF8 and Ubc13:Uev1A/Uev2 to assemble long K63-pUb chains. Finally, co-transfection of Tax with increasing amounts of RNF8 greatly induced K63-pUb assembly in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, Tax targets RNF8 and Ubc13:Uev1A/Uev2 to promote the assembly of K63-pUb chains, which signal the activation of TAK1 and multiple downstream kinases including IKK and JNK. Because of the roles RNF8 and K63-pUb chains play in DNA damage repair and cytokinesis, this mechanism may also explain the genomic instability of HTLV-1-transformed T cells and ATL cells.","['R01 CA076595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM109887/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA140963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNF8 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we look for evidence at the clonal level that polyreactive antibodies cross-reactive to apoptotic cells and multiple autoantigens can also react to HLA and contribute to the overall serum reactivity. METHODS: We immortalized B cell clones from the blood of 2 kidney transplant recipients and characterized their reactivity to self-antigens, apoptotic cells as well as native, denatured, and cryptic HLA determinants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and Luminex assays. We also assessed the reactivity of 300 pretransplant serum specimens to HLA and apoptotic cells. RESULTS: We report here 4 distinct B cell clones cross-reactive to self and HLA class I. All 4 clones reacted to numerous HLA class I alleles but did not appear to target canonical ""shared"" epitopes. In parallel experiments, we observed a strong correlation between IgG reactivity to HLA and apoptotic cells in pretransplant serum samples collected from 300 kidney transplant recipients. Further analysis revealed that samples with higher reactivity to apoptotic cells displayed significantly higher class I percent panel-reactive antibodies compared to samples with low reactivity to apoptotic cells. CONCLUSIONS: We provide here (1) proof of principle at the clonal level that human polyreactive antibodies can cross-react to HLA, multiple self-antigens and apoptotic cells and (2) supportive evidence that polyreactive antibodies contribute to overall HLA reactivity in the serum of patients awaiting kidney transplant.","['R01 DK083352/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK083352/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",,,,,['NIHMS694299'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported in patients with leukemia treated with dasatinib, a second-generation BCR-ABL TKI. To better understand characteristics and outcomes of dasatinib-treated patients with PAH, all clinical cases of PAH confirmed by right-heart catheterization in the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmacovigilance database (N = 41), including 22 previously unpublished cases, were examined for previous treatments for leukemia, patient characteristics, time to PAH onset, and outcomes. Our analysis shows that compared with PAH due to other etiologies, dasatinib-related PAH is atypical, in that it is associated with partial to complete reversibility upon treatment discontinuation. The incidence of dasatinib-related PAH appears to be low. Most PAH cases were observed in patients who had received prior treatments for leukemia. No specific patient attributes appear to be associated with an increased risk of developing PAH while receiving dasatinib. Symptoms of PAH in dasatinib-treated leukemia patients should prompt a thorough workup, including consideration of confirmatory right-heart catheterization. In cases of confirmed PAH, dasatinib should be discontinued.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Control theory that deals with dynamic systems has been successfully used to capture systems-level knowledge in large amount of quantitative biological interactions. But from the perspective of system control, the ways by which multiple genetic factors jointly perturb a disease phenotype still remain. RESULTS: In this work, we combine tools from control theory and network science to address the diversified control paths in complex networks. Then the ways by which the disease genes perturb biological systems are identified and quantified by the control paths in a human regulatory network. Furthermore, as an application, prioritization of candidate genes is presented by use of control path analysis and gene ontology annotation for definition of similarities. We use leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the ability of finding the gene-disease relationship. Results have shown compatible performance with previous sophisticated works, especially in directed systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our results inspire a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive pathological processes. Diversified control paths offer a basis for integrated intervention techniques which will ultimately lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work was to compare the multidrug resistance (MDR) signature of IGHV mutated and unmutated CLL cells, identifying biochemical and molecular targets potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention.We found that the mevalonate pathway-dependent Ras/ERK1-2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling cascades, and the downstream HIF-1alpha/P-glycoprotein axis were more active in IGHV unmutated than in mutated cells, leading to a constitutive protection from doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. The constitutive MDR phenotype of IGHV unmutated cells was partially dependent on B cell receptor signaling, as shown by the inhibitory effect exerted by ibrutinib. Stromal cells further protected IGHV unmutated cells from doxorubicin by upregulating Ras/ERK1-2, RhoA/RhoA kinase, Akt, HIF-1alpha and P-glycoprotein activities. Mevalonate pathway inhibition with simvastatin abrogated these signaling pathways and reversed the resistance of IGHV unmutated cells to doxorubicin, also counteracting the protective effect exerted by stromal cells. Similar results were obtained via the targeted inhibition of the downstream molecules ERK1-2, RhoA kinase and HIF-1alpha.Therefore, targeting the mevalonate pathway and its downstream signaling cascades is a promising strategy to circumvent the MDR signature of IGHV unmutated CLL cells.",,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated different angiogenic and immune biomarkers to gain insights into the mechanisms of action of maintenance therapy in children with ALL. We thus monitored circulating endothelial cells (CEC), endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and endothelial microparticles (EMP), pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, VEGFR-1 and Ang-2), anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) in 47 children with ALL during the maintenance phase of their treatment (at treatment initiation and after 6, 12 and 18 months). We observed a statistically significant decrease in EPC and EMP counts throughout the maintenance phase associated with a significant increase in THBS1 levels. No significant change was detected in other angiogenic markers or in Treg numbers.The results presented here indicate that maintenance therapy in children with ALL exerts its antitumor activity at least in part through anti-angiogenic effects, similar to those induced by metronomic chemotherapy. Larger studies are now warranted to validate these findings and determine their clinical implications.",,['0 (Thrombospondin 1)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actual overall survival (OS) was assessed in patients with IPSS LR-MDS (i.e. low and intermediate-1) using Kaplan-Meier methods. Harrell's c index (HCI) and Akaike information criteria (AIC) were used to compare the models. Median OS of 1,140 eligible patients was 47 months (95% CI, 44-52). Median follow-up was 62 months.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting breakpoint cluster region-ABL are the first-line therapy for most CML patients and have drastically improved the prognosis of CML. However, some CML patients are unresponsive to TKI treatment, and a notable proportion of initially responsive patients develop drug resistance. Several molecular pathways have been correlated with resistance to TKI treatment, however, the exact mechanism of developing drug resistance remains ambiguous. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the progression of CML and the development of resistance to TKI treatment based on their important regulatory function in cell homeostasis, and the deregulation observed in the initiation and progression of many leukemia subtypes. In this review, we summarize some of the major discoveries regarding miRNAs in CML, and their relevance as biomarkers for diagnosis, disease progression, and drug sensitivity.","['R01 GM118796/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA179144/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21CA179144-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS725752'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This transplantation milieu has resulted in favorable outcomes with low transplantation-related mortality, owing to a low incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), without increased infectious complications. However, the high relapse rate remains a major concern. We therefore performed a prospective pilot study of HLA haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) with intensified conditioning, followed by two lower doses of PT/Cy. A total of 20 patients with refractory or poor-prognosis myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia were enrolled in the study. A trend toward a lower incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD at day 100 in the group receiving 25 mg/kg x 2 doses of PT/Cy, compared with the group receiving 25 mg/kg of PT/Cy (9.1% vs. 33%, p = 0.20), was noted. However, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was low, at 10% irrespective of PT/Cy dose. The number of infused CD34(+) cells significantly correlated with the grade of acute GVHD (p = 0.004). In addition, the occurrence of BK virus hemorrhagic cystitis was significantly more common in the double-dose PT/Cy group (25% vs. 0%, p = 0.043), especially when combined with busulfan. The probability of overall survival at 1 year in the double-dose group tended to be better compared with that in the single-dose group (64% vs. 44%, respectively; p = 0.20). In conclusion, HLA haploidentical, T-cell-replete PBSCT with 25 mg/kg x 2 doses of PT/Cy might be a feasible option for treating high-risk leukemia and MDS.",,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic effects play crucial roles in tumor development and progression. Thereby, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) represents a further base modification of cytosine besides 5-methylcytosine (5mC). In addition to the role of 5hmC as an intermediate in demethylation, 5hmC is of reasonable importance for cellular control. Previous studies showed that loss of 5hmC is a hallmark of human malignancies, e.g. in glioma, melanoma, and myeloid tumors. In myeloid malignancies studies showed that loss of 5hmC was due to mutations within ten-eleven-translocation (TET) genes, enzymes being responsible for conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. Nevertheless, till date there are no genetic characterization data of TET enzymes available for glioma. In this study, we genetically characterized TET2 and TET3 alterations in 50 human gliomas (WHO-Grade II-IV) and in 19 healthy brain samples. We identified 7 genetic alterations within TET2 (p.V218M, p.G355N, p.P363L, p.L1721W, p.P1723S, p.I1762V, p.H1778R). Additionally, we performed quantification of 5hmC amount and added functional prediction analysis of identified TET alterations to evaluate the biological impact of these alterations on the hydroxymethylome. An analysis of TET3 showed no non-synonymous alterations. In summary, we did not find correlations of TET alterations with 5hmC amount. Thus, our data emphasize that, in contrast to leukemia, loss of 5hmC in glioma is not caused by TET gene alterations. Moreover, other disturbances, such as disrupted gene expressions or functional inhibitions of TET proteins may be responsible for the aberrant epigenome of human glioma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eleven children and teenagers (4 girls, 7 boys; mean age 14.3 +/- 2.9 years) participated in this monocentric pilot programme of adapted physical activities from February 2013 to March 2013. Seven were still on treatment. The programme lasted 6 weeks. A series of physical tests and psychological questionnaires were carried out before and after the programme. RESULTS: All children and teenagers completed the full programme. An improvement in all physical and psychological parameters was observed. Statistically significant differences were observed for global self-esteem (6.2 +/- 2.1 to 7.7 +/- 1.8; p = 0.02), perceived sport competence (5.3 +/- 3.2 to 7.4 +/- 2; p = 0.02) and perceived physical strength (5.6 +/- 2.5 to 7.1 +/- 1.8; p = 0.001). Regarding physical tests, the physical training led to statistically significant improvement for sit-ups (13.8 +/- 2.6 to 21.75 +/- 5.4; p = 0.01), muscle tone (76 +/- 23.7 to 100 +/- 22.9; p = 0.01), and resting heart rate (96.1 +/- 3.2 to 91.6 +/- 4.5; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This programme is feasible in children and adolescents even during their oncologic treatment. During the 6-week programme, children and adolescents improved their physical and psychological health, and the putative benefits of the APAP are discussed.

Epub 2015 Aug 17.,"Blinatumomab is a CD19/CD3 bispescific antibody designed to redirect T cells toward malignant B cells and induce their lysis. It recently gained accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RR-ALL). In the phase II trial that served as the basis for approval, blinatumomab demonstrated significant single-agent activity and induced remission [complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts (CRh)] in 43% of 189 adult patients with RR-ALL; the majority of responders (82%) also attained negative minimal residual disease (MRD(-)) status that did not generally translate into long-term remissions in most cases. Additional studies show that blinatumomab can induce high response rates associated with lasting remissions in patients in first remission treated for MRD positivity, suggesting a role for blinatumomab in the upfront, MRD-positive setting. Blinatumomab infusion follows a predictable immunopharmacologic profile, including early cytokine release that can be associated with a clinical syndrome, T-cell expansion, and B-cell depletion. Neurologic toxicities represent a unique toxicity that shares similarities with adverse effects of other T-cell engaging therapies. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimal disease setting and timing for blinatumomab therapy. Additional insights into the pathogenesis, risk factors, and prevention of neurologic toxicities as well as a better understanding of the clinical consequences and biologic pathways that are associated with drug resistance are needed.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 17.,"PURPOSE: Clinical trials of ibrutinib combined with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) report encouraging results. Paradoxically, in preclinical studies, in vitro ibrutinib was reported to decrease CD20 expression and inhibit cellular effector mechanisms. We therefore set out to investigate effects of in vivo ibrutinib treatment that could explain this paradox. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received single-agent ibrutinib (420 mg daily) on an investigator-initiated phase II trial. Serial blood samples were collected pretreatment and during treatment for ex vivo functional assays to examine the effects on CLL cell susceptibility to anti-CD20 mAbs. RESULTS: We demonstrate that CD20 expression on ibrutinib was rapidly and persistently downregulated (median reduction 74%, day 28, P < 0.001) compared with baseline. Concomitantly, CD20 mRNA was decreased concurrent with reduced NF-kappaB signaling. An NF-kappaB binding site in the promoter of MS4A1 (encoding CD20) and downregulation of CD20 by NF-kappaB inhibitors support a direct transcriptional effect. Ex vivo, tumor cells from patients on ibrutinib were less susceptible to anti-CD20 mAb-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity than pretreatment cells (median reduction 75%, P < 0.001); however, opsonization by the complement protein C3d, which targets cells for phagocytosis, was relatively maintained. Expression of decay-accelerating factor (CD55) decreased on ibrutinib, providing a likely mechanism for the preserved C3d opsonization. In addition, ibrutinib significantly inhibited trogocytosis, a major contributor to antigen loss and tumor escape during mAb therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ibrutinib promotes both positive and negative interactions with anti-CD20 mAbs, suggesting that successfully harnessing maximal antitumor effects of such combinations requires further investigation.",['ZIA HL002346-11/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['NIHMS716586'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the safety and efficacy of clofarabine-based salvage therapy. The study was designed as phase II, multicenter, intent-to-transplant (ITT) study. A total of 84 patients with r/r AML were enrolled. All patients received at least one cycle of CLARA (clofarabine 30 mg/m(2) and cytarabine 1 g/m(2), days 1-5). Chemo-responsive patients with a donor received HSCT in aplasia after first CLARA. Generally, HSCT was performed as soon as possible. The conditioning regimen consisted of clofarabine (4 x 30 mg/m(2)) and melphalan (140 mg/m(2)). The median patient age was 61 years (range 40-75). On day 15 after start of CLARA, 26% of patients were in a morphologically leukemia-free state and 79% exposed a reduction in bone marrow blasts. Overall, 67% of the patients received HSCT within the trial. The primary end point, defined as complete remission after HSCT, was achieved by 60% of the patients. According to the ITT, overall survival at 2 years was 43% (95% confidence interval (CI), 32-54%). The 2-year disease-free survival for transplanted patients was 52% (95% CI, 40-69%).

Epub 2015 Aug 17.,"Genomic structural variations (SVs) are pervasive in many types of cancers. Characterizing their underlying mechanisms and potential molecular consequences is crucial for understanding the basic biology of tumorigenesis. Here, we engineered a local assembly-based algorithm (laSV) that detects SVs with high accuracy from paired-end high-throughput genomic sequencing data and pinpoints their breakpoints at single base-pair resolution. By applying laSV to 97 tumor-normal paired genomic sequencing datasets across six cancer types produced by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, we discovered that non-allelic homologous recombination is the primary mechanism for generating somatic SVs in acute myeloid leukemia. This finding contrasts with results for the other five types of solid tumors, in which non-homologous end joining and microhomology end joining are the predominant mechanisms. We also found that the genes recursively mutated by single nucleotide alterations differed from the genes recursively mutated by SVs, suggesting that these two types of genetic alterations play different roles during cancer progression. We further characterized how the gene structures of the oncogene JAK1 and the tumor suppressors KDM6A and RB1 are affected by somatic SVs and discussed the potential functional implications of intergenic SVs.","['U41 HG007000/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U41HG007000/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Proteins)'],,"['(c) The Author(s) 2015.

Epub 2015 Aug 14.,"The National Marrow Donor Program and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research provided guidelines for the use of anti-HLA antibodies and HLA-DP-mismatched loci in unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, a deeper understanding of other potentially useful biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes in HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, and -DQA1 (12/12)-matched unrelated donor HSCT is needed to further improve clinical outcomes. We tested HLA genotyping for 123 pairs of patients and donors. Anti-HLA antibodies using the Luminex method was applied to 123, 117, and 106 serum samples collected before and 1 month and 3 months after transplantation. The presences of anti-HLA antibodies at the 3 time points were 37.4% (46 of 123), 40.2% (47 of 117), and 22.6% (24 of 106). Mismatch of HLA-DPB1 and/or DPA1 allele between patient-donor pairs was 83.6% (92 of 110). Patients with anti-HLA antibodies had delayed platelet recovery. The presence of anti-HLA antibodies and their dynamic changes after transplantation were associated with increased occurrence of grades II to IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), higher treatment-related mortality, and reduced overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival, especially in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Multivariate analysis showed that presence of anti-HLA antibodies before transplantation was a risk factor for GVHD and OS. Furthermore, HLA-DP loci-matched subgroup showed a trend towards a lower rate of acute GVHD and a higher OS in the anti-HLA Abs-negative group. Our results suggest that dynamic changes of anti-HLA antibodies independently predict for a negative outcome of HSCT, independent of HLA-DP loci mismatches. Routine monitoring for anti-HLA antibody dynamics should be conducted before and after HSCT.",,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We here report the results of a questionnaire specifically designed to evaluate factors influencing adherence and perceptions about the future, distributed to patients during regional Italian meetings. Overall, 1133 patients compiled the questionnaire: median age was 57 years. High rate of adherence was reported, but 42% of interviewed patients admitted that they had occasionally postponed a dose and 58% had discontinued therapy mainly for forgetfulness. The majority of patients discussed with personal physician about the importance of adherence and received sufficient information about illness and treatment, but would like to have discussed more about discomfort, anxiety and fear of the future. Summarizing personal drug compliance and estimating how many days a month, on average, the patients did not take the drug, the majority answered that it was less than 3 days (55%) and only a minority (4%) admitted that it was more than 7 days. Interviewed about discontinuation, 49% of patients answered that wouldn't interrupt because of fear of losing all the results achieved so far.

The kinds of ADRs experienced by cancer patients are varied. Therefore, the identification of appropriate manner in order to prevent ADRs may improve patient outcome. AIMS: The present study evaluated the incidence, frequency and common types of adverse drug reactions among hospitalized oncology patients. METHODS: Patients hospitalized at a university oncology center (children and adult) during the calendar year 2012 were randomly selected. Data were collected by reviewing of medical records. The outcome measures included the incidence of observed ADRs and ADR-related admissions and achieving strategies to prevent the emergence of chemotherapy side effects. RESULTS: ADRs frequently occurred in the age group less than 20 years (22%). Prevalence of leukemia (27%), colon cancer (16.5%) and breast cancer (14%) was higher in our region. Most ADRs were recorded in patients receiving cisplatin (44%), doxorubicin (24%) and 5-fluouracil (20%) as chemotherapy. The most frequently observed ADRs were nauseavomiting, neutropenia and constipation in both pediatric and adult population. CONCLUSION: This study shows that ADRs occur more frequently in the pediatric group compared to adults. Therefore, optimum use of preventative strategy program may contribute to reducing the incidence and severity of ADRs especially in this group.",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, high throughput approaches generate data that is challenging to process, interpret and present. RESULTS: Next generation sequencing (NGS) data was generated for MLVs from two wild caught Mus musculus domesticus (from mainland France and Corsica) and for inbred laboratory mouse strains C3H, LP/J and SJL. Sequence reads were grouped using a novel sequence clustering approach as applied to retroviral sequences. A Markov cluster algorithm was employed, and the sequence reads were queried for matches to specific xenotropic (Xmv), polytropic (Pmv) and modified polytropic (Mpmv) viral reference sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Various MLV subtypes were more widespread than expected among the mice, which may be due to the higher coverage of NGS, or to the presence of similar sequence across many different proviral loci. The results did not correlate with variation in the major MLV receptor Xpr1, which can restrict exogenous MLVs, suggesting that endogenous MLV distribution may reflect gene flow more than past resistance to infection.","['R01 GM092706/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM092706/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, development of novel LSCs-targeting therapeutic strategies is of crucial clinical importance to improve the treatment outcomes of AML. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have shown potent and specific anticancer stem cell activities in preclinical studies. Chidamide, a novel benzamide-type selectively HDAC inhibitor, has been reported to induce G1 arrest and apoptosis in the relatively mature progenitor population, whereas its effect on primitive LSCs has not been clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that chidamide specifically induces apoptosis in LSC-like cells and primary AML CD34(+) cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Our further molecular mechanistic study uncovered that chidamide induces LSCs death by activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It compromises the mitochondria membrane potential, modulates antiapoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins in BCL2 family and activates caspase-3 leading to PARP degradation. Meanwhile, chidamide activates CD40 and modulates its downstream signaling pathways, JNK and NFkappaB. The results of this study suggest that chidamide may be a novel LSC-targeting agent for AML therapeutics.",,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '87CIC980Y0', '(N-(2-amino-5-fluorobenzyl)-4-(N-(pyridine-3-acrylyl)aminomethyl)benzamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An accurate identification and characterization of monocytic cells is of major relevance for the diagnosis and classification of these neoplasias. In this regard, as compared to other conventional techniques, flow cytometry has shown the highest sensitivity for detection of early monocytic commitment of (normal and neoplastic) bone marrow CD34(+) hematopoietic precursors as well as of monocytic aberrations and maturation blockades, which are frequently associated with clonal myeloid disorders. In the present paper we provide basic principles and criteria for multiparameter flow cytometry identification and characterization of bone marrow monocytic cells that contribute to an improved diagnostic and classification of monocytic lineage-associated acute leukemias in clinical settings, particularly when using the EuroFlow antibody panels.

However, supraphysiological doses can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. HPA axis suppression resulting in reduced cortisol response may cause an impaired stress response and an inadequate host defence against infections, which remains a cause of morbidity and death. Suppression commonly occurs in the first days after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy, but the exact duration is unclear. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To examine the occurrence and duration of HPA axis suppression after (each cycle of) glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 6, 2014), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1945 to June 2014), and EMBASE/Ovid (from 1980 to June 2014). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings (the International Society for Paediatric Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology from 2005 to 2013), and ongoing trial databases (the ISRCTN register and the NIH register via http://www.controlled-trials.com in June 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: All study designs, except case reports and patient series with fewer than 10 children, examining the effect of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL on the HPA axis function. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed the study selection. One review author performed the data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment, which another review author checked. MAIN RESULTS: We identified eight studies (total of 218 children), including two randomised controlled trials (RCTs), that assessed the adrenal function. None of the studies assessed the HPA axis at the level of the hypothalamus, pituitary, or both. Due to substantial differences between studies, we could not pool results. All of the studies had some methodological limitations. The included studies demonstrated that adrenal insufficiency occurs in nearly all children in the first days after cessation of glucocorticoid treatment for childhood ALL. The majority of children recovered within a few weeks, but a small number of children had ongoing adrenal insufficiency lasting up to 34 weeks. In the RCTs, the occurrence and duration of adrenal insufficiency did not differ between the prednisone and dexamethasone arms. In one study, it appeared that treatment with fluconazole prolonged the duration of adrenal insufficiency. Furthermore, one of the studies evaluated the presence of infections or stress episodes, or both as a risk factor for adrenal insufficiency. The authors found no relationship between the presence of infection/stress and adrenal insufficiency. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that adrenal insufficiency commonly occurs in the first days after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL, but the exact duration is unclear. Since no data on the level of the hypothalamus and the pituitary were available, we cannot make any conclusions regarding those outcomes. Clinicians should consider prescribing glucocorticoid replacement therapy during periods of serious stress in the first weeks after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications. However, more high-quality research is needed for evidence-based guidelines for glucocorticoid replacement therapy.Special attention should be paid to patients receiving fluconazole therapy, and perhaps similar antifungal drugs, as this may prolong the duration of adrenal insufficiency.Finally, it would be relevant to further investigate the relationship between present infection/stress and adrenal insufficiency in a larger, separate study specially designed for this purpose.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012;(5):CD008727.

Epub 2015 Aug 17.,"Lymphocyte trafficking is orchestrated by chemokine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors that enable homing and egress from secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). These receptors undergo rapid internalization and plasma membrane recycling to calibrate cellular responses to local chemoattractants. Circulating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells display an abnormal increase in the surface levels of the homing receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 concomitant with low S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) expression. In this study, we investigated the role of receptor recycling on CXCR4/CCR7 surface levels in CLL cells and addressed the impact of quantitative alterations of these receptors and S1P1 on the ability of leukemic cells to accumulate in SLOs. We show that recycling accounts, to a major extent, for the high levels of surface CXCR4/CCR7 on CLL cells. In addition, increased expression of these receptors, together with S1P1 deficiency, is detectable not only in circulating leukemic cells, but also in SLOs of CLL patients with lymphoadenopathy. We further provide evidence that ibrutinib, a Btk inhibitor that promotes mobilization of leukemic cells from SLOs, normalizes the imbalance between CXCR4/CCR7 and S1P1. Taken together, our results highlight the relevance of chemokine and S1P receptor recycling in CLL pathogenesis and clinical outcome.",,"['0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Receptors, Lysosphingolipid)', '0 (S1PR1 protein, human)', '0 (Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors)']",,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We investigated disease characteristics and outcome for de novo AML patients 10-30 years old treated in pediatric or adult departments. We included 166 patients 10-18 years of age with AML treated according to the pediatric NOPHO-protocols (1993-2009) compared with 253 patients aged 15-30 years treated in hematology departments (1996-2009) in the Nordic countries. RESULTS: The incidence of AML was 4.9/million/year for the age group 10-14 years, 6.5 for 15-18 years, and 6.9 for 19-30 years. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was more frequent in adults and in females of all ages. Pediatric patients with APL had similar overall survival as pediatric patients without APL. Overall survival at 5 years was 60% (52-68%) for pediatric patients compared to 65% (58-70%) for adult patients. Cytogenetics and presenting white blood cell count were the only independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Age was not an independent prognostic factor.

Drug exposure is determined by pharmacokinetics and dose, whereas responsiveness is intrinsically variable by tumor heterogeneity. Molecular targeting drugs are used as promising therapy for cancers, and most of them are coupled with particular diagnostics which can predict responders and non-responders before treatment. On the other hand, lower drug exposure to the body can lead to insufficient efficacy. A number of important evidences have been published recently on exposure-response relationships for molecular targeting drugs including monoclonal antibodies and small molecules. In this chapter, two examples are presented; anti-HER2 antibody and tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients with the lowest trough concentrations of trastuzumab in cycle 1 showed shorter overall survival in metastatic gastric cancer study.

However, multiple randomized studies in the past have reported lower relapse rates after autologous transplantation compared with chemotherapy and lower non-relapse mortality rates compared with allogeneic transplantation. In addition, quality of life of long-term survivors is better after autologous transplantation than after allogeneic transplantation. Further, recent developments may improve outcomes of autograft recipients. These include the use of IV busulfan and the busulfan+melphalan combination, better detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) with molecular biology techniques, the introduction of targeted therapies and post-transplant maintenance therapy. Therefore, ASCT may nowadays be reconsidered for consolidation in the following patients if and when they reach a MRD-negative status: good- and at least intermediate-1 risk acute myelocytic leukemia in first CR, acute promyelocytic leukemia in second CR, Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia. Conversely, patients with MRD-positive status or high-risk leukemia should not be considered for consolidation with ASCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analogue 17 exhibited potent cytotoxicity and high selectivity toward HL-60 cell line with IC50 value of 1.02 muM, which suggested that it might be a promising anti-cancer lead compound. The inhibitory activities against NO production and the cytotoxicities in RAW 264.7 macrophages were determined at the same time. All of the analogues significantly inhibited the NO production with IC50 value in the range of 3.44-6.99 muM. Analogues 17, 22, 23 and 7 showed higher cytotoxicities, indicated their inhibitory activities against NO production may be influenced by the cytotoxicities.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Lactones)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The final concentrations of AlCl3 (AlCl3 . 6H2O) in supernatant were 0 (control group, CG), 0.3 mmol/L (low-dose group, LG), 0.6 mmol/L (mid-dose group, MG), and 1.2 mmol/L (high-dose group, HG), respectively.

The results showed that apoptosis index of lymphocytes, cAMP content in intracellular and PKA mRNA expression were significantly upregulated, whereas NF-kappaB and survivin mRNA expressions, nuclear NF-kappaB (p65) protein expression, and the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expression were downregulated in the AlCl3-treated groups compared with those in CG.

Using induced pluripotent stem cells and primary cells, we demonstrate that overexpression of ATG2B and GSKIP enhances hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, including of megakaryocytes, by increasing progenitor sensitivity to thrombopoietin (TPO). ATG2B and GSKIP cooperate with acquired JAK2, MPL and CALR mutations during MPN development.

The fungi were identified as 21 genera by morphology and ITS sequences. One dominant species was Phomopsis quercella in Hainan Tropical Botanical Garden and Bawangling Nature Reserve, with relative frequency of 42.06 and 34.88% respectively. Another dominant species was Colletotrichum boninense in Wuzhishan and Jianfengling Nature Reserves, with relative frequency of 36.84 and 46.97% respectively. Among the selected 21 endophytic fungi, 17 strains (80.95%) had activity against at least one pathogenic bacteria, and 14 strains (66.67%) exhibited activity against at least one fungal pathogens. Neonectria macroconidialis showed strong inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus (inhibition zone being 20 mm), Bacillus subtilis (14 mm) and Streptococcus agalactiae (28 mm). Xylaria sp. showed strong inhibition against Escherichia coli (20 mm), Rhizoctonia solani (20 mm) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (17 mm). Verticillium bulbillosum showed great activity against Strep. agalactiae (32 mm) and Fusarium oxysporum (22 mm). These endophytic fungi showed potentials in medicine development. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Endophytic fungi from medicinal plants are an important source of novel and viable drugs. Cephalotaxus hainanensis Li is well known for leukaemia treatment and its endophytic fungi were isolated to investigate the diversity and antimicrobial activity. It was found that Ce. hainanensis Li had rich endophytic fungi, and some fungi showed strong antimicrobial activity against certain pathogens.

High doses of intravenous polychemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and cranio-spinal radiation therapy are used by numerous groups. Majority of patients are cured after this strategy. The next challenge is to decrease toxicities of treatment, including long-term toxicities secondary to cranio-spinal radiation therapy observed in these cured patients. Liposomal cytarabine could be a good alternative to cranio-spinal radiation therapy as already reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We report here eleven patients treated in our center for BL, with liposomal cytarabine instead of cranio-spinal radiation therapy as prophylactic or curative treatment for CNS involvement.

To examine the possibility of using gene therapy for XLA, we constructed a helper-dependent adenovirus/adeno-associated virus BTK targeting vector (HD-Ad.AAV BTK vector) composed of a genomic sequence containing BTK exons 6-19 and a green fluorescence protein-hygromycin cassette driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. We first used NALM-6, a human male pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, as a recipient to measure the efficiency of gene targeting by homologous recombination. We identified 10 clones with the homologous recombination of the BTK gene among 107 hygromycin-resistant stable clones isolated from two independent experiments. We next used cord blood CD34(+) cells as the recipient cells for the gene targeting. We isolated colonies grown in medium containing cytokines and hygromycin. We found that the targeting of the BTK gene occurred in four of the 755 hygromycin-resistant colonies. Importantly, the gene targeting was also observed in CD19(+) lymphoid progenitor cells that were differentiated from the homologous recombinant CD34(+) cells during growth in selection media.

Various treatment options are available, but therapy is mainly systemic chemotherapy plus appropriate monoclonal antibodies. In certain situations radiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation play a role. Some types/subtypes of these diseases are potentially curable, yet many leukemias and lymphomas do not properly respond to current therapies. Although the FDA (US Food and Drugs Administration) approvals of new drugs have shown a small increasing trend between 2007-2012, overall, the trend of new approvals remains relatively steady between 2006-2013, with a peak of 39 new drugs approved in 2012 and a drop in the new FDA drug approvals in 2013, to 27. Drugs approved for cancer treatment have shown a similar trend. Between 2006-2013, at least one drug was approved every year for the treatment of particular types of lymphoma or leukemia, except in 2010, with a peak of 5 new approvals in 2012. Between January 2013-March 2014, several important new approvals were made: ibrutinib for the treatment of CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), obinutuzumab for the treatment of CLL (in combination with chlorambucil), and lenalidomide for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. The results, importance, adverse effects and mechanisms of action of these agents are discussed in this review. These results held promise and their discovery and approval for the treatment of CLL and MCL is a major step forward. However, the emergence of resistance and the lack of cures need to be addressed by rational development of combination therapy, as well as development of novel drugs with enhanced potency or different mechanism of action, to achieve better overall and complete response rates with decreased toxicity.",['R01 CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['NIHMS711865'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only few patients with long-term survival have been described in the literature. We report on a 5-year-old boy from a consanguineous marriage with molecular analysis for the LIFR gene. Sanger and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of LIFR were performed. Copy number variation analysis with NGS showed a novel mutation as the cause for the syndrome: an intragenic homozygous deletion in LIFR, involving exons 15-20. Bridging PCR was carried out to confirm the intragenic deletion. This is the first description of a large deletion in LIFR, broadening the spectrum of mutations in SWS. Besides the reported allelic heterogeneity, further studies such as exome sequencing are required to identify a novel gene in order to confirm the locus heterogeneity in SWS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which encodes a constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase. The oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase, which is located in the cytoplasm, is responsible for the leukemia phenotype through the constitutive activation of multiple signaling pathways involved in the cell cycle and in adhesion and apoptosis. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH) is not a specific disease. It occurs as a complication or secondary to various causes. These conditions probably lead to impaired blood supply to the femoral head. The diagnosis of AVNFH is based on clinical findings and is supported by specific radiological manifestations. We reported a case of a 34-year-old Sudanese female with CML who developed AVNFH after receiving dasatinib as a second-line therapy. Though the mechanism by which dasatinib can cause avascular necrosis (AVN) is not clear, it can be postulated because of microcirculatory obstruction of the femoral head. To the best of our knowledge and after extensive literature search, this is the first reported case of AVNFH induced by dasatinib in a patient with CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there are several studies in this field, events related to disease initiation and progression remain unknown. The malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is thought to generate leukemic stem cells, and this transformation could be related to changes in mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) signaling. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze the gene expression profile of hMSC from AML patients (hMSC-AML) compared to healthy donors hMSCs (hMSC-HD). The results showed a common molecular signature for all hMSC-AML. Other assays were performed with a large number of patients and the results confirmed a molecular signature that is capable of distinguishing hMSC-AML from hMSC-HD. Moreover, CCL2 and BMP4 genes encode secreted proteins that could affect HSCs. To verify whether these proteins are differentially expressed in AML patients, ELISA was performed with plasma samples. CCL2 and BMP4 proteins are differentially expressed in AML patients, indicating changes in hMSC-AML signaling. Altogether, hMSCs-AML signaling alterations could be an important factor in the leukemic transformation process.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we show that TIM-3 and its ligand, galectin-9 (Gal-9), constitute an autocrine loop critical for LSC self-renewal and development of human AML. Serum Gal-9 levels were significantly elevated in AML patients and in mice xenografted with primary human AML samples, and neutralization of Gal-9 inhibited xenogeneic reconstitution of human AML. Gal-9-mediated stimulation of TIM-3 co-activated NF-kappaB and beta-catenin signaling, pathways known to promote LSC self-renewal. These changes were further associated with leukemic transformation of a variety of pre-leukemic disorders and together highlight that targeting the TIM-3/Gal-9 autocrine loop could be a useful strategy for treating myeloid leukemias.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although conventional chemotherapy bears the potential to cure some AML patients, the course of the disease is frequently fatal despite treatment highlighting the need for novel therapeutic concepts. Recent progress in genetic technologies significantly furthered our understanding of the molecular events leading to the disease, but these advances have not yet been successfully translated into improved treatment outcomes. Here, we review some of the new promising targets expressed by leukemic blasts, including important signaling pathways involved in AML stem/progenitor cell maintenance and drug resistance.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Primary leukemic cells were obtained from AML patient's bone marrow. These cells were then exposed to different concentration of cytarabine and curcumin to find out IC50 values and also its effect on MDR genes like MDR1, BCRP, LRP and FLT3 by RT-PCR method. RESULT & CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that curcumin down regulates MDR genes. Gene expression was decreased by 35.75, 31.30, 27.97 % for MDR1, LRP, BCRP respectively. In FLT3, it was 65.86 % for wild type and 31.79 % for FLT3-ITD. In addition to this, curcumin has also shown anti-proliferative effect as well as synergistic effect in combination with Cytarabine on primary leukemic cells. Thus, we can conclude that curcumin can be used as MDR modulator as well as chemosensitizer in combination with cytarabine, standard chemotherapeutic drug, to reduce the cytotoxicity profile as IC50 value decreases when treated in combination.",,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our understanding of AML has relied on an intensive in-vitro research approach, based on AML cell lines as well as primary AML patient cells. However, experimental insight into the early events of AML leukemogenesis before they become clinically observable is not possible in humans. Thus, preclinical animal models have served the purpose to extend our knowledge of the disease as well as to develop innovative therapeutic strategies. Today, xenograft models using patient-derived neoplastic/leukemia cells represent the strategy of choice for preclinical studies of AML. These models exhibit several key advantages over AML cell lines. In fact, patient-derived cells, in contrast to AML cell lines, encompass the entire complexity of AML disease and can therefore provide more trustworthy results on the efficacy outcome of novel therapies. One other important aspect in the development of xenograft models of AML is the possibility to use imaging techniques to monitor in-vivo the progression of the disease. Imaging techniques also authorize the evaluation of the efficacy of an experimental treatment on tumor growth. This review will focus on the description of xenograft models of AML and will provide researchers and clinicians an overview of how these models have been used for the development of new therapeutic options and new imaging approaches to study AML in-vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the oceans have received growing interest as a source for new useful bioactive compounds, and there are currently several drugs derived from marine natural products for the treatment of cancer on the market. The current recommended chemotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is founded on cytarabine, a molecule derived from a natural product isolated from a marine sponge. However, in order to increase the efficiency of the chemotherapy used in the treatment of AML, it is necessary to develop more targeted drugs with less pronounced side effects.

The use of nanosized particulate drug carriers such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles has the potential to improve AML therapy by delivering more of the drug to the disease site, thereby reducing toxicity. For example, encapsulation in liposomes reduces the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines, giving an improved therapeutic index. Moreover, when the surface properties are engineered appropriately, nanocarriers remain in the circulation and extravasate in tissues with sinusoidal capillaries, one of which is bone marrow, leading to a more favourable distribution of the associated drug. Drug carrier technology contributes to the development of newer drugs, such as nucleic acids that can be protected from degradation and delivered into cells, thus opening the way for gene-silencing strategies. Furthermore, carrier systems provide a means of dispersing poorly water-soluble molecule for in vivo administration and thus increase the ""druggability"" of new lead compounds, such as heat-shock protein inhibitors. Particulate carriers can transport more than one active agent, allowing synergistic action and theranostic strategies. Notably, phase I and II clinical trials are being performed with CPX-351, a liposomal formulation containing cytarabine and daunorubicin at an optimal ratio. Finally, by attaching suitable ligands to the nanocarrier surface, specific targeting to AML cells can be achieved. In this review, we give examples of successful targeting to folate and transferrin receptors against AML.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colloids)', '0 (Drug Carriers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 14.,"The DNA alkylating agent busulfan is used to 'precondition' patients with leukemia, lymphomas and other hematological disorders prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Busulfan is metabolized via conjugation with glutathione (GSH) followed by intramolecular rearrangement to the GSH analog gamma-glutamyl-dehydroalanyl -glycine (EdAG). EdAG contains the electrophilic dehydroalanine, which is expected to react with protein nucleophiles, particularly proteins with GSH binding sites such as glutaredoxins (Grx's). Incubation of EdAG with human Grx-1 or Grx-2 results in facile adduction of cys-23 and cys-77, respectively, as determined by ESI-MS/MS. The resulting modified proteins are catalytically inactive. In contrast, the glutathione transferase A1-1 includes a GSH binding site with a potentially reactive tyrosinate (Tyr-9) but it does not react with EdAG. Similarly, Cys-112 of GSTA1-1, which lies outside the active site and is known to form disulfides with GSH, does not react with EdAG. The results provide the first demonstration of the reactivity of any busulfan metabolites with intact proteins, and they suggest that GSH-binding sites containing thiolates are most susceptible. The adduction of Grx's by EdAG suggests the possible alteration of proteins that are normally regulated via Grx-dependent reversible glutathionylation or deglutathionylation. Dysregulation of Grx-dependent processes could contribute to cellular toxicity of busulfan.","['R01 CA182963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM062284/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA182963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Glutaredoxins)', '0 (gamma-glutamyl-dehydroalanyl-glycine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We previously showed that neutrophils are involved in MV-mediated tumor regressions and become activated, upon MV infection. In the present study, we attempted to enhance the neutrophil response toward MV-infected tumor targets by generating an oncolytic MV-expressing human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (MVhGCSF). Evaluating the effects in two different models of B-cell malignancy, we showed that depletion of neutrophils abrogated the MV therapeutic effect in an in vivo Raji-but not Nalm-6 tumor model. Next, we compared MVhGCSF with the unmodified backbone virus MVNSe. MVhGCSF enhanced the oncolytic capacity of MV in the Raji model in vivo, whereas in the Nalm-6 model, the opposite was unexpectedly the case. This finding was recapitulated by exogenously administered hGCSF. MVhGCSF replicated within an MV-infectable CD46 transgenic mouse model with detectable serum levels of hGCSF but no toxicity. Our data suggest that a ""one-size-fits-all"" model of immune response to viral oncolysis is not appropriate, and each tumor target will need full characterization for the potential of both direct and indirect, innate immune responses to generate benefit.",,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transurethral resection of the bladder tumour by cystoscopy was performed. Histopathology showed high grade, muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. Due to presence of uptake in the prostate, transurethral resection of the prostate was done and histopathology revealed adenocarcinoma of prostate (prostate specific antigen- positive), Gleason grade III+III and Gleason score 6.

However, little is known for AML. We analyzed a cohort of 3526 patients with AML treated in three prospective multicenter trials within the German Study Alliance Leukemia. In multivariate analyses, we identified BMI as an independent risk factor for both DFS (HR 1.014, P = 0.0217) and OS (HR 1.015, P < 0.0036). Interestingly, overweight and obesity seemed to be a risk factor predominantly in patients with de novo AML younger than 65 yr with intermediate risk and adverse cytogenetics. Overweight with a BMI >/=25 kg/m(2) best discriminated the worse outcome and led to an absolute reduction in long-term survival of 5-7% in the group of all younger patients (3-yr OS 39.9% vs. 47.3%; 10-yr OS 28.7% vs. 33.8%, P = 0.0002). Additionally, response to induction therapy was significantly reduced in these patients (76.9% vs. 82.8%, P < 0.0001). Thus, in younger patients with de novo AML, overweight and obesity are risk factors for impaired response to induction therapy, DFS and OS. This effect is, in part but not fully, explained by dose reduction such as dose-capping at a body surface area of 2 m(2).",,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in cats using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays targeting internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) and heat-shock protein 70 gene (Hsp70) regions with Leishmania species-specific primers and probes. Blood samples were collected from 147 cats (73 female; 74 male) in the endemic regions for zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in the western provinces of Turkey and analyzed using two RT-PCR assays. Additionally, Hsp70 RT-PCR products were sequenced. ELISA assays for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) were also carried out for 145 of the 147 samples. Overall, 13/147 (8.84%) cats were positive for Leishmania by RT-PCR (4 L. major and 9 L. tropica). FIV and FeLV antibody and/or antigen was detected in 4 and 5 cats among Leishmania DNA positives, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate and report the presence of L. major and L. tropica infections in a large group of domestic cats in Turkey. The results obtained indicate that species identification of Leishmania is essential for epidemiological understanding and that clinical signs alone are not indicative for leishmaniosis in cats, as it is in dogs. This study suggests that extensive research should be carried out in cat populations in order to fully understand the role of cats in the epidemiology of the disease.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In children older than 2 years, there was a predominance of CNAs involving deletions in IKZF1, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B, whereas the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) had deletions that were found more frequently in infants (P <0.05). Based on the cytogenetic subgroups, favorable cytogenetic subgroups showed more deletions than other subgroups that occurred simultaneously, specifically ETV6 deletions (P <0.05). TCF3-PBX1 was frequently deleted in RB1, and an absence of deletions was observed in IKZF1 and genes localized to the PAR1 region. The results corroborate with previous genome-wide studies and aggregate new markers for risk stratification of BCP-ALL in Brazil.",,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"Treatment failure in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is frequently due to the persistence of a cell population resistant to chemotherapy through different mechanisms, in which drug efflux via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, specifically P-glycoprotein, is one of the most recognized. However, disappointing results from clinical trials employing inhibitors for these transporters have demonstrated the need to adopt different strategies. We hypothesized that microtubule targeting compounds presenting high affinity or covalent binding could overcome the effect of ABC transporters. We therefore evaluated the activity of the high-affinity paclitaxel analog CTX-40 as well as the covalent binder zampanolide (ZMP) in AML cells. Both molecules were active in chemosensitive as well as in chemoresistant cell lines overexpressing P-glycoprotein. Moreover, ZMP or CTX-40 in combination with daunorubicin showed synergistic killing without increased in vitro hematopoietic toxicity. In a primary AML sample, we further demonstrated that ZMP and CTX-40 are active in progenitor and differentiated leukemia cell populations. In sum, our data indicate that high affinity and covalent-binding anti-microtubule agents are active in AML cells otherwise chemotherapy resistant.",['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (zampanolide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) is the most common subtype of pediatric MDS and has overlapping clinical features with viral infections and autoimmune disorders. Mutations in TET2 gene are found in about 20-25% of adult MDS and are associated with a decrease in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) content. TET2 deregulation and its malignant potential were reported in adult but not in pediatric MDS. We evaluated the gene expression and the presence of mutations in TET2 gene in 19 patients with RCC. TET2 expression level was correlated with 5-hmC amount in DNA and possible regulatory epigenetic mechanisms. One out of 19 pediatric patients with RCC was a carrier of a TET2 mutation. TET2 expression and 5-hmC levels were decreased in patients when compared to a disease-free group. Lower expression was not associated to the presence of mutation or with the status of promoter methylation, but a significant correlation with microRNA-22 expression was found. These findings suggested that TET2 downregulation and low levels of 5-hmC are inversely related to miR-22 expression. The existence of a regulatory loop between microRNA-22 and TET2 may play a role in MDS pathogenesis.",,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN22 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the value of CD34, CD117, CD7, and CD123 expression in a consecutive series of 592 adult patients with de novo AML. RESULTS: CD34+ measured as a percentage (>/=2.88%) and CD34 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (>/=146.79, arbitrary units [AU]) expression had a prognostic impact in terms of overall survival (OS; P = .005, P = .003), leukemia-free survival (LFS; P = .011, P < .001), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; P = .014, P =. 001). The percentage of CD117+ cells (61.29%) was associated with shorter LFS (P =. 043), and CD117 MFI (>/=284.01 AU) was associated with a shorter OS (P =. 033) and LFS (P =. 028). In the multivariate analysis, high CD34 MFI retained the independent value as predictor of LFS and CIR (P =. 012; hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.28 and P =. 045; HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.01-2.46).

METHODS: Twenty-one submitted cases are reviewed and summarized, with emphasis on key diagnostic or biologic points, and supplemented with relevant literature citations. RESULTS: Early T-cell precursor (ETP)-ALL represented about one-third of all cases submitted. It is important to recognize ETP-ALL, because these patients have a poor prognosis if treated with standard therapy. A consensus immunophenotype has been developed to aid in the recognition of these cases. Other cases submitted illustrated rare entities, including two cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive T-ALL, two cases of T-ALL associated with MYC translocations, and single cases illustrating various diseases. A subset of cases submitted illustrated issues related to differential diagnosis of T-ALL/T-LBL. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the growing importance of molecular genetic analysis in the diagnosis and prognosis of T-ALL/T-LBL, it is important for pathologists to keep abreast of these developments. Currently, routine histopathology, immunophenotyping, conventional cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and clonality testing are usually adequate to establish the diagnosis. However, as therapies become more targeted, assessment for relevant genetic abnormalities, either through candidate gene or broad-scale unbiased approaches, may become necessary.",,,,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cases showed rare aberrancies such as coexistent IGH/BCL2 and MYC rearrangements and raised issues in classification. Other cases had unusual clinical presentations, including B-ALL with hypereosinophilia and therapy-related B-ALL. Several cases highlighted the role of flow cytometry immunophenotyping in distinguishing benign B-cell precursors from aberrant lymphoblasts, and other cases raised questions regarding the clinical importance of myeloperoxidase positivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity and spectrum of cases presented in this review highlight the importance of clinicopathologic correlation and the value of ancillary studies in the classification and workup of patients with B-ALL/LBL.",,,,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We provide an overview of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) as recognized in the current World Health Organization classification and summarize diagnostic criteria for major categories of MPAL: B/myeloid, T/myeloid, B/T, and B/T/myeloid. RESULTS: Most MPAL cases submitted were B/myeloid and T/myeloid MPAL, the most frequent types, but three cases of B/T MPAL were also submitted, and examples of all categories are illustrated. We emphasize that a comprehensive approach to immunophenotyping is required to accurately establish the diagnosis of MPAL. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping using a large panel of antibodies is needed as well as confirmatory immunohistochemical analysis and cytochemistry studies for myeloperoxidase and nonspecific esterase. We discuss technical issues in determining blast lineage and possible pitfalls in MPAL diagnosis. In particular, rare cases of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) can express myeloperoxidase but are otherwise consistent with B-ALL and should be treated as such. Last, we review the differential diagnosis between acute undifferentiated leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: There was an agreement that diagnosis of MPAL can be challenging, especially if applied flow cytometry panels are not comprehensive enough.",,,,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 11.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most frequent malignant disease and the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this clinically heterogeneous disease are complex and remain far from completely understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal microRNA (miRNA) expression is involved in tumorigenesis. However, their accurate expression pattern, function, and mechanism in GC remain unclear. Here, a heatmap analysis of the miRNomes was performed across TCGA datasets and the expression of miR-133 family was found to be consistently downregulated in GC. This result was confirmed in two GC cell lines and 20 pairs of primary GC tissues, and further study demonstrated that the downregulation of miR-133 was mainly mediated by histone modification within its promoter region. Importantly, restoration of miR-133b/a-3p expression could suppress GC cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis by targeting anti-apoptotic molecules Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Consistent with in vitro results, reintroducing of miR-133b/a-3p expression significantly delayed tumor formation and reduced tumor size of GC cells in xenograft nude mice. And the inverse relationship between miR-133b/a-3p and its targets was verified in xenograft mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-133b/a-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in GC by directly targeting Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Revealing novel mechanism for oncogene inhibition by miRNA-mediated pathways offers new avenues for GC treatment.",,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN133 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the new scenario of targeted agents, there is an increasing interest in identifying patients who gain the maximum benefit from FCR. In this observational multicenter retrospective analysis of 404 CLL patients receiving frontline FCR, the combination of three biomarkers that are widely tested before treatment (IGHV mutation status, 11q deletion and 17p deletion; available in 80% of the study cohort) allowed to identify a very low-risk category of patients carrying mutated IGHV genes but neither 11q or 17p deletion that accounted for 28% of all cases. The majority of very low-risk patients (71%) remained free of progression after treatment and their hazard of relapse decreased after 4 years from FCR. The life expectancy of very low-risk patients (91% at 5 years) was superimposable to that observed in the matched normal general population, indicating that neither the disease nor complications of its treatment affected survival in this favorable CLL group. These findings need a prospective validation and may be helpful for the design of clinical trials aimed at comparing FCR to new targeted treatments of CLL, and, possibly, for optimized disease management.",['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Chromosome 17 deletion']",['Blood. 2015 Oct 15;126(16):1872-4.

Recent observations demonstrated that the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway may represent an alternative carbon source for anabolic processes in different tumors, therefore appearing particularly promising for therapeutic purposes. Because the carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a (CPT1a) is a protein that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of FAO, here we investigated the in vitro antileukemic activity of the novel CPT1a inhibitor ST1326 on leukemia cell lines and primary cells obtained from patients with hematologic malignancies. By real-time metabolic analysis, we documented that ST1326 inhibited FAO in leukemia cell lines associated with a dose- and time-dependent cell growth arrest, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis induction. Data obtained on primary hematopoietic malignant cells confirmed the FAO inhibition and cytotoxic activity of ST1326, particularly on acute myeloid leukemia cells.

Epub 2015 Aug 14.,"Glucocorticoids (GC) are widely used as antiinflammatory/immunosuppressive drugs and antitumor agents in several types of lymphoma and leukemia. Therapeutic doses of GC induce growth-suppressive and cytotoxic effects on various leukocytes including B cells. Molecular mechanisms of GC action include induction of GC target genes. Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) is a rapidly, potently, and invariably GC-induced gene. It mediates a number of GC effects, such as control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here we show that deletion of GILZ in mice leads to an accumulation of B lymphocytes in the bone marrow, blood, and lymphoid tissues. Gilz knockout (KO) mice develop a progressive nonlethal B lymphocytosis, with expansion of B220(+) cells in the bone marrow and in the periphery, dependent on increased B-cell survival. Decreased B-cell apoptosis in mice lacking GILZ correlates with increased NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and Bcl-2 expression. B cell-specific gilz KO mice confirmed that the effect of GILZ deletion is B-cell self-intrinsic. These results establish GILZ as an important regulator of B-cell survival and suggest that the deregulation of GILZ expression could be implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell disorders.",,"['0 (Dsip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0313-1615'],,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"PURPOSE: Histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) injection has been approved in Europe for the treatment of adults with acute myeloid leukemia, used in combination therapy with the T-cell-derived cytokine interleukin-2. Despite years of clinical applications of HDC in Europe, no data are available on its tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties in Chinese patients. The objective of this study was to determine the safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties of HDC in Chinese healthy volunteers (HVs). METHODS: In this Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized study, 20 Chinese HVs were randomized to receive a single dose of 0.5 or 1.0 mg HDC via a 10-minute subcutaneous injection. Whole-blood and urine samples were collected at designated time points after dosing. Plasma and urine concentrations of histamine and metabolite N-methyl histamine were measured using a validated HPLC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated through noncompartmental procedures based on concentration-time data. Adverse events and evaluation of clinical laboratory tests were used to assess the safety profile. The pharmacokinetic profile for a single-dose of 1.0 mg HDC in Chinese HVs was compared with that in Western HVs. FINDINGS: No severe adverse events occurred in this study, and the severity of all adverse events was grade I according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. For the pharmacokinetic parameters of histamine at the 0.5-mg and 1.0-mg dose levels, t(1/2) was 0.50 and 1.02 hours; Tmax was 0.15 and 0.14 hours; mean Cmax was 26.59 and 71.01 nmol/L; AUC0-t was 8.35 and 20.43 nmol/h/L; AUC0-infinity was 9.61 and 22.69 nmol/h/L; accumulated amount excreted in urine within 24 hours was 125.93 and 145.52 nmol; and maximum urine excretion rates were 21.85 and 38.94 nmol/h, respectively. For N-methyl histamine at the 0.5-mg and 1.0-mg dose levels, t(1/2) was 0.58 and 0.66 hours; Tmax was 0.28 and 0.26 hours; mean Cmax was 17.01 and 23.54 nmol/L; AUC0-t was 7.72 and 17.08 nmol/h/L; AUC0-infinity was 9.01 and 19.62 nmol/h/L; accumulated amount excreted in urine within 24 hours was 331.7 and 583.21 nmol; and maximum urine excretion rates were 53.29 and 133.53 nmol/h, respectively. IMPLICATIONS: Both single-dose 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg HDC were well tolerated in Chinese HVs, and the pharmacokinetic profile of HDC in Chinese HVs was characterized in this study. A single dose of 1.0 mg HDC had a more rapid but similar extent of absorption, a wider distribution, and a little more rapid elimination in Chinese HVs compared with Western HVs. Findings from this study support additional clinical trials for HDC using in Chinese patients.

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse group of clonal hematopoietic malignancies characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, progressive bone marrow (BM) failure, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, and variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The BM microenvironment in MDS plays an important role in the development of this disorder. The BM stromal cells of MDS patients often harbor distinct chromosomal aberrations than the hematopoietic elements, suggesting different genetic origins. Perturbed cytokine secretions from BM stromal cells such as multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells are associated with increased proliferation and survival of malignant hematopoietic cells. Within the MDS BM there are also alterations in stromal cell composition, signaling and angiogenesis between Low- and High-risk MDS patients. Several open lines of investigation into the MDS niche remain, including the timing of stromal defects in context to dysplastic hematopoiesis. Another important, unanswered question is the impact of age on BM stroma function and regulation (or dysregulation) or hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. With a better understanding of the MDS niche, new therapeutic strategies will emerge.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 11.,"In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of T lymphoblastic leukemic Molt4 cells with farnesol activates the apoptosome via the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. This induction was associated with changes in the level of intracellular potassium and calcium, the dissipation of the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of several caspases, and PARP cleavage. The induction of apoptosis by farnesol was inhibited by the addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and by the exogenous expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. Analysis of the gene expression profiles by microarray analysis revealed that farnesol increased the expression of several genes related to the unfolded protein response (UPR), including CHOP and CHAC1. This induction was associated with the activation of the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF3/4 cascade, but not the XBP-1 branch of the UPR. Although farnesol induced activation of the ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways, inhibition of these MAPKs had little effect on farnesol-induced apoptosis or the induction of UPR-related genes. Our data indicate that the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells by farnesol is mediated through a pathway that involves activation of the apoptosome via the intrinsic pathway and induction of the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF3/4 cascade in a manner that is independent of the farnesol-induced activation of MAPKs.","['Z01 ES101586/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 ES101586-05/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (ATF3 protein, human)', '0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '4602-84-0 (Farnesol)']",,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,['NIHMS719020'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients received four 21-day cycles of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) (day 1), cladribine 0.10 mg/kg (days 1-3), mitoxantrone 8 mg/m(2) (day 1), and dexamethasone 8 mg/body (days 1-3), with four additional rituximab doses at 4-week intervals. Of the 33 patients, 26 achieved complete response/unconfirmed complete response, and six achieved a partial response (4 with FL, 1 with NMZB, 1 with WM).

Despite the success of this therapy in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, few patients developed leukemia as a major adverse event due to retroviral insertional mutagenesis within stem cells. In experimental animals also, retroviral-mediated gene transfer technique resulted in the development of leukemia. On the other hand, evidence suggests that mature T cells (TC) are relatively resistant to transformation even after retroviral-mediated transfer of potent oncogenes Tcl1, DeltaTrkA and LMO2 with no reported side effects yet. AIMS: To further address the safety issue for TC use in gene therapy, this study investigated susceptibility of mature polyclonal TC to malignant transformation by the retroviral-mediated transfer of nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) oncogene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wild-type mature TC, isolated from C57BL/6 donor mice (genetic background Ly5.1) were transduced with gamma-retroviral vectors encoding the potent TC oncogene NPM-ALK or the control vector enhanced green fluorescent protein eGFP. The cells were then transplanted into RAG-1 deficient recipient mice (genetic background Ly5.2). RESULTS: Two out of five mice from NPM-ALK oncogene group developed leukemia/lymphoma after latency periods (153 and 250 days, respectively). None of the mice from the control group developed any malignancy throughout the observational period. CONCLUSION: Mature polyclonal TC are relatively susceptible to malignant transformation after gamma-retroviral mediated transfer of NPM-ALK oncogene; hence safety of TC use in gene therapy should be further investigated to avoid the possible side-effect of development of leukemia/lymphoma.",,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Alk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, progression through a pluripotent state and subsequent complete differentiation into desired lineages remains a roadblock for the clinical translation of iPSC technology because of the associated neoplastic potential and genomic instability. Recently, we and others showed that somatic cells cannot only be converted into iPSCs but also into different types of multipotent somatic stem cells by using defined factors, thereby circumventing progression through the pluripotent state. In particular, the direct conversion of human fibroblasts into induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs) heralds the possibility of a novel autologous cell source for various applications such as cell replacement, disease modeling and drug screening. Here, we describe the isolation of adult human primary fibroblasts by skin biopsy and their efficient direct conversion into iNPCs by timely restricted expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, as well as c-Myc. Sox2-positive neuroepithelial colonies appear after 17 days of induction and iNPC lines can be established efficiently by monoclonal isolation and expansion. Precise adjustment of viral multiplicity of infection and supplementation of leukemia inhibitory factor during the induction phase represent critical factors to achieve conversion efficiencies of up to 0.2%. Thus far, patient-specific iNPC lines could be expanded for more than 12 passages and uniformly display morphological and molecular features of neural stem/progenitor cells, such as the expression of Nestin and Sox2. The iNPC lines can be differentiated into neurons and astrocytes as judged by staining against TUJ1 and GFAP, respectively. In conclusion, we report a robust protocol for the derivation and direct conversion of human fibroblasts into stably expandable neural progenitor cells that might provide a cellular source for biomedical applications such as autologous neural cell replacement and disease modeling.",,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent adult data suggest the leukemic cells in a subset of patients are dependent on JAK/STAT signaling and harbor CSF3R-activating mutations. We hypothesized that, similar to adult patients, the presence of CSF3R-activating mutations would be clinically relevant in pediatric myeloid neoplasms as patients would be sensitive to the JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib. We report two cases of morphologically similar pediatric aCML, BCR-ABL1-negative based on WHO 2008 criteria. One patient had CSF3R-activating mutation (T618I) and demonstrated a robust response to ruxolitinib, which was used to bridge to a successful stem cell transplant. The other patient did not have a CSF3R-activating mutation and succumbed to refractory disease <6 months from diagnosis. This report documents CSF3R-T618I in pediatric aCML and demonstrates the efficacy of ruxolitinib in a pediatric malignancy.

In this retrospective cohort study, we identified 3712 patients with ATL using national hospital administrative data. Analysed opportunistic infections included Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), tuberculosis, varicella zoster virus (VZV), Cryptococcus spp., nontuberculous mycobacteria, and Strongyloides spp. Multilevel logistic regression analysis for in-hospital mortality and a multilevel linear regression analysis for LOS and TC were employed to determine the impact of opportunistic infections on clinical outcomes and healthcare resources. We found ATL patients infected with CMV had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.29 [1.50-3.49] p < 0.001), longer LOS (coefficient (B): 0.13 [0.06-0.20] p < 0.001) and higher TC (B: 0.25 [0.17-0.32] p < 0.001) than those without CMV.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Sprague Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Alveolar epithelial A549 cell lines were cultured and received bilirubin (from 0 to 160 muM) to explore the protective pathway of dexmedetomidine on bilirubin-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury assessed by immunochemistry and flow cytometry. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to common bile duct ligation surgery to explore the protective effect of dexmedetomidine on hyperbilirubinemia-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury and respiratory failure in comparison with the Sham (subjected to the surgery procedure but without bile duct ligation) or dexmedetomidine control (only received intraperitoneal injection of dexmedetomidine). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In vitro, dexmedetomidine reversed the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), upregulation of cytochrome C, B cell leukemia 2 associated X protein, and cleaved-caspase 3 and 9 in A549 epithelial cells with bilirubin challenge. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine reversed the arrest of cell cycle and the downregulation of the transforming growth factorbeta, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin, and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase induced by bilirubin. In vivo, pulmonary edema and inflammation were found after common bile duct ligation. Bilirubin and PaCO2 were significantly increased, and oxygen (PaO2) was significantly decreased in the blood of common bile duct ligation rats from the postsurgery day 7 to day 21 when compared with those in the sham controls, respectively (p < 0.01). Daily intraperitoneal injection of dexmedetomidine significantly alleviated the lung edema and injury and prevented respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: Our data both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that dexmedetomidine protected alveolar epithelial cell from bilirubin-induced injury.

The prophylactic use of antithrombin infusion (to keep antithrombin activity >60%) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may reduce the risk of VTE. The decision to continue L-asparaginase therapy after the development of VTE should be based on anticipated benefits, severity of VTE and the ability to continue therapeutic anticoagulation. In patients receiving asparaginase rechallenge, the use of therapeutic LMWH, monitoring of anti-Xa level and antithrombin level are important.

In this study, we developed a new sonoporation device designed for spatial and temporal control of ultrasound cavitation. The regulation system incorporated in the device allowed a real-time control of the cavitation level during sonoporation. This device was evaluated for the in vitro transfection efficiency of a plasmid coding for Green Fluorescent Protein (pEGFP-C1) in adherent and non-adherent cell lines. The transfection efficiency of the device was compared to those observed with lipofection and nucleofection methods. In both adherent and non-adherent cell lines, the sonoporation device allowed high rate of transfection of pEGFP-C1 (40-80%), as determined by flow cytometry analysis of GFP expression, along with a low rate of mortality assessed by propidium iodide staining. The transfection efficiency and toxicity of sonoporation on the non-adherent cell lines Jurkat and K562 were similar to those of nucleofection, while these two cell lines were resistant to transfection by lipofection. Moreover, sonoporation was used to produce three stably transfected human lymphoma and leukemia lines. Significant transfection efficiency was also observed in two fresh samples of human acute myeloid leukemia cells. In conclusion, we developed a user-friendly and cost-effective ultrasound device, well adapted for routine in vitro high-yield transfection experiments and which does not require the use of any transfection reagent or gas micro-bubbles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, studies have shown that ATO can induce apoptosis in leukemic cells and blood vessel endothelial cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner through the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) production. VEGFA is a key factor in angiogenesis initiation. Targeted inhibition of VEGF or VEGFA expression can suppress angiogenesis; however, little is known about the mechanism by which ATO inhibits VEGFA expression. In this study, we investigated the role of miRNA-126 in the mechanism of action of ATO in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). ATO significantly decreased the viability and proliferation of HUVECs and decreased their migration at 48 h. Cell proliferation was inhibited by 50% (IC50) when 5.0 mumol/L ATO was used. ATO treatment induced miR-126 upregulation and HUVEC apoptosis. Transfection with a miR-126 mimic significantly downregulated VEGFA mRNA levels, and transfection with a miR-126 inhibitor significantly upregulated VEGFA mRNA levels. Finally, we showed that ATO treatment upregulated Ets-2 and miR-126 expression in HUVECs. These results demonstrate that ATO inhibits the growth of HUVECs and induces apoptosis by downregulating VEGFA. One mechanism by which this occurs is Ets-2 upregulation, which results in an increase in miR-126 levels and downregulation of VEGFA expression.",,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that Stx induced rapid reduction of short-lived anti-apoptotic proteins followed by activation of caspase 9 and the progression of apoptosis. Proteasome inhibitors prevented the reduction of anti-apoptotic proteins, and inhibited caspase activation and apoptosis, suggesting that the reduction of anti-apoptotic proteins is a prerequisite for Stx-induced apoptosis. A clinically approved proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, prolonged the survival of mice challenged by Stx.

However, it is unclear whether this morphological classification reflects clinical outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed bone marrow morphology in 186 children (median age 8 years; range 1-16 years) who were enrolled in the prospective study and received horse antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine between July 1999 and November 2008. The median follow-up period was 87 months (range 1-146 months). Out of 186 patients, 62 (33%) were classified with aplastic anemia, 94 (49%) with refractory cytopenia of childhood, and 34 (18%) with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. Aplastic anemia patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor more frequently and for longer durations than other patients (P<0.01). After six months, response rates to immunosuppressive therapy were not significantly different among the 3 groups. Acquisition of chromosomal abnormalities was observed in 5 patients with aplastic anemia, 4 patients with refractory cytopenia of childhood, and 3 patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. Although the cumulative incidence of total clonal evolution at ten years was not significantly different among the 3 groups, the cumulative incidence of monosomy 7 development was significantly higher in aplastic anemia than in the other groups (P=0.02). Multivariate analysis revealed that only granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration duration of 40 days or more was a significant risk factor for monosomy 7 development (P=0.02).

STAT3 is activated in many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in people. Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is similar to advanced or recurrent HNSCC as it is poorly responsive to traditional therapies and carries a poor long-term prognosis. The purpose of this study was to characterize expression and activation of STAT3 in feline OSCC cell lines and tumor samples and to investigate the biologic activity of a novel, allosteric STAT3 inhibitor, LLL12, in feline OSCC cell lines. RESULTS: We evaluated 3 feline OSCC cell lines and one of these (SCCF2) exhibited high levels of constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation and high sensitivity to LLL12 treatment. Exposure of SCCF2 cells to LLL12 resulted in decreased expression of pSTAT3 and total STAT3, apoptosis as assessed by caspase 3/7 activation, inhibition of colony formation and reduced expression of the STAT3 transcriptional target survivin. In contrast, the STAT3 transcriptional targets VEGF and MCL-1 increased after LLL12 treatment. This was, in part, likely due to LLL12 mediated upregulation of HIF-1alpha, which is known to drive VEGF and MCL-1 expression. The OSCC cell lines with low basal STAT3 phosphorylation did not exhibit these effects, suggesting that STAT3 inhibition was responsible for the observed results. Lastly, immunohistochemistry for pSTAT3 was performed using a feline OSCC tissue microarray, demonstrating expression in 48 % of samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that LLL12 has biologic activity against a feline OSCC cell line expressing pSTAT3 and that STAT3 represents a target for therapeutic intervention in this disease. However, given the up-regulation of several STAT3 transcriptional targets following treatment, further investigation of STAT3 and its related signaling pathways in OSCC is warranted.","['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001070/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR001070/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (LLL12 compound)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF has been shown to regulate trophoblast adhesion and invasion in vitro, however its precise role in vivo is unknown. We hypothesized that LIF would be required for normal placental development in mice. LIF and LIFRalpha were immunolocalized to placental trophoblasts and fetal vessels in mouse implantation sites during mid-gestation. Temporally blocking LIF action during specific periods of placental development via intraperitoneal administration of our specific LIFRalpha antagonist, PEGLA, resulted in abnormal placental trophoblast and vascular morphology and reduced activated STAT3 but not ERK. Numerous genes regulating angiogenesis and oxidative stress were altered in the placenta in response to LIF inhibition. Pregnancy viability was also significantly compromised in PEGLA treated mice. Our data suggest that LIF plays an important role in placentation in vivo and the maintenance of healthy pregnancy.",,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (pegylated MH35-BD-Q29A+G124R protein)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 13.,"BACKGROUND: There has recently been increased interest in cancer incidence in electronics workers. AIMS: To determine the cancer incidence ratio in electronics workers and the potential factors affecting the risk for development of cancer. METHODS: Epidemiological study performed in electronics workers who were employed between 1999 and 2008 in South Korea. Cancer incidence ratio was analysed with respect to departments, divisions, job titles, gender, age, hepatitis B and C virus infection and work duration. We compared the incidence of haematological cancer in this cohort with that expected in the general population. RESULTS: The study population was 56283. Overall, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for haematological cancer was 0.85. In particular, the SIR for leukaemia was 0.86 and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was 0.93, which were not statistically significant. The SIR for NHL was significantly increased [SIR 5.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-20.95] in female office workers. We also found that the SIR for NHL was significantly increased in female workers who tested positive for hepatitis virus infection (SIR 7.69, 95% CI 1.08-54.60). CONCLUSIONS: The raised SIR for NHL among female workers was due to potential risk factors such as hepatitis virus infection although additional research and an ongoing, long-term, prospective epidemiological cohort study is needed.",,,,"['(c) The Author 2015.

METHODS: By ELISA, LTB4 levels were measured in the CSF of the patients with TBM (diagnosed by modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining), cryptococcal meningitis (CM), central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) or non-inflammatory neurological disease (NIND). CSF cytological testing was performed in TBM patients. Disease severity was evaluated by modified Rankin scale (mRS). LTB4 levels were compared between different disease groups, and the relationships of LTB4 level with white blood cell (WBC) counts, neutrophil counts and disease severity were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Compared with CM, CNSL or NIND patients, CSF LTB4 level in TBM patients was remarkably higher. CSF LTB4 level in TBM patients was related to neutrophil counts and neutrophil percentages, but not related to WBC counts. No simple linear correlation was found between CSF LTB4 level and disease severity. CONCLUSION: CSF LTB4 level in TBM patients can be used as a predictor of inflammation degree, but its relationship with disease severity and prognosis need further exploration.",,['1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 14.,"Recombinant interferon-alpha represents a well-established therapeutic option for the treatment of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Recent studies also suggest a role for recombinant interferon-alpha in the treatment of 'early stage' primary myelofibrosis, but few studies have reported the bone marrow changes after clinically successful interferon therapy. The aim of the present study is to detail the histological responses to recombinant interferon-alpha in primary myelofibrosis and post-polycythemia vera/post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis and to correlate these with clinical findings. We retrospectively studied 12 patients with primary myelofibrosis or post-polycythemia vera/post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis, who had been treated with recombinant interferon-alpha. Six patients had received other prior cytoreductive therapies. Bone marrow biopsy was assessed for the following histological parameters: (i) cellularity; (ii) myeloid-to-erythroid ratio; (iii) megakaryocyte tight clusters; (iv) megakaryocyte and naked nuclei density; (v) megakaryocytic atypia; (vi) fibrosis; and (vii) the percentage of blasts. Clinical and laboratory data were included: (i) constitutional symptoms; (ii) splenomegaly, if present; and (iii) complete cell blood count. The clinical response to therapy was evaluated using the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment/European LeukemiaNet response criteria. The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) score was calculated before and after recombinant interferon-alpha administration. Successful interferon therapy for myelofibrosis was associated with a significant reduction of marrow fibrosis, cellularity, megakaryocyte density and naked nuclei density. The presence of JAK2(V617F) mutation correlated with improved DIPSS score. JAK2(V617F)-negative cases showed worsening of such score or evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis documented a normal karyotype in all cases. In conclusion, successful clinical response to interferon-alpha correlates well with an improvement of bone marrow morphology. The prognostic effect of such therapy may be influenced by the JAK2 mutational status. Additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary data.",,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4006-7317'],,,,,,,,

However, the role of LIF in osteosarcoma is still largely unknown. Here, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the expression and biological functions of LIF in osteosarcoma. Compared to that in the non-cancerous tissues, LIF was significantly overexpressed in a panel of 68 osteosarcoma samples (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the overexpression of LIF was significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage, larger tumor size, and shorter overall survival. In addition, knockdown of LIF notably suppressed the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma via blocking the STAT3 signal pathway; in contrast, treatment with the recombinant LIF protein significantly promoted the growth and invasion of osteosarcoma through enhancing the phosphorylation of STAT3, which can be partially neutralized by the STAT3 inhibitor, HO-3867. In conclusion, we demonstrated that LIF was frequently overexpressed in osteosarcoma, which could promote the growth and invasion through activating the STAT3 pathway.

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a disorder of hematopoietic stem cells caused by constitutive activation of the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase. However, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib mesylate are not effective in the patients with advanced-stage of CML. Hence, there is an urgent need for new approaches to overcome a cancer cell's resistance in CML long term therapy. Development of new drug carriers, is presently one of the most challenging tasks in experimental oncology. In this report we investigated whether the toxicity of newly synthetized doxorubicin transferrin conjugate (DOX-TRF) may be connected to the limitation of multidrug resistance in CML cells by the alternations of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The studies were performed on human chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines sensitive (K562) and resistant (K562/DOX) to doxorubicin. Our research proves that DOX-TRF conjugate displays higher cytotoxicity toward both examined cell lines than the reference free drug (DOX) and induces more extensive pro-apoptotic changes. Moreover, by the of engagement of Wnt pathway agonist (LiCl) and antagonist (ICG 001) we demonstrate that DOX-TRF conjugate effectively reduces transcription of key genes involved in beta-catenin signaling transduction trial (Wnt3a, DVL-1, FZD-3, LRP5, beta-catenin, DKK2) and triggers morphology alternations of CML cells.",,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (doxorubicin-transferrin conjugate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has improved the detection of such mutations by identifying small mutated clones but functional method like FASAY (functional assay of separated allele in yeast) may prove interesting. We compared the detection of TP53 mutations by FASAY and NGS in 91 patients with AML or MDS. By FASAY, 91% of assays were evaluable and 47 patients (57%) had a functional and 36 (43%) a non-functional p53 protein. FASAY could not conclude in 8 cases (9%), mainly because of poor RNA quality. No TP53 mutation was found using NGS in 50 cases (55%), and at least one mutation was detected in 41 cases (45%). The p53 status was concordant between FASAY and NGS in 95% (79/83) of cases. The four discordances included mutations detected by FASAY only in two cases, and by NGS only in two cases. Mutations not detected by NGS consisted of insertions in intronic regions, which were not analyzed by this assay. Mutations not detected by FASAY were mutations for which the percentage of mutated allele was less than 10%, including one mutation reported as non-deleterious in the IARC database. Overall, our data suggest that FASAY is an effective and reliable method to detect TP53 mutations in AML and MDS, which allows the assessment of the protein functionality, contrary to a sequencing approach.",,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To identify which of these regimens is better for pediatric patients, we performed a retrospective analysis of nationwide registration data collected in Japan between 2006 and 2011 to assess the outcomes of patients receiving these regimens before a first allo-HCT. Myeloablative conditioning regimens based on i.v. BU (i.v. BU-MAC) (n = 69) or TBI (TBI-MAC) (n = 151) were compared in pediatric AML patients in first or second complete remission (CR1/CR2). The incidences of sinusoid obstruction syndrome, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and early nonrelapse mortality (NRM) before day 100 were similar for both conditioning groups; however, the incidence of bacterial infection during the acute period was higher in the TBI-MAC group (P = .008). Both groups showed a similar incidence of NRM, and there was no significant difference in the incidence of relapse between the groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed no significant differences in the 2-year relapse-free survival rates for the i.v. BU-MAC and TBI-MAC groups in the CR1/CR2 setting (71% versus 67%, P = .36; hazard ratio, .73; 95% CI, .43 to 1.24, respectively). TBI-MAC was no better than i.v.

Epub 2015 Aug 10.,"Long-term survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation requires intact immunosurveillance, which is hampered by lymphoid organ damage associated with conditioning therapy, graft-versus-host disease, and immunosuppression. Our study aimed to identify the mechanisms contributing to sustained low memory B cell numbers after transplantation. Peripheral B and T cell subset recovery and functional marker expression were investigated in 35 acute leukemic patients up to 1 year after transplantation. Apoptosis of B cells after CD40/TLR-9, CD40/BCR, and CD40/BCR/TLR-9-dependent stimulation and drug efflux capacity were analyzed. One half of the patients suffered from infections after day 180. All patients had strongly diminished CD27(+) memory B cells despite already normalized total B cell numbers and fully recovered CD27(-)IgD(-) memory B cells, putatively of extra-follicular origin. Circulating memory follicular helper T cells were reduced in the majority of patients as well. Naive B cells exhibited a decreased expression of CXCR5, which mediates follicular B cell entry. Additionally, a lower HLA-DR expression was found on naive B cells, impairing antigen presentation. Upon CD40/TLR-9-dependent activation, B cells underwent significantly increased apoptosis paralleled by an aberrant up-regulation of Fas-L on activated T cells and Fas on resting B cells. Significantly increased B cell apoptosis was also observed after CD40/BCR and CD40/BCR/TLR-9-dependent activation. Drug efflux capacity of naive B cells was diminished in cyclosporin A-treated patients, additionally contributing to an apoptosis-prone phenotype. We conclude that B cell survival and migration and T cell communication defects are contributing candidates for an impaired germinal center formation of memory B cells after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Follow-up studies should evaluate effectiveness of revaccinations on the cellular level and should address the long-term sequelae of B cell defects after transplantation.",,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CXCR5 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Key informant interviews and focus group studies were used before programming the app. The key informants and focus group members included: caregivers of children with ALL, cancer care physicians and nurses, and software engineers. We found several major challenges faced by caregivers: limited access to evidence-based clinic information, lack of financial and social assistance, deficient communications with doctors or nurses, lack of disease-related knowledge, and inconvenience of tracking treatments and testing results. This feedback was used to develop ""Care Assistant"". This app has eight modules: personal information, treatment tracking, family care, financial and social assistance, knowledge centre, self-assessment questionnaires, interactive platform, and reminders.

While Ngn1 substantially suppresses the activation of the astrogliogenic Jak-Stat pathway, the underlying molecular mechanism was unknown. Here, by employing in vivo and in vitro approaches, we report that Ngn1 binds to the promoter of a brain-enriched microRNA, miR-9, and activates its expression during neurogenesis. Subsequently, our in vitro study showed that miR-9 directly targets mRNAs of Lifr-beta, Il6st (gp130), and Jak1 to down-regulate these critical upstream components of the Jak-Stat pathway, achieving inhibition of Stat phosphorylation and consequently, suppression of astrogliogenesis.

Cessation of L-asparaginase decreases event free survival. Acute pancreatitis is the toxicity that most commonly results in cessation of L-asparaginase. We tested whether serial ultrasound examinations could predict asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP). METHODS: Children (aged 1.0-17.9 years) with childhood ALL treated at the University Hospital Rigshopitalet, Copenhagen, according to the standard or intermediate risk arms of the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol, with PEG-asparaginase of 2 or 6 week intervals, for 30 weeks had their pancreas monitored using serial ultrasound in order to detect early signs of inflammation. RESULTS: Nineteen of 31 eligible patients were included. Three of the included patients developed AAP. None of the patients, including the three patients that developed AAP, had signs of inflammatory edema or pancreas enzymes above three times the upper normal limit prior to AAP. CONCLUSION: We found no signs of inflammatory edema within the pancreas on ultrasound during treatment with PEG-asparginase in our cohort prior to development of AAP or in patients that did not develop AAP.",,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five neuroinvasive Bacillus cereus infections (4 fatal) occurred in hospitalized patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) during a 9-month period, prompting an investigation by infection control and public health officials. Methods. Medical records of case-patients were reviewed and a matched case-control study was performed. Infection control practices were observed. Multiple environmental, food, and medication samples common to AML patients were cultured. Multilocus sequence typing was performed for case and environmental B cereus isolates. Results. All 5 case-patients received chemotherapy and had early-onset neutropenic fevers that resolved with empiric antibiotics. Fever recurred at a median of 17 days (range, 9-20) with headaches and abrupt neurological deterioration. Case-patients had B cereus identified in central nervous system (CNS) samples by (1) polymerase chain reaction or culture or (2) bacilli seen on CNS pathology stains with high-grade B cereus bacteremia. Two case-patients also had colonic ulcers with abundant bacilli on autopsy. No infection control breaches were observed. On case-control analysis, bananas were the only significant exposure shared by all 5 case-patients (odds ratio, 9.3; P = .04). Five environmental or food isolates tested positive for B cereus, including a homogenized banana peel isolate and the shelf of a kitchen cart where bananas were stored. Multilocus sequence typing confirmed that all case and environmental strains were genetically distinct. Multilocus sequence typing-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that the organisms clustered in 2 separate clades. Conclusions. The investigation of this neuroinvasive B cereus cluster did not identify a single point source but was suggestive of a possible dietary exposure. Our experience underscores the potential virulence of B cereus in immunocompromised hosts.","['K08 CA184420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007061/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As vertebrates, fish have great anatomic and biologic similarity to humans, including their hematopoietic and immune systems. As an experimental platform, D. rerio offer many advantages that mammalian models lack. These include their ease of genetic manipulation, capacity for imaging, and suitability for large-scale phenotypic and drug screens. In this review, we present examples of these strategies and others to illustrate how zebrafish have been and can be used to study leukemia. Besides appraising the techniques researchers apply and introducing the leukemia models they have created, we also highlight recent and exciting discoveries made using D. rerio with an eye to where the field is likely headed.",['P20 GM103636/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['NIHMS710001'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IKZF1 deletions occur in 10-15% of Ph(-) ALL cases, effects of IKZF1 deletions on signaling pathways in this group have not been extensively studied. Therefore, in this study we aimed to study the effect of IKZF1 deletions on active signal transduction pathways. METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to determine IKZF1 deletions and other copy number alterations in 109 pediatric B-Cell Precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patients. Kinase activity profiling of 45 primary Ph(-) BCP-ALL patients (31 IKZF1 wild type patients and 14 patients harboring an IKZF1 alteration) and western blot analysis of 14 pediatric BCP-ALL samples was performed to determine active signal transduction pathways. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of kinome profiles of 45 pediatric Ph(-) ALL cases showed no clustering based on IKZF1 status. Comparing the phosphorylation intensities of peptides associated with signaling pathways known to be involved in BCP-ALL maintenance, we did not observe differences between the two groups. Western blot analysis of 14 pediatric BCP-ALL samples showed large variations in phosphorylation levels between the different ALL samples, independent of IKZF1 status. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results we conclude that, although IKZF1 deletions appear to be an important clinical prognostic factor, we were unable to identify a unique IKZF1 dependent protein expression signature in pediatric Ph(-) ALL and consequently no specific targets for future therapy of Ph(-) IKZF1 deleted BCP-ALL could be identified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to assess GPX3 expression. GPX3 promoter was significantly methylated in AML patients compared with normal controls (P=0.022). The patients with GPX3 methylation presented significantly older age than those with GPX3 unmethylation (P=0.011). GPX3 methylated patients had significantly lower frequency of C/EBPA mutation and higher incidence of FLT3-ITD mutation (P=0.037 and 0.030, respectively). The non-M3 patients with GPX3 methylation had significantly lower overall survival than those with GPX3 unmethylation (P=0.036). No significant correlation was observed between GPX3 expression and its promoter methylation (R=0.110, P=0.284). However, GPX3 mRNA level was significantly increased after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment in leukemic cell line THP1. Our data suggest that GPX3 methylation predicts adverse clinical outcome in non-M3 AML patients. Moreover, GPX3 expression is regulated by its promoter methylation in leukemic cell line THP1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Oct 01;6(10 ):2389. PMID: 27822430'],,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"Metabolic changes that contribute to differentiation are not well understood. Overwhelming evidence shows the critical role of glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) in directing metabolism of proliferating cells. However, its role in metabolism of differentiating cells is unclear. Here we studied the role of PK in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation in human leukemia K562 cells. We observed that PMA treatment decreased cancer-type anabolic metabolism but increased ATP production, along with up-regulated expression of two PK isoforms (PKM2 and PKR) in an ERK2-dependent manner. Interestingly, silencing of PK (PKM2 and PKR) inhibited PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation, as revealed by decreased expression of megakaryocytic differentiation marker CD61 and cell cycle behavior. Further, PMA-induced ATP production reduced greatly upon PK silencing, suggesting that PK is required for ATP synthesis. In addition to metabolic effects, PMA treatment also translocated PKM2, but not PKR, into nucleus. ERK1/2 knockdowns independently and together suggested the role of ERK2 in the up-regulation of both the isoforms of PK, proposing a role of ERK2-PK isoform axis in differentiation. Collectively, our findings unravel ERK2 guided PK-dependent metabolic changes during PMA induction, which are important in megakaryocytic differentiation.",,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (ITGB3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', 'EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,"['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the activation mechanism of the NF-kappaB pathways remains poorly understood. Recently, we reported that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway by promoting the active dephosphorylated form of PTEN at its C-terminus via the recruitment of PP2A. Additionally, the down-regulation of NDRG2 expression promotes the inactive phosphorylated form of PTEN, which results in constitutively active PI3K/AKT signaling in various cancer cell types. Here, we investigated the involvement of NDRG2 in modulating NF-kappaB signaling. The forced expression of NDRG2 in ATL cells down-regulates not only the canonical pathway by inhibiting AKT signaling but also the non-canonical pathway by inducing NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) dephosphorylation via the recruitment of PP2A. Therefore, NDRG2 works as a PP2A recruiter to suppress not only PI3K/AKT signaling but also NF-kappaB signaling, which is particularly important in host defenses or immune responses to Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Furthermore, the loss of NDRG2 expression might play an important role in the progression of tumor development after HTLV-1 infection.",,"['0 (NDRG2 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"UNLABELLED: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected CD4(+) T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) are present in peripheral blood from HTLV-1 carriers. While T-cell infection requires cell-cell contact, DCs might be infected with cell-free virus, at least in vitro. However, a thorough comparison of the susceptibilities of the two cell types to HTLV-1 infection using cell-associated and cell-free viral sources has not been performed. We first determined that human primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) were more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than their autologous lymphocyte counterparts after contact with chronically infected cells. Next, a comparison of infection efficiency using nonconcentrated or concentrated supernatants from infected cells as well as purified viral biofilm was performed. Integrated provirus was found after exposure of MDDCs or primary lymphocytes to viral biofilm but not to a viral supernatant. Using a large series of primary cell samples (n = 21), we demonstrated a higher proviral load in MDDCs exposed to viral biofilm than in lymphocytes. This higher susceptibility is correlated to a higher expression of neuropilin-1 on MDDCs than on autologous activated T lymphocytes. Moreover, we show that MDDCs infected with viral biofilm can transmit the virus to lymphocytes. In conclusion, MDDCs are more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than autologous lymphocytes in vitro, supporting a model in which DC infection might represent an important step during primo-infection in vivo. IMPORTANCE: HTLV-1 is able to infect several cell types, but viral DNA is mainly found in T lymphocytes in vivo. This supports a model in which T lymphocytes are the main target of infection. However, during the primo-infection of new individuals, incoming viruses might first encounter dendritic cells (DCs), the specialized immune cells responsible for the antiviral response of the host. HTLV-1 cell-free purified viruses can infect dendritic cells in vitro, while T-cell infection is restricted to cell-to-cell transmission. In order to understand the sequence of HTLV-1 dissemination, we undertook a direct comparison of the susceptibilities of the two cell types using cell-associated and cell-free viral sources. We report here that MDDCs are more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than autologous lymphocytes in vitro and are able to efficiently transmit the virus to lymphocytes. Our results suggest that DCs may represent a true viral reservoir, as the first cell type to be infected in vivo.",,['144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)'],,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Its most common chromosomal aberration is the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, with ~25% of ETV6-RUNX1 patients also carrying PAX5 alterations. METHODS: We have recreated this mutation background by inter-crossing Etv6-RUNX1 (Etv6 (RUNX1-SB)) and Pax5(+/-) mice and performed an in vivo analysis to find driver genes using Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated mutagenesis and also exome sequencing. RESULTS: Combination of Etv6-RUNX1 and Pax5(+/-) alleles generated a transplantable B220 + CD19+ B-ALL with a significant disease incidence. RNA-seq analysis showed a gene expression pattern consistent with arrest at the pre-B stage. Analysis of the transposon common insertion sites identified genes involved in B-cell development (Zfp423) and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Jak1, Stat5 and Il2rb), while exome sequencing revealed somatic hotspot mutations in Jak1 and Jak3 at residues analogous to those mutated in human leukemias, and also mutation of Trp53.

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"Elevated levels of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) have been implicated in many tumor types, and mitogen activated protein kinase-interacting kinases (Mnks) are the only known kinases that phosphorylate eIF4E at Ser209. The phosphorylation of eIF4E is essential for oncogenic transformation but is of no significance to normal growth and development. Pharmacological inhibition of Mnks therefore provides a nontoxic and effective strategy for cancer therapy. However, a lack of specific Mnk inhibitors has confounded pharmacological target validation and clinical development. Herein, we report the identification of a novel series of Mnk inhibitors and their binding modes. A systematic workflow has been established to distinguish between type III and type I/II inhibitors. A selection of 66 compounds was tested for Mnk1 and Mnk2 inhibition, and 9 out of 20 active compounds showed type III interaction with an allosteric site of the proteins. Most of the type III inhibitors exhibited dual Mnk1 and Mnk2 activities and demonstrated potent antiproliferative properties against the MV4-11 acute myeloid leukemia cell line. Interestingly, ATP-/substrate-competitive inhibitors were found to be highly selective for Mnk2, with little or no activity for Mnk1. Our study suggests that Mnk1 and Mnk2 share a common structure of the allosteric inhibitory binding site but possess different structural features of the ATP catalytic domain. The findings will assist in the future design and development of Mnk targeted anticancer therapeutics.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MKNK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (MKNK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the serum and urine fetuin-A in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) children during and after high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX). METHODS: Twenty-two ALL children and 20 matched healthy controls were included. Liver transaminases, serum creatinine, estimated glomular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine clearance (CrCl), serum beta2 microglobulin (B2M), and serum and urine fetuin-A levels were assayed pre and 4 months after the consolidation. Among a subgroup of 15 patients, the investigations were performed 42 hours after the start of the second and the fourth HDMTX infusions. RESULTS: HDMTX was well tolerated. During HDMTX, there was significant decline in serum fetuin-A together with significant rise of urine fetuin-A and B2M levels compared to the control and to the pre-consolidation levels, changes that persisted 4 months after the consolidation despite recovery of the significantly altered renal functions. The second HDMTX-related serum fetuin-A level directly correlated with eGFR and CrCl (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001 and r = 0.67, P = 0.016, respectively). Four months after consolidation, urine fetuin-A directly correlated with serum creatinine (r = 0.54, P = 0.004) and inversely correlated with the eGFR (r = -0.66, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Significant disturbance in serum and urinary fetuin-A levels, which was related to renal functions, had occurred during HDMTX and persisted for at least 4 months after the consolidation. Serum and urine fetuin-A could be sensitive markers for subtle renal dysfunction in ALL children.",,"['0 (AHSG protein, human)', '0 (alpha-2-HS-Glycoprotein)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 18.,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous non-mycosis fungoides non-Sezary syndrome T/NK cell lymphomas (non-MF/non-SS CTCL) are rare. In 2005, a consensus of the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classifications for primary cutaneous lymphomas was established. These guidelines were then adopted into the WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, 2008. This study aims to assess the applicability of the WHO 2008 classification in a retrospective series of CTCL cases registered in a reference academic center in Brazil. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with non-MF/non-SS CTCL were studied. Clinical, histopathological and immunophenotypical features based on an extensive panel of antibodies were applied to classify the cases according to the WHO, 2008. RESULTS: Overall, diagnostic categories included eight (29.6%) cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, five (18.5%) lymphomatoid papulosis, six (22.2%) extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, five (18.5%) adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, one (3.7%) cutaneous CD8-positive aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma and two (7.4%) of peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (NOS). CONCLUSIONS: The WHO classification (2008) was applicable to most cases of non-MF/non-SS CTCL, while some cases remained unclassified and were considered NOS-peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

EZH2, one of the components of Polycomb group proteins (PRC2) complex, catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 that is associated with transcriptional repression and tumor development. METHODS: We examined the expression levels of PRC2 complex in primary samples of T cells ALL at diagnosis by western blotting and real time PCR. We evaluated the effect of 3-deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an EZH2 inhibitor, alone and in combination with Daunoblastine on cell viability, apoptotic death and cell cycle distribution of T cell established Jurkat cell line. RESULTS: EZH2 was expressed in 75 % samples at different extents mainly with high expression level. SUZ12 was expressed in 60 % samples and EED in all samples, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that T-ALL expressing EZH2 had a lower probability of disease-free survival (DFS) compared to T-ALL negative for EZH2 (23 % vs 100 %) (p = 0.01). The EZH2 inhibitor DZNep used in combination with Daunoblastine was synergistic in inducing growth inhibition and increasing the apoptosis in T-ALL Jurkat cells at 48 and 72 h paralleled by EZH2 decreased expression.

The goal of this study was to evaluate acceptance of the diet by patients with haematological cancer throughout their hospital stay for chemotherapeutic treatment. METHOD: this was a cross-sectional, descriptive, quantitative study, carried out from February to October 2014 in adult patients of both genders diagnosed with lymphoma and leukaemia. Food intake was evaluated on a daily basis through a recording instrument designed by the author. ANOVA test for repeated measurements was employed. RESULTS: 32 patients were evaluated, with a mean age of 42 +/- 11 years, the majority of whom were women (66%). We observed gastrointestinal disturbances in 72% of the patients, most commonly nausea (59%), followed by xerostomia (34%), vomiting (28%) and dysgeusia (25%). The percentage of leftover food was significant, varying from 23% to 35%. Lunch and dinner were the most frequently rejected meals. Light meals were more well-tolerated, having been accepted in 75% to 100% of the offers. CONCLUSION: The food records show that during chemotherapy cycles, patients present significant food rejection, specially with larger meals such as lunch and dinner, though light meals are better tolerated. Employing food options chosen by patients may be a strategy to improve dietary acceptance. More studies on this subject are necessary in order to improve nutritional care to this population, aiming to prevent and/or rehabilitate the nutritional status of these patients.",,,,"['Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

In this study, 31 hit candidates were selected from nearly 800,000 database compounds in a ligand-based virtual screening campaign. In turn, three of these hits were found to have (sub)micromolar potencies in proliferation assays with the Jurkat acute lymphatic leukemic cell line. In this assay, the three hits were found to exhibit higher potency than clinically tested cell-death inducers (GDC-0152, AT-406, and birinapant). Importantly, antiproliferative activity toward non-cancer peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was found to be marginal. Further biological characterization demonstrated the cell-death-inducing properties of these compounds. Biological testing of hit congeners excluded a nonspecific, toxic effect of the novel structures.

METHODS: A 36-year-old man with history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia on treatment presented with decreased vision and optic nerve leukemic infiltrates. RESULTS: At presentation, ocular examination revealed decreased visual acuity at hand movement close to face in his right eye and 20/120 in his left eye. Fundus examination showed a pale optic disk with blurred margins and multiple flame-shaped and dot and blot retinal hemorrhages in his right eye and disk edema with whitish leukemic infiltrates over it with few dot and blot retinal hemorrhages in his left eye. The patient was referred to the treating oncologist, and curative orbital radiotherapy was administered. Vision improved dramatically to 20/40 in the right eye and to 20/20 in the left eye. He again reported with complaints of blurring of vision in the left eye after 1 month. Visual acuity was 20/20, but fundus revealed severe disk edema with whitish leukemic infiltrates. We diagnosed as relapse of leukemic optic nerve infiltration and referred to the treating oncologist for further management. CONCLUSION: Isolated optic nerve relapse of leukemic infiltration is of paramount importance to early diagnosis, as vision can be saved if treatment is initiated promptly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The algorithm employs a novel Progeny Sampling method to reconstruct cluster identity, a co-occurrence probability matrix to assess the clustering stability, and a set of reference datasets to overcome inherent biases in the algorithm and data space. Our method was shown successful and robust when applied to two synthetic datasets (datasets of two-dimensions and ten-dimensions containing eight dimensions of pure noise), two standard biological datasets (the Iris dataset and Rat CNS dataset) and two biological datasets (a cell phenotype dataset and an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) reverse phase protein array (RPPA) dataset). Progeny Clustering outperformed some popular clustering evaluation methods in the ten-dimensional synthetic dataset as well as in the cell phenotype dataset, and it was the only method that successfully discovered clinically meaningful patient groupings in the AML RPPA dataset.",['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each month, patients could move from stable to disease event or die from either state. After a disease event, patients discontinued initial treatment and switched to the other regimen as second-line therapy. Treatment regimens, efficacy and adverse events were derived from published sources and expert opinion; unit costs were collected from standard Italian sources. Clinical outcomes and costs for pre-ATO and post-ATO scenarios were combined with population and product utilization information to calculate the total budgetary impact using a 3-year time horizon; one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. Three-year cumulative pharmacy costs for ATO+ATRA were euro46,700 per-patient versus euro6,500 for ATRA+chemotherapy; however, medical costs for ATO+ATRA were euro12,300 per-patient versus euro30,200 for ATRA+chemotherapy. The total budgetary impact was estimated to be an additional euro127,300, euro312,500 and euro477,800 in the first, second and third years, respectively. The model was most sensitive to changes in the cost of the ATO+ATRA regimen during the consolidation phase. Budgetary impact models are valuable to payers making formulary decisions regarding the access and affordability of new medicines. The cost of treatment analysis showed that pharmacy costs for ATO+ATRA were higher than for ATRA+chemotherapy, while all other evaluated costs were lower for ATO+ATRA treated patients. The average budgetary impact was euro305,900 per year overall, representing a 3.5% increase. Further research is needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of ATO+ATRA compared to the current first-line standard of care in APL.",,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the properties of the induced LGLs, we performed prospective and longitudinal analyses. From Feb 2011 to Jan 2013, a total of 17 patients with Ph-positive leukemia who were previously untreated or refractory to imatinib were enrolled. T cell receptor (TCR)-gamma/delta gene rearrangements and phenotypic profiles of lymphocytes were examined before and during administration of dasatinib. LGL lymphocytosis was observed in half of the dasatinib-treated cases (LGL+ group), showing a relation to increased achievement of complete cytogenetic response within 6 months. The phenotypes of the increased lymphocytes were revealed to be mostly natural killer cells. In the LGL+ group, clonal TCR-gamma gene rearrangements were frequently detected at diagnosis (six of nine cases) and persisted during therapy, compared with only two of eight in the LGL- group. The proportion of regulatory T cells to CD4+ T cells at diagnosis was lower in the LGL+ compared with the LGL- group (median 4.2 vs. 6.6 %), and this disparity was sustained throughout the therapeutic period. These results demonstrate that immunological condition at diagnosis may affect LGL lymphocytosis in some dasatinib-treated patients.",,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9309-7902'],,,,,,,,

Overexpression and deregulated proteolytic activity of Separase as frequently observed in human cancers is associated with the occurrence of supernumerary centrosomes, chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy. Recently, we have hypothesized that increased Separase proteolytic activity in a small subpopulation of tumor cells may serve as driver of tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Currently, there is no quantitative assay to measure Separase activity levels in single cells. Therefore, we have designed a flow cytometry-based assay that utilizes a Cy5- and rhodamine 110 (Rh110)-biconjugated Rad21 cleavage site peptide ([Cy5-D-R-E-I-M-R]2-Rh110) as smart probe and intracellular substrate for detection of Separase enzyme activity in living cells. As measured by Cy5 fluorescence the cellular uptake of the fluorogenic peptide was fast and reached saturation after 210 min of incubation in human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells. Separase activity was recorded as the intensity of Rh110 fluorescence released after intracellular peptide cleavage providing a linear signal gain within a 90-180 min time slot. Compared to conventional cell extract-based methods the flow cytometric assay delivers equivalent results but is more reliable, bypasses the problem of vague loading controls and unspecific proteolysis associated with whole cell extracts. Especially suited for the investigaton of blood- and bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells the flow cytometric Separase assay allows generation of Separase activity profiles that tell about the number of Separase positive cells within a sample i.e. cells that currently progress through mitosis and about the range of intercellular variation in Separase activity levels within a cell population. The assay was used to quantify Separase proteolytic activity in leukemic cell lines and peripheral blood samples from leukemia patients.",,['EC 3.4.22.49 (Separase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, some therapeutic strategies suggest that pharmacologically shifting cancer cells towards an oxidative phenotype, using glycolysis inhibitors, may reduce cancer aggressiveness. Given the metabolic parallels between cancer and stemness would chemotherapeutical agents have an effect on pluripotency, and could a strategy involving these agents be envisioned to modulate stem cell fate in an accessible manner? In this manuscript we attempted to determine the effects of 3-bromopyruvate (3BrP) in pluripotency. Although it has other intracellular targets, this compound is a potent inhibitor of glycolysis enzymes thought to be important to maintain a glycolytic profile. The goal was also to determine if we could contribute towards a pharmacologically accessible metabolic strategy to influence cell differentiation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) grown under standard pluripotency conditions (in the presence of Leukemia Inducing Factor- LIF) were treated with 3BrP. As a positive control for differentiation other mESCs were grown without LIF. Overall our results demonstrate that 3BrP negatively affects pluripotency, forcing cells to become less glycolytic and with more active mitochondria. These changes in metabolism are correlated with increased differentiation, even under pluripotency conditions (i.e. in the presence of LIF). However, 3BrP also significantly impaired cell function, and may have other roles besides affecting the metabolic profile of mESCs. CONCLUSIONS/FINDINGS: Treatment of mESCs with 3BrP triggered a metabolic switch and loss of pluripotency, even in the presence of LIF. Interestingly, the positive control for differentiation allowed for a distinction between 3BrP effects and changes associated with spontaneous differentiation/loss of pluripotency in the absence of LIF. Additionally, there was a slight differentiation bias towards mesoderm in the presence of 3BrP. However, the side effects on cellular function suggest that the use of this drug is probably not adequate to efficiently push cells towards specific differentiation fates.",,"['0 (Pyruvates)', '63JMV04GRK (bromopyruvate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

important role in leukemogenesis in pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The most common FOs are BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, ETV6-RUNX1, and TCF3-PBX1, all of which have important prognostic and drug selection implications. Moreover, frequencies of FOs have ethnic variations. We studied Pakistani frequencies of FOs, clinical pattern, and outcome in pediatric B-ALL. METHODS: FOs were studied in 188 patients at diagnosis using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: FOs were detected in 87.2 % of patients. Mean overall survival was 70.9 weeks, 3-year survival was 31.9 %, and 3-year relapse-free survival was 18.1 %. Four patients died of drug toxicities. ETV6-RUNX1 (19.14 %) had better survival (110.9 weeks; p = 0.03); TCF3-PBX1 (2.1 %) was associated with inferior outcome and higher central nervous system (CNS) relapse risk; MLL-AF4 (18.1 %) was more common in the 8- to 15-year age group (24/34; p = 0.001) and was associated with organomegaly, low platelet count, and poor survival; and BCR-ABL (47.9 %) was associated with older age (7-15 years, 52/90), lower remission rates, shorter survival (43.73 +/- 4.24 weeks) and higher white blood cell count. Overall, MLL-AF4 and BCR-ABL were detected in 66 % of B-ALL, presented in later childhood, and were associated with poor prognosis and inferior survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the highest ethnic frequency of BCR-ABL FO in pediatric ALL, and is consistent with previous reports from our region. Poor prognosis BCR-ABL and MLL-AF4 was detected in two-thirds of pediatric B-ALL and is likely to be the reason for the already reported poor survival of childhood ALL in South-East Asia.

Therefore, it seems to be crucial to explore coping resources for the experienced risk condition. In this sense, the study focuses on coping strategies and locus of control in children with ALL during the treatment phase, and on their possible relation. The correlation between children and maternal coping strategies is also investigated. The participants involved were an experimental group of 40 children with ALL and their mothers, and 30 healthy children as the control group. The tools used were: the Child Behavioral Style Scale and the Monitor-Blunter Style Scale to assess the coping strategies of children and mothers; the locus of Control Scale for Children to analyze the children's perception of controlling the events. Both children with ALL and their mothers resorted to monitoring coping strategies with a statistically significant rate of occurrence (children: M=17.8, SD=3.8; mothers: M=10.48, SD=3.4). The data concerning the locus of control show this tendency towards internal causes (M=53.1, SD=4.7). There were statistically significant correlations between monitoring coping strategies and external locus of control (r=0.400, P<0.05). The results gained from the control group are almost equivalent. The outcomes show several interesting resources of the psychological functioning of children as well as of their mothers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the significance of PGI2 in human breast cancer, we performed immunohistochemistry to analyze expression of prostacyclin-synthase (PGIS) in 248 human breast cancer specimens obtained from surgical pathology files. We examined patients' 10-year survival retrospectively by sending a questionnaire to their general practitioners and performed univariate analysis to determine whether PGIS expression correlated with patient survival. Lastly, the effects of PGI2 and its analogues on cell death were examined in a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and a human T-cell leukemia cell line (CCRF-CEM). PGIS expression was observed in tumor cells in 48.7% of samples and was associated with a statistically significant reduction in 10-year survival (P = 0.038; n = 193). Transient transfection of PGIS into MCF-7 cells exposed to sulindac increased cell viability by 50% and exposure to carbaprostacyclin protected against sulindac sulfone induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells. Expression of PGIS is correlated with a reduced patient survival and protects against cell death in vitro, suggesting that PGIS is a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.",,"['184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 5.3.- (Intramolecular Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 5.3.99.4 (prostacyclin synthetase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 11.,"Glucocorticoids are important therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and their major adverse effect is osteonecrosis. Our goal was to identify genetic and nongenetic risk factors for osteonecrosis. We performed a genome-wide association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a discovery cohort comprising 2285 children with ALL, treated on the Children's Oncology Group AALL0232 protocol (NCT00075725), adjusting for covariates. The minor allele at SNP rs10989692 (near the glutamate receptor GRIN3A locus) was associated with osteonecrosis (hazard ratio = 2.03; P = 3.59 x 10(-7)). The association was supported by 2 replication cohorts, including 361 children with ALL on St. Jude's Total XV protocol (NCT00137111) and 309 non-ALL patients from Vanderbilt University's BioVU repository treated with glucocorticoids (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87 and 2.26; P = .063 and .0074, respectively). In a meta-analysis, rs10989692 was also highest ranked (P = 2.68 x 10(-8)), and the glutamate pathway was the top ranked pathway (P = 9.8 x 10(-4)). Osteonecrosis-associated glutamate receptor variants were also associated with other vascular phenotypes including cerebral ischemia (OR = 1.64; P = 2.5 x 10(-3)), and arterial embolism and thrombosis (OR = 1.88; P = 4.2 x 10(-3)). In conclusion, osteonecrosis was associated with inherited variations near glutamate receptor genes. Further understanding this association may allow interventions to decrease osteonecrosis. These trials are registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00075725 and #NCT00137111.","['UL1 TR000445/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007569/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 LM010685/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-LM010685/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HG004603/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2 GM092618/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1-TR000445/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HG04603/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 92666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2-GM092618/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5T32-GM007569/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (GRIN3A protein, human)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",['Blood. 2015 Oct 8;126(15):1734-5.

Epub 2015 Aug 11.,"Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is an ATPase that alters the phasing of nucleosomes on DNA and has recently been implicated in DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair. Here, we show that depletion of CHD4 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts induces a global relaxation of chromatin that renders cells more susceptible to DSB formation, while concurrently impeding their repair. Furthermore, CHD4 depletion renders AML blasts more sensitive both in vitro and in vivo to genotoxic agents used in clinical therapy: daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (ara-C). Sensitization to DNR and ara-C is mediated in part by activation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated pathway, which is preliminarily activated by a Tip60-dependent mechanism in response to chromatin relaxation and further activated by genotoxic agent-induced DSBs. This sensitization preferentially affects AML cells, as CHD4 depletion in normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors does not increase their susceptibility to DNR or ara-C. Unexpectedly, we found that CHD4 is necessary for maintaining the tumor-forming behavior of AML cells, as CHD4 depletion severely restricted the ability of AML cells to form xenografts in mice and colonies in soft agar. Taken together, these results provide evidence for CHD4 as a novel therapeutic target whose inhibition has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of genotoxic agents used in AML therapy.","['R01 CA 67708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 NS047463/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR000058/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 NS047463/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK029902/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK 29902/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CHD4 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['GEO/GSE71865'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it became increasingly clear that CLL cells undergo, during their life, iterative cycles of re-activation and subsequent clonal expansion. Drugs interfering with CLL cell cycle entry would be greatly beneficial in the treatment of this disease. 1, 1-Dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride (metformin), the most widely prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent, inexpensive and well tolerated, has recently received increased attention for its potential antitumor activity. We wondered whether metformin has apoptotic and anti-proliferative activity on leukemic cells derived from CLL patients. Metformin was administered in vitro either to quiescent cells or during CLL cell activation stimuli, provided by classical co-culturing with CD40L-expressing fibroblasts. At doses that were totally ineffective on normal lymphocytes, metformin induced apoptosis of quiescent CLL cells and inhibition of cell cycle entry when CLL were stimulated by CD40-CD40L ligation. This cytostatic effect was accompanied by decreased expression of survival- and proliferation-associated proteins, inhibition of signaling pathways involved in CLL disease progression and decreased intracellular glucose available for glycolysis.

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"We previously found that tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) signaling through its downstream effector phospho-STAT1 acts to upregulate BCL2, which in turn mediates aberrant survival of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. Here we show that pharmacologic inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) with a small-molecule inhibitor, NVP-AUY922 (AUY922), leads to rapid degradation of TYK2 and apoptosis in T-ALL cells. STAT1 protein levels were not affected by AUY922 treatment, but phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701) levels rapidly became undetectable, consistent with a block in signaling downstream of TYK2. BCL2 expression was downregulated after AUY922 treatment, and although this effect was necessary for AUY922-induced apoptosis, it was not sufficient because many T-ALL cell lines were resistant to ABT-199, a specific inhibitor of BCL2. Unlike ABT-199, AUY922 also upregulated the proapoptotic proteins BIM and BAD, whose increased expression was required for AUY922-induced apoptosis. Thus, the potent cytotoxicity of AUY922 involves the synergistic combination of BCL2 downregulation coupled with upregulation of the proapoptotic proteins BIM and BAD. This two-pronged assault on the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery identifies HSP90 inhibitors as promising drugs for targeting the TYK2-mediated prosurvival signaling axis in T-ALL cells.","['P01 CA109901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA176746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA176746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01CA109901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U48 DP005014/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States']","['0', '(5-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropylphenyl)-4-(4-morpholin-4-ylmethylphenyl)isoxazole-3-', 'carboxylic acid ethylamide)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Resorcinols)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)']",,,,,['NIHMS713204'],,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1621-4954'],,,,,,,,

More recently, a targeted approach to MM treatment has emerged, using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to target antigens expressed on the surface of MM cells. MAbs tested to date kill MM cells via the host's immune system and/or by promoting apoptosis, and appear to have generally improved tolerability compared with currently available treatments. Due to their distinct mode of action, mAbs are promising both for patients who have exhausted current regimens, and as part of first-line treatments in newly diagnosed patients.

The high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) treatment is very effective in ALL, and it can improve event-free survival rate. However, while executing the anti-tumor effect, it produces highly toxic effects on rapidly dividing cells which are normal. It seems probable that the HDMTX treatment injures intestinal mucosal barrier. The changes of intestinal mucosal barrier can be evaluated through measuring the level of plasma endotoxin and diamine oxidase (DAO). METHOD: Blood samples were collected from 30 normal children and 30 children with ALL at 1h, 24h, 44h and 68h after HDMTX. The levels of plasma endotoxin and DAO were measured at 1h, 24h, 44h and 68h after HDMTX with spectrophotometry. The levels of endotoxin and DAO were also measured in 4 different courses in 7 children with ALL. RESULTS: The levels of plasma endotoxin and DAO at 1h, 24h, 44h and 68h after HDMTX were higher than in normal children (P<0.01). The levels of plasma endotoxin and DAO at 24h and 44h after HDMTX were both higher than at 1h and 68h (P<0.01). There was no significant difference found in the measured results of plasma endotoxin and DAO at 1h and 68h after HDMTX (P>0.05). There was no significant difference found in the increased levels of endotoxin and DAO at 1h, 24h, 44h and 68h after HDMTX in 4 different courses of 7 children with ALL(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: By measuring the level of plasma endotoxin and DAO in children with ALL and during HDMTX chemotherapy, the results suggest that there is increased intestinal permeability.",,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Endotoxins)', 'EC 1.4.3.21 (Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms of transformation in ATLL have not been fully elucidated. However, genomic instability and cumulative DNA damage during the long period of latency is believed to be essential for HTLV-1 induced leukemogenesis. In addition, constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway was found to be a critical determinant for transformation. Whether a connection exists between NF-kappaB activation and accumulation of DNA damage is not clear. We recently found that the HTLV-1 viral oncoprotein, Tax, the activator of the NF-kappaB pathway, induces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). RESULTS: Here, we investigated whether any of the NF-kappaB target genes are critical in inducing DSBs. Of note, we found that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) that catalyzes the production of nitric oxide (NO) in macrophages, neutrophils and T-cells is over expressed in HTLV-1 infected and Tax-expressing cells. Interestingly, we show that in HTLV-1 infected cells, iNOS expression is Tax-dependent and specifically requires the activation of the classical NF-kappaB and JAK/STAT pathways. A dramatic reduction of DSBs was observed when NO production was inhibited, indicating that Tax induces DSBs through the activation of NO synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of the impact of NO on HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis opens a new area for treatment or prevention of ATLL and perhaps other cancers in which NO is produced.","['P50 CA094056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0', '(N-(6-bromo-7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl)methoxycarbonyl-N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)aceta', 'mide)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the course of treatment, 20-30% of CML patients develop TKI resistance, which is commonly attributed to point mutations in the drug-binding region. We design a new class of peptide inhibitors that target the substrate-binding site of BCR-ABL by grafting sequences derived from abltide, the optimal substrate of Abl kinase, onto a cell-penetrating cyclotide MCoTI-II. Three grafted cyclotides show significant Abl kinase inhibition in vitro in the low micromolar range using a novel kinase inhibition assay. Our work also demonstrates that a reengineered MCoTI-II with abltide sequences grafted in both loop 1 and 6 inhibits the activity of [T315I]Abl in vitro, a mutant Abl kinase harboring the ""gatekeeper"" mutation which is notorious for being multidrug resistant. Results from serum stability and cell internalization studies confirm that the MCoTI-II scaffold provides enzymatic stability and cell-penetrating properties to the lead molecules. Taken together, our study highlights that reengineered cyclotides incorporating abltide-derived sequences are promising substrate-competitive inhibitors for Abl kinase and the T315I mutant.",,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"The effect of high doses of intravenous (sodium) ascorbate (ASC) in the treatment of cancer has been controversial although there is growing evidence that ASC in high (pharmacologic) concentrations induces dose-dependent pro-apoptotic death of tumor cells, in vitro. Very few data are available on the role of ASC in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ascorbate behaves as an antioxidant at low (physiologic), and as pro-oxidant at pharmacologic, concentrations, and this may account for the differences reported in different experimental settings, when human myeloid cell lines, such as HL60, were treated with ASC. Considering the myeloid origin of HL60 cells, and previous literature reports showing that some cell lines belonging to the myeloid lineage could be sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of high concentrations of ASC, we investigated in more details the effects of high doses (0.5 to 7 mM) of ASC in vitro, on a variety of human myeloid cell lines including the following: HL60, U937, NB4, NB4-R4 (retinoic acid [RA]-resistant), NB4/AsR (ATO-resistant) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived cell lines, and K562 as well as on normal CD34+ progenitors derived from human cord blood. Our results indicate that all analyzed cell lines including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)- and arsenic trioxide (ATO)-resistant ones are highly sensitive to the cytotoxic, pro-oxidant effects of high doses of ASC, with an average 50 % lethal concentration (LC50) of 3 mM, depending on cell type, ASC concentration, and time of exposure. Conversely, high doses of ASC neither did exert significant cytotoxic effects nor impaired the differentiation potential in cord blood (CB) CD34+ normal cells. Since plasma ASC concentrations within the millimolar (mM) range can be easily and safely reached by intravenous administration, we conclude that phase I/II clinical trials using high doses of ASC should be designed for patients with advanced/refractory AML and APL.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 11.,"BACKGROUND: Cellular engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) can be affected by pre-HPCT antibodies against donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA; donor-specific antibodies [DSAs]), which are commonly acquired by either pregnancy or transfusion. Issues regarding high assay sensitivity and variable interpretation limit routine screening for DSAs. Platelet (PLT) transfusion refractoriness (PTR) is relatively common in patients with hematologic malignancies, and anti-HLA alloantibodies can be identified in up to 20% of cases. For patients with PTR undergoing subsequent allogeneic HPCT, however, the effect if any on subsequent PLT nonengraftment is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 480 adults who underwent T-replete HPCT for hematologic malignancy and compared the posttransplantation clinical outcomes between patients who were PTR before HPCT and those who were not. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PTR was not directly associated with PLT nonengraftment or graft failure, but did predict for early intensive care unit admission, which was the only variable associated with these outcomes (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PTR before HPCT identifies patients at higher risk of early clinical rather than immunologic complications.",,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",,['(c) 2015 AABB.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multitude of genetic and exogenous causes are responsible for few other cases. Goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of GATA2 deficiency in children and adults with PAP and hematologic disorders. METHODS: Of 21 patients with GM-CSF-autoantibody negative PAP, 13 had no other organ involvement and 8 had some form of hematologic disorder. The latter were sequenced for GATA2. RESULTS: Age at start of PAP ranged from 0.3 to 64 years, 4 patients were children. In half of the subjects GATA2-sequence variations were found, two of which were considered disease causing. Those two patients had the typical phenotype of GATA2 deficiency, one of whom additionally showed a previously undescribed feature - a cholesterol pneumonia. Hematologic disorders included chronic myeloic leukemia, juvenile myelo-monocytic leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, sideroblastic anemia and two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A 4 year old child with MDS and DiGeorge Syndrome Type 2 was rescued with repetitive whole lung lavages and her PAP was cured with heterologous stem cell transplant. CONCLUSIONS: In children and adults with severe GM-CSF negative PAP a close cooperation between pneumologists and hemato-oncologists is needed to diagnose the underlying diseases, some of which are caused by mutations of transcription factor GATA2.

Epub 2015 Aug 11.,"BACKGROUND: Findings from clinical trials and population-based studies have differed with regard to whether mortality within 30 days of diagnosis (early death) of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has decreased in the era of all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Using data from the California Cancer Registry, the authors investigated 7-day and 30-day mortality and survival in 772 patients who were aged birth to 39 years when they were diagnosed with APL during 1988 to 2011. Logistic regression and Cox proportional models were used to examine the association of early death and survival, respectively, with sociodemographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality decreased significantly over time, from 26% (1988-1995) to 14% (2004-2011) (P =.004). On multivariable analysis, the odds of 30-day mortality were 3 times as high during 1988 through 1995 than 2004 through 2011 (P =.001). However, 7-day mortality did not improve over time (P =.229). When patients who died within 7 days of diagnosis were excluded, the 30-day mortality during 1996 to 2011 was 3% to 8%, which is similar to levels reported in clinical trials. Higher early death and lower survival were associated with a lack of health insurance (1996-2011) (early death odds ratio, 2.67; P =.031) and Hispanic race/ethnicity (early death odds ratio, 2.13; P =.014). Early death was not found to be associated with age, sex, socioeconomic status, or hospital type. Black patients also experienced worse survival. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study revealed a decreased 30-day mortality during the all-trans retinoic acid era, but 7-day mortality remained high. Efforts to achieve equal outcomes in young patients with APL should focus on improving access to effective treatment, mainly among uninsured patients and those of Hispanic and black race/ethnicity.","['U55/CCR921930-02/PHS HHS/United States', 'U58DP003862-01/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000140C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000035C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000035I/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000034C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP003862/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['(c) 2015 American Cancer Society.'],,,['NIHMS711955'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 8.,"Galectin 3 is a member of a family of beta-galactoside binding proteins and has emerged as an important regulator of diverse functions critical in cancer biology including apoptosis, metastasis, immune surveillance, molecular trafficking, mRNA splicing, gene expression, and inflammation. Galectin 3's ability to support cancer cell survival by intra-cellular and extra-cellular mechanisms suggests this molecule is an important component of the tumor microenvironment that potentially could be targeted for therapy. Data is emerging that Galectin 3 is elevated in many cancers including solid tumors and the cancers of the blood. Galectin 3 also appears to be a key molecule produced by tumor microenvironment support cells including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) to suppress immune surveillance by killing T cells and interfering with NK cell function and by supporting metastasis. Levels of Galectin 3 increase in the MSC of aging mice and perhaps this contributes to the development of cancer in the elderly. Galectin 3 modulates surface protein expression of a diverse set of glycoproteins including CD44 by regulating endocytosis of these proteins. In addition, Galectin 3 binding to receptor kinases such as CD45 and the T cell receptor is critical in the regulation of their function. In this review I will examine the various mechanisms how Galectin 3 supports chemoresistance and metastasis in solid tumors and in leukemia and lymphoma. I will also discuss possible therapeutic strategies to target this Galectin for cancer therapy.

The expression pattern and potential roles of Mcl(-1) in Parkinson's diseases (PD) are still unknown. In this study, our results indicated that 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) treatment augmented the expression of Mcl(-1) at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, we observed increased phosphorylation of Elk-1at Ser383 as well as nuclear translocation of Elk-1 in exposure to MPP+ treatment. Importantly, the elevated expression of Mcl(-1) induced by MPP+ was abolished by knockdown of Elk-1. It was also found that inhibition of Mcl(-1) by small RNA transfection exacerbates MPP + -induced LDH release after 48 h incubation. In addition, Hoechst 33,258 nuclear staining results demonstrated that silence of Mcl(-1) induced a significant increase in apoptosis in cells when compared with the control condition. Mechanistically, the levels of cleaved Caspase3 and PARP were elevated in MPP+ treated cells, which was exacerbated by knockdown of Mcl(-1). These findings suggest that Mcl(-1) might be a potential therapeutic target for PD treatment.",,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'R865A5OY8J (1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"AIM: Information about fusion transcripts in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is used to risk-stratify patients, decide on the treatment and to detect minimal residual disease. This study was conducted to determine the frequency of common fusion transcripts BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4 and E2A-PBX1 for B-ALL and SIL-TAL1 for T-ALL as seen at a tertiary care center in India. METHODS: Up to 304 new cases of ALL (271 B-ALL and 33 T-ALL) diagnosed on morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping were studied. All were screened for the common fusion transcripts by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Both our B- (218/271; 80.4%) and T-ALL (26/33; 78.8%) patients were largely children. In the B-ALL children, BCR-ABL was detected in 26/218 (11.9%), E2A-PBX1 in 13/218 (5.9%), TEL-AML1 in 16/218 (7.3%) and MLL-AF4 in 3/218 (1.4%) patients. Adult B-ALL cases had BCR-ABL in 15/53 (28.3%) and E2A-PBX in 2/53 (3.8%); however, no other fusion transcript was detected. SIL-TAL1 was found in four of 26 pediatric (15%) and zero of 7 adult T-ALL cases. CONCLUSION: The higher incidence of BCR-ABL and lower incidence of TEL-AML1 in our ALL patients, both in children and adults as compared with the West, suggests that patients in India may be biologically different. This difference may explain at least in part the higher relapse rate and poorer outcome in our B-ALL cases.",,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['(c) 2015 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"We have previously shown that overexpression of the human tumor suppressor protein P53 causes cell death of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. P53 overproduction led to transcriptional downregulation of some yeast genes, such as the TRX1/2 thioredoxin system, which plays a key role in cell protection against various oxidative stresses induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present work, the impact of TRX2 overexpression on apoptosis mediated by p53 overexpression in yeast is investigated. In yeast cells expressing P53 under an inducible promoter together with TRX2 under a strong constitutive promoter, we showed that Tr2p overproduction reduced the apoptotic effect exerted by P53 and increased the viability of the P53-overproducing cells. Furthermore, measurements of ROS amounts by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy indicated that the TRX2 protein acted probably through its increased detoxifying activity on the P53-generated ROS. The steady-state level and activity of P53 were not affected by TRX2 overexpression, as shown by western blotting and functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast (FASAY), respectively. The growth inhibitory effect of P53 was partially reversed by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Our data strengthen the idea that overexpression of a single gene (trx2) decreases the p53-mediated cell death by decreasing ROS accumulation.",,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (TRX2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since there is a latency period between initial benzene exposure and the development of leukemia, subsequent impact of benzene on HS/PCs are crucial for a deeper understanding of the carcinogenicity and hematotoxicity in post-exposure stage. This study aims to explore the effects of benzene on HS/PCs and gene-expression in Wnt, Notch and Hh signaling pathways in post-exposure stage. The C3H/He mice were injected subcutaneously with benzene (0, 150, 300 mg/kg/day) for three months and were monitored for another 10 months post-exposure. The body weights were monitored, the relative organ weights, blood parameters and bone marrow smears were examined. Frequency of lineage(-) sca-1(+) c-kit(+) (LSK) cells, capability of colony forming and expression of genes in Wnt, Notch and Hedghog (Hh) signaling pathways were also analyzed. The colony formation of the progenitor cells for BFU-E, CFU-GEMM and CFU-GM was significantly decreased with increasing benzene exposure relative to controls, while no significant difference was observed in colonies for CFU-G and CFU-M. The mRNA level of cyclin D1 was increased and Notch 1 and p53 were decreased in LSK cells in mice exposed to benzene but with no statistical significance. These results suggest that subsequent toxic effects of benzene on LSK cells and gene expression in Wnt, Notch and Hh signaling pathways persist in post-exposure stage and may play roles in benzene-induced hematotoxicity.",,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B43-PAP exhibited in vivo antileukemic activity in preclinical studies as well as on a single-agent phase I clinical trial. This pediatric phase I/II study evaluated the toxicity profile and efficacy of B43-PAP immunotoxin in combination with standard induction chemotherapy in children and adolescents with relapsed CD19-positive B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of B43-PAP were assessed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: B43-PAP in combination with standard 3 and 4-drug induction chemotherapy was administered on days 9-13 and 21-25 of a 28-day treatment course with vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, daunomycin, and intrathecal methotrexate. Thirty patients with relapsed B-ALL were enrolled on study CCG-0957. RESULTS: Grade III/IV nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicities were encountered in 4 patients evaluable for toxicity and included myalgias, motor dysfunction, pulmonary toxicity, and elevated liver transaminase. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred only with the 4-drug regimen. Fourteen patients achieved a complete remission at the end of induction among the 20 patients evaluable for response. CONCLUSIONS: B43-PAP in combination with standard induction chemotherapy can be safely administered and exhibits clinical antileukemic activity against relapsed B-ALL.","['CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (pokeweed antiviral protein)']",,,,,['NIHMS699316'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the critical role of bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) and p53 proteins in DNA damage -induced apoptosis, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of cAMP-elevating agents on these proteins in doxorubicin-treated pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) NALM-6 cells.The pre-B ALL cell line NALM-6 was cultured and treated with doxorubicin in combination with or without cAMP-elevating agents forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Cell viability was measured by trypan blue staining and MTT assay. For evaluation of apoptosis, annexin-V staining by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assay were used. Protein expression of p53, BAD and phoshorylated BAD was detected by western blotting analysis.cAMP-increasing agents diminished the doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity in NALM-6 cells as indicated by the viability assays. Annexin-V apoptosis assay showed that the cAMP-elevating agents decreased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, doxorubicin-induced caspase-3 activity was attenuated in the presence of cAMP-increasing agents. Western blot results revealed the reduced expression of p53 protein in cells treated with combination of cAMP-elevating agents and doxorubicin in contrast to cells treated with doxorubicin alone. Expression of total BAD protein was not affected by doxorubicin and cAMP-elevating agents. However, phosphorylation of BAD protein was induced in the presence of cAMP-elevating agents. Our study suggests that elevated cAMP levels inhibit doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in pre-B ALL cells through induction of BAD phosphorylation and abrogation of p53 accumulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of both acute and chronic GVHD on survival rate in patients with AML who received HSCT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a longitudinal study, 587 patients with AML who underwent bone marrow transplantation in Tehran-Iran between1991 and 2011 were recruited. All patient records were analyzed for the occurrence of adverse events including acute and chronic GVHD and leukemia relapse. Data were analyzed using Log-rank, Kaplan-Meier, Univariate and Multivariate Cox Regression models. RESULTS: The five-year overall survival (OS) was found to be 71.9% (95% CI: 67.40-76.41). Also there was a significant relationship between cGVHD and OS (P=0.001, HR = 0.476, 95%). Hazard of death in these patients was less than those who did not experience an occurrence of cGVHD and aGVHD (HR= 0.629, P= 0.078). A significant relationship between cGVHD and relapse was observed (P< 0.001) indicating that patients who developed cGVHD experienced a better survival rate. A significant relationship was also found between overall survival and aGVHD grade (P< 0.001). Hazard of death (HD) for cGVHD and relapse variables were estimated to be 0.554 and 3.869. DISCUSSION: This study is one of the largest studies (regarding the number of participants) done to date in the Middle East with quite a long duration (20 years). cGVHD appears to have a positive influence on survival rate in patients with AML who received HSCT. It is recommended that further studies investigate the underlying reason or mechanisms behind this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first case was a 78-year-old male who initially presented with CLL and then developed diffuse lymphadenopathy and ascites shortly after. Ascites cytology showed a population of large lymphoid cells positive for MYC (8q24) rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and overexpression of c-MYC by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The second case was a 66-year-old male presented with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes and pleural effusion after a long history of CLL. Biopsy showed large B-cells positive for c-MYC overexpression and high Ki-67 proliferation index (80-90%). The third case was a 62-year-old female with CLL who presented for lobectomy for lung adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, along with the carcinoma, large B-cell lymphoma was incidentally found which had the same immunophenotype as the CLL. FISH analysis revealed gain of c-MYC at 8q and IHC showed increased c-MYC expression.

A 60-year-old male patient presented with obvious leukocytosis and progressive weakness. Morphology of peripheral blood and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry pointed to a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using IGH-CCND1 probe was negative for CCND1 abnormality, but demonstrated IGH breakapart signals. The initial diagnosis of CLL was established and the patient was treated with six courses of immunochemotherpy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Complete remission (CR) was achieved at the end of treatment, but disease relapsed quickly. The patient was transferred to our hospital, flow cytometry using additional markers showed that the clonal cells were CD200+(dim), CD148+(strong), and chromosome analysis revealed a complex karyotype, 47, XY, t(12;14)(p13;q32), +12, del(9p21), which indicated over-expression of CCND2, and immunostaining showed strong positivity of SOX11 further confirming the characteristics of CCND1-negtive MCL.

METHODS: lung neuroendocrine tumors were analyzed for LRP16 gene expression by two-step non-biotin immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Fifty of ninety (55.6%) cases of neuroendocrine lung tumors tested were positive for LRP16 protein by immunohistochemistry. The expression of LRP16 was mainly located in cytoplasm and nucleus of tumor cells. LRP16 protein was corresponding to tumor type and clinical stage, as well as survival time.

The interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP; IL1R3) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell-mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody suppresses the proliferation of primary human AML cells. Hence, IL1RAP can be efficiently targeted with an anti-IL1RAP antibody capable of both achieving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and blocking of IL-1 signaling as modes of action. Collectively, these results provide important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML.","['R21 CA168369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA168369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK090971/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK090971/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (IL1RAP protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 10.,"Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) is an RNA-binding protein that plays important roles in splicing of mRNA precursors. SRSF2 mutations are frequently found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and certain leukemias, but how these mutations affect SRSF2 function has only begun to be examined. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease to introduce the P95H mutation to SRSF2 in K562 leukemia cells, generating an isogenic model so that splicing alterations can be attributed solely to mutant SRSF2. We found that SRSF2 (P95H) misregulates 548 splicing events (<1% of total). Of these events, 374 involved the inclusion of cassette exons, and the inclusion was either increased (206) or decreased (168). We detected a specific motif (UCCA/UG) enriched in the more-included exons and a distinct motif (UGGA/UG) in the more-excluded exons. RNA gel shift assays showed that a mutant SRSF2 derivative bound more tightly than its wild-type counterpart to RNA sites containing UCCAG but bound less tightly to UGGAG sites. Thus in most cases the pattern of exon inclusion or exclusion correlated with stronger or weaker RNA binding, respectively. We further show that the P95H mutation does not affect other functions of SRSF2, i.e., protein-protein interactions with key splicing factors. Our results thus demonstrate that the P95H mutation positively or negatively alters the binding affinity of SRSF2 for cognate RNA sites in target transcripts, leading to misregulation of exon inclusion. Our findings shed light on the mechanism of the disease-associated SRSF2 mutation in splicing regulation and also reveal a group of misspliced mRNA isoforms for potential therapeutic targeting.",['R01 GM048259/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (CRISPR-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,['GEO/GSE71299'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the effect of age on NMA haplo-BMT outcomes in patients age 50 to 75 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 271 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies, age 50 to 75 years, who received NMA, T-cell-replete haplo-BMT with high-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: The median age was 61 years, with 115 patients (42%) age 50 to 59, 129 (48%) age 60 to 69, and 27 (10%) age 70 to 75 years. Overall, 84% of patients had intermediate- or high-/very high-risk disease. The 6-month probabilities of grade 3 or 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 3% and 8%, respectively. Patients in their 50s, 60s, and 70s had 6-month NRM probabilities of 8%, 9%, and 7%, respectively (P=.20). With a median follow-up of 4 years, corresponding 3-year progression-free survival probabilities were 39%, 35%, and 33% (P=.65), and corresponding 3-year overall survival probabilities were 48%, 45%, and 44% (P=.66). Three-year progression-free survival probabilities were 40% in acute myeloid leukemia (n=65), 39% in aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=83), and 37% in indolent or mantle-cell lymphoma (n=65). Older patient age was associated with a significantly higher risk of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD but not grade 3 to 4 acute or chronic GVHD. No statistically significant associations were found between older age (relative to age 50 to 59 years or as a continuous variable) and NRM, relapse, or survival. CONCLUSION: NMA haplo-BMT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide has encouraging safety and survival outcomes in patients age 50 to 75 years. In patients otherwise fit for BMT, the results support consideration of this approach despite advanced age.","['T32 GM007309/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001079/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA015396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007525/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 CA198315/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA174951/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 7.,"Skin cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Mounting evidence shows that exposure of the skin to solar UV radiation results in inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways and immunosuppression thereby resulting in skin cancer. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is well known to function as an anti-apoptotic factor, especially in numerous malignancies, but the relationship between STAT3 activation and DNA damage response in skin cancer is still not fully understood. We now report that STAT3 inhibited DNA damage induced by UV and STAT3 mediated upregulation of GADD45gamma and MDC-1 and the phosphorylation of H2AX in UV induced DNA damage. Notably, STAT3 can increase the expression of ATR in A431 cells. Luciferase assay shows that STAT3 activates the transcription of ATR promoter. More importantly, microRNA-383 suppressed ATR expression by targeting 3' (untranslated regions)UTR of ATR in A431 cells, and STAT3 down-regulates the transcription of miR-383 promoter. Thus, these results reveal the new insight that ATR is down-regulated by STAT3-regulated microRNA-383 in A431 cells. Moreover, overexpression of STAT3 enhanced expression of antiapoptosis genes BCL-1 and MCL-1, and depletion of STAT3 sensitized A431 cells to apoptotic cell death following UV. Collectively, these studies suggest that STAT3 may be a potential target for both the prevention and treatment of human skin cancer.",,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MDC1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN383 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The results of a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that TNF-alpha reduced histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) recruitment but increased p300 (a histone acetyltransferase) recruitment to MMP-9 promoter regions surrounding NFkappaB and AP-1 binding sites. Consistently, TNF-alpha increased enrichment of the acetylated histone H3 mark on MMP-9 promoter regions. DNA affinity purification assay revealed that p300 and HDAC1 could bind oligonucleotides containing AP-1/c-Jun and NFkappaB/p65 binding sites. Chromosome conformation capture assay showed that TNF-alpha stimulated chromosomal loops in the MMP-9 promoter via NFkappaB/p65 and AP-1/c-Jun. The p300-associated acetyltransferase activity was crucial for p65/c-Jun-mediated DNA looping, and inhibition of HDAC activity increased the level of DNA looping. Reduction in the level of DNA looping eliminated all TNF-alpha-stimulated MMP-9 up-regulation. Taken together, our data suggest that p65/c-Jun-mediated DNA looping is involved in TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 up-regulation and that the recruitment of p300 or HDAC1 to NFkappaB and AP-1 binding sites modifies the level of DNA looping.",,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Bcl-2 executes its anti-apoptotic function at two different sites in the cell. At the mitochondria, Bcl-2 via its hydrophobic cleft interacts with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members to inhibit apoptosis. At the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Bcl-2 via its Bcl-2 homology (BH)4 domain, prevents excessive Ca(2+) signals by interacting with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), an intracellular Ca(2+)-release channel. A peptide tool (BIRD-2) that targets the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 reverses Bcl-2's inhibitory action on IP3Rs and can trigger pro-apoptotic Ca(2+)signals in B-cell cancer cells. Here, we explored whether HA14-1, a Bcl-2 inhibitor that also inhibits sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCA), could potentiate BIRD-2-induced cell death. We measured apoptosis in Annexin V/7-AAD stained cells using flow cytometry and intracellular Ca(2+) signals in Fura2-AM-loaded cells using an automated fluorescent plate reader. HA14-1 potentiated BIRD-2-induced Ca(2+) release from the ER and apoptosis in both BIRD-2-sensitive DLBCL cell lines (SU-DHL-4) and in primary B-CLL cells. BIRD-2-resistant DLBCL cells (OCI-LY-1) were already very sensitive to HA14-1. Yet, although BIRD-2 moderately increased Ca(2+) levels in HA14-1-treated cells, apoptosis was not potentiated by BIRD-2 in these cells. These results further underpin the relevance of IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) signaling as a therapeutic target in the treatment of Bcl-2-dependent B-cell malignancies and the advantage of combination regimens with HA14-1 to enhance BIRD-2-induced cell death.",,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a phase II study of busulfan (.8 mg/kg i.v. twice daily on days -5, -4, -3, and -2) with clofarabine (40 mg/m(2) i.v. daily on days -5, -4, -3, and -2) conditioning before allogeneic 8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated HSCT. The primary endpoint was donor neutrophil engraftment by day +40. Secondary endpoints included nonrelapse mortality (NRM), acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Thirty-four patients (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], n = 25; myelodysplastic syndromes, n = 5; and acute lymphoid leukemia, n = 4) were enrolled. Day 40+ engraftment with donor chimerism was achieved in 33 of 34 patients with 1 patient dying before count recovery. Day 100 and 1-year NRM were 5.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 17.4) and 24% (95% CI, 11 to 39), respectively. The 2-year relapse rate was 26% (95% CI, 13 to 42). Cumulative incidences of acute and chronic GVHD were 21% and 44%, respectively. The 2-year PFS was 50% (95% CI, 32 to 65) and OS was 56% (95% CI, 38 to 71). For patients with AML in first complete remission, 2-year PFS and OS were both 82% (95% CI, 55 to 94).

Epub 2015 Aug 27.,"Over-expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w is frequently associated with cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Navitoclax (ABT-263), an orally bio-available small-molecule mimetic of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3, specifically inhibits Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. Despite promising results obtained from the clinical trials, the use of Navitoclax in patients is dose-limited due to induction of death of platelets via inhibition of Bcl-xL and subsequent thrombocytopenia. This side effect limits the use of Navitoclax in low doses and to very sensitive tumors. In this study, we show that HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells, which over-express Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, show a 10- to 20-fold higher sensitivity (EC50 = approximately 25-50 nM) to Navitoclax compared to non-HTLV-1-associated leukemic cells (EC50 = approximately 1 muM). Investigation of the molecular mechanisms revealed that the HTLV-1 oncogenic protein Tax up-regulates expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax which enhances the therapeutic efficacy of Navitoclax. In addition, we show that agents that inhibit the transcription elongation or translation initiation such as Wogonin and Roc-A can further decrease the effective dose of Navitoclax. Our study suggests that HTLV-1 ATL may be a good candidate disease for low dose Navitoclax therapy and probably with less risk of thrombocytopenia.",,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",,['(c) 2015 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western blot analysis indicated that BCL2L12 was aberrantly expressed in patient-isolated AML cells and AML cell lines. Furthermore, CD82 blockade by a specific antibody downregulated BCL2L12 in parallel with dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and AKT, whereas pharmacological inhibition of STAT5 and AKT activation decreased BCL2L12 expression in leukemia cells. In addition, shRNA-mediated downregulation of BCL2L12 increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and suppressed proliferation of leukemia cells, impairing their engraftment in immunodeficient mice.

To achieve this goal the concept of hybridization was established during the last decade. We employed this concept by coupling two artemisinin-derived precursors to obtain dimers or trimers with increased in vitro activity against Plasmodiumfalciparum 3D7 strain, leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM and multidrug-resistant subline CEM/ADR5000) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Dimer 4 (IC50 of 2.6 nM) possess superior antimalarial activity compared with its parent compound artesunic acid(3) (IC50 of 9.0 nM). Dimer5 and trimers6 and 7 display superior potency against both leukemia cell lines (IC50 up to 0.002 muM for CCRF-CEM and IC50 up to 0.20 muM for CEM/ADR5000) and are even more active than clinically used doxorubicin (IC50 1.61 muM for CEM/ADR5000). With respect to anti-HCMV activity, trimer6 is the most efficient hybrid (IC50 0.04 muM) outperforming ganciclovir (IC50 2.6 muM), dihydroartemisinin(IC50 >10 muM) and artesunic acid (IC50 3.8 muM).",,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '9RMU91N5K2 (artemisinin)']",,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we retrospectively collected data on the off-label use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, either alone or in association with hypomethylating agents and adoptive immunotherapy, in 13 patients with post-transplantation FLT3-ITD-positive AML relapses. Hematological response was documented in 12 of 13 patients (92%), and five of 13 (38%) achieved complete bone marrow remission. Treatment was overall manageable in the outpatient setting, although all patients experienced significant adverse events, especially severe cytopenias (requiring a donor stem cell boost in five patients) and typical hand-foot syndrome. None of the patients developed graft-vs.-host disease following sorafenib alone, whereas this was frequently observed when this was given in association with donor T-cell infusions. Six patients are alive and in remission at the last follow-up, and four could be bridged to a second allogeneic HSCT, configuring a 65 +/- 14% overall survival at 100 d from relapse. Taken together, our data suggest that sorafenib might represent a valid treatment option for patients with FLT3-ITD-positive post-transplantation relapses, manageable also in combination with other therapeutic strategies.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A cocktail of cytokines was used to differentiate KG1 to dendritic like cells (termed dKG1) and the effects of nine chemicals (respiratory and contact sensitisers) and an irritant control on surface marker expression, 'antigen presenting' function and cytokine expression investigated. The stability of these chemicals when dissolved was characterised using MALDI ToF MS. A Hill plot model was used with the cellular viability data to quantify the lethal dose 50% (LD50) and a maximum sub toxic concentration of each chemical defined. Cytokine expression by the treated dKG1 was quantified using multiplex immunobead analysis. Whilst dKG1 cells were morphologically similar to DCs, expression of specific surface markers was not typical for DCs derived from healthy precursor cells. When the chemicals were applied at defined sub toxic doses no effects on dKG1 phenotype, function, or cytokine expression, attributable to the sensitisation properties were discriminated. However, dKG1 cells were much more sensitive to the toxic effects of these chemicals compared to the parent KG1 cells. Only 4 of the 9 chemicals tested were stable when dissolved indicating that the effect of sensitising chemicals on antigen presenting cells may be related to species other than the parent compound.",,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Irritants)']",,['Crown Copyright (c) 2015.

Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and a normal karyotype were reported as the second and third most common karyotypes, respectively. We investigated cytogenetic karyotypes of six t-B-ALL cases with a pre-B cell immunophenotype. Ph + t-B-ALL was noted in four of six patients previously treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy. In addition, one case demonstrated MLL rearrangement at 11q23 locus while one case demonstrated normal cytogenetic karyotype. Five of the six t-B-ALL patients had persistent leukemia following initiation of chemotherapy for secondary leukemia with survival ranging from 10 to 21 months. To our knowledge, only fourteen patients with Ph + t-B-ALL have been described in the literature. In the current study, three of four cases with Ph + t-B-ALL were associated with treated breast carcinoma while one patient was treated for Hodgkin lymphoma. All four patients had undergone radiation therapy. The results may indicate a plausible association between Ph+t-B-ALL and prior radiation exposure.",,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,['(c) 2015 Japanese Society of Pathology and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 11.,"Disruptive technologies, such as communicative reprogramming (anakoinosis) with cellular therapies in situ for treating refractory metastatic cancer allow patient care to accelerate along a totally new trajectory and highlight what may well become the next sea change in the care of patients with many types of advanced neoplasia. Cellular therapy in situ consisted of repurposed drugs, pioglitazone plus all-trans retinoic acid or dexamethasone or interferon-alpha (dual transcriptional modulation) combined with metronomic low-dose chemotherapy or low-dose 5-azacytidine, plus/minus classic targeted therapy. The novel therapeutic tools for specifically designing communication processes within tumor diseases focus on redirecting (1) rationalizations of cancer hallmarks (constitution of single cancer hallmarks), (2) modular events, (3) the 'metabolism' of evolutionary processes (the sum of therapeutically and intrinsically inducible evolutionary processes) and (4) the holistic communicative context, which determines validity and denotation of tumor promoting communication lines. Published data on cellular therapies in situ (6 histologic tumor types, 144 patients, age 0.9-83 years) in castration-resistant prostate cancer, pretreated renal clear cell carcinoma, chemorefractory acute myelocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma > second-line, chemorefractory Hodgkin lymphoma or multivisceral Langerhans cell histiocytosis, outline the possibility for treating refractory metastatic cancer with the hope that this type of reprogrammed communication will be scalable with minimal toxicity. Accessibility to anakoinosis is a tumor inherent feature, and cellular therapy in situ addresses extrinsic and intrinsic drug resistance, by redirecting convergent organized communication tools, while been supported by quite different pattern of (molecular-)genetic aberrations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 11.,"PURPOSE: Many studies have investigated the possible association between birth order and risk of childhood cancer, although the evidence to date has been inconsistent. Birth order has been used as a marker for various in utero or childhood exposures and is relatively straightforward to assess. METHODS: Data were obtained on all children born in Denmark between 1973 and 2010, involving almost 2.5 million births and about 5,700 newly diagnosed childhood cancers before the age of 20 years. Data were analyzed using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: We failed to observe associations between birth order and risk of any childhood cancer subtype, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia; all rate ratios were close to one. Further analyses stratified by birth cohort (those born between 1973 and 1990, and those born between 1991 and 2010) also failed to show any associations. Considering stillbirths and/or controlling for birth weight and parental age in the analyses had no effect on the results. Analyses by years of birth (those born between 1973 and 1990, and those born between 1991 and 2010) did not show any changes in the overall pattern of no association. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of all children born in Denmark over an almost 40-year period, we did not observe an association between birth order and the risk of childhood cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 12.,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a treatment option for patients with poor risk CLL. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all CLL patients allografted at our institution, the University Hospital of Cologne, Germany. Data was collected on 40 patients from 2004 to 2012. The mean age was 54, and the majority were male (75 %). On average, the patients were diagnosed 6 years (range 2-12) prior to transplant with an average of 4 years (range 1-8) from time of first-line therapy to transplant. The remission states at the time of transplant were complete remission (CR) (n = 4), stable disease (n = 10), partial remission (n = 20) and progressive disease (n = 6). Only reduced intensity conditioning regimens were employed. The average CD34(+) cell dose was 4.16 x 10(6)/kg. Neutrophil engraftment was seen by day +17 (range 10-23) post-transplant, and 88 % achieved 95-100 % donor chimerism by day 100. Overall survival, progression-free survival and non-relapse mortality at 2 years post-transplant were 65, 52.5 and 27.5 %, respectively. A total of 51 % of patients were found to be minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative at 1 year post-transplant. Our single-centre experience confirms the valuable role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in the treatment of poor risk CLL patients with promising long-term survival and acceptable transplant-related mortality. The advent of newer therapeutic agents should not hinder the consideration of allo-SCT for this patient cohort as it remains the only curative option for these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients that develop bone marrow aplasia become immunocompromised, thus becoming liable to bacterial and fungal infections. Fungal infections caused by Candida are frequent. Hepatosplenic candidiasis (HSC) is a frequent consequence of invasive candidiasis which is clinically presented with prolonged febrility unresponsive to antibiotics. CASE OUTLINE: A 53-year-old patient with acute myeloid leukemia was submitted to standard chemotherapy ""3+7"" regimen (daunoblastine 80 mg i.v. on days 1 to 3, cytarabine 2 x 170 mg i.v. during 7 days) and achieved complete remission. However, during remission he developed febrility unresponsive to antibiotics. Computerised tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed multiple hypodense lesions within the liver and spleen. Haemocultures on fungi were negative. However, seroconversion of biomarkers for invasive fungal infection (FI) (Candida and Aspergillus antigen/Ag and antibody/Ab) indicated possible HSC. Only high positivity of anti-Candida IgG antibodies, positivity of mannan and CT finding we regarded sufficient for the diagnosis and antimycotic therapy.Three months of treatment with different antimycotics were necessary for complete disappearance of both clinical symptoms and CT findings. CONCLUSION: In patients with prolonged febrile neutropenia IFI has to be strongly suspected. If imaging techniques show multiple hypodense lesions within liver and spleen, HSC has to be taken seriously into consideration. We believe that, along with CT finding, positive laboratory Candida biomarkers (mannan and IgG antibodies) should be considered sufficient for""probable HSC"" and commencement of antifungal therapy, which must be long enough, i.e. until complete disappearance of clinical symptoms and CT findings are achieved.",,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', 'Systemic candidiasis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
