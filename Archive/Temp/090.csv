Recently, gene expression signatures (GES) from functionally defined AML LSC populations were reported, and expression of a 'core enriched' (CE) GES, representing 44 genes activated in LCSs, conferred shorter survival in cytogenetically normal (CN) AML. The prognostic impact of the CE GES in the context of other molecular markers, including gene mutations and microRNA (miR) expression alterations, is unknown and its clinical utility is unclear. We studied associations of the CE GES with known molecular prognosticators, miR expression profiles, and outcomes in 364 well-characterized CN-AML patients. A high CE score (CE(high)) associated with FLT3-internal tandem duplication, WT1 and RUNX1 mutations, wild-type CEBPA and TET2, and high ERG, BAALC and miR-155 expression. CE(high) patients had a lower complete remission (CR) rate (P=0.003) and shorter disease-free (DFS, P<0.001) and overall survival (OS, P<0.001) than CE(low) patients. These associations persisted in multivariable analyses adjusting for other prognosticators (CR, P=0.02; DFS, P<0.001; and OS, P<0.001). CE(high) status was accompanied by a characteristic miR expression signature. Fifteen miRs were upregulated in both younger and older CE(high) patients, including miRs relevant for stem cell function. Our results support the clinical relevance of LSCs and improve risk stratification in AML.","['Metzeler, K H', 'Maharry, K', 'Kohlschmidt, J', 'Volinia, S', 'Mrozek, K', 'Becker, H', 'Nicolet, D', 'Whitman, S P', 'Mendler, J H', 'Schwind, S', 'Eisfeld, A-K', 'Wu, Y-Z', 'Powell, B L', 'Carter, T H', 'Wetzler, M', 'Kolitz, J E', 'Baer, M R', 'Carroll, A J', 'Stone, R M', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Marcucci, G', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Metzeler KH', 'Maharry K', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Volinia S', 'Mrozek K', 'Becker H', 'Nicolet D', 'Whitman SP', 'Mendler JH', 'Schwind S', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Wu YZ', 'Powell BL', 'Carter TH', 'Wetzler M', 'Kolitz JE', 'Baer MR', 'Carroll AJ', 'Stone RM', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['U10 CA026806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA129657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130614,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Rate', '*Transcriptome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3890747,['NIHMS524475'],2013/06/15 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013181 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.181 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):2023-31. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.181.

However, the existence of cancer cells with apoptotic defects is one of the major obstacles in gene-virotherapy. Here, we investigated whether a strategy that combines the oncolytic effects of an adenoviral vector with simultaneous expression of Beclin-1, an autophagy gene, offers a therapeutic advantage for leukemia. A Beclin-1 cDNA was cloned in an oncolytic adenovirus with chimeric Ad5/11 fiber (SG511-BECN). SG511-BECN treatment induced significant autophagic cell death, and resulted in enhanced cell killing in a variety of leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic blasts. SG511-BECN effects were seen in chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia with resistance to imatinib or chemotherapy, but exhibited much less cytotoxicity on normal cells. The SG511-BECN-induced autophagic cell death could be partially reversed by RNA interference knockdown of UVRAG, ATG5, and ATG7. We also showed that SG511-BECN strongly inhibited the growth of leukemic progenitors in vitro. In murine leukemia models, SG511-BECN prolonged the survival and decreased the xenograft tumor size by inducing autophagic cell death. Our results suggest that infection of leukemia cells with an oncolytic adenovirus overexpressing Beclin-1 can induce significant autophagic cell death and provide a new strategy for the elimination of leukemic cells via a unique mechanism of action distinct from apoptosis.","['Tong, Yin', 'You, Liangshun', 'Liu, Hui', 'Li, Lu', 'Meng, Haitao', 'Qian, Qijun', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Tong Y', 'You L', 'Liu H', 'Li L', 'Meng H', 'Qian Q', 'Qian W']","['Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, P.R.

In this study, the relationship between ASNS expression and clinical outcomes after surgical resection was investigated, and the therapeutic value of ASNS was also evaluated. METHODS: The expression of ASNS was evaluated in HCC samples by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry assays. The correlation between ASNS expression and clinicopathological features was investigated. Potential clinicopathological prognostic factors were examined by univariate and multivariate survival analysis. Asparagine synthetase was overexpressed and knocked down in HCC cell lines to assess the influence of the enzyme on cell proliferation, migration and tumourigenicity. L-asparaginase was used to treat HCC cells with high or low levels of ASNS in vitro and in vivo to examine the therapeutic efficacy. RESULTS: The expression of ASNS was higher in HCC tumour tissues and was closely correlated with the serum AFP level, tumour size, microscopic vascular invasion, tumour encapsulation, TNM stage and BCLC stage. Patients with low ASNS expression levels had a poor prognosis with respect to overall survival (OS). The multivariate survival analysis indicated that ASNS is an independent prognostic factor for OS. Furthermore, functional studies demonstrated that ASNS significantly inhibits the proliferation, migration and tumourigenicity of HCC cells. The knockdown of ASNS markedly increased sensitivity to L-asparaginase, indicating that cells with different ASNS protein levels have different sensitivities to L-asparaginase. CONCLUSION: The expression of ASNS is an independent factor affecting the survival of HCC patients, and low ASNS expression in HCC was correlated with worse surgical outcomes. The ASNS may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.","['Zhang, B', 'Dong, L-W', 'Tan, Y-X', 'Zhang, J', 'Pan, Y-F', 'Yang, C', 'Li, M-H', 'Ding, Z-W', 'Liu, L-J', 'Jiang, T-Y', 'Yang, J-H', 'Wang, H-Y']","['Zhang B', 'Dong LW', 'Tan YX', 'Zhang J', 'Pan YF', 'Yang C', 'Li MH', 'Ding ZW', 'Liu LJ', 'Jiang TY', 'Yang JH', 'Wang HY']","[""International Cooperation Laboratory on Signal Transduction, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Institute, Second Military Medical University, 225 Changhai Road, Shanghai 200438, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130613,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Asparaginase/pharmacology', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', '*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/enzymology/mortality/surgery', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Liver Neoplasms/enzymology/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Survival', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/analysis']",PMC3708586,,2013/06/15 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2013/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013293 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.293 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 Jul 9;109(1):14-23. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.293.

Tumoral lesions include benign (meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, schwannomas) and malignant neoplasms (chondrosarcomas, chordomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, leukemia, metastases). Inflammatory/infectious conditions comprise: Tolosa Hunt, abscess, Lemierre syndrome and thrombophlebitis. Vascular lesions include: hemangiomas, carotido-cavernous fistula, aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations. Congenital conditions include the epidermoid cyst, dermoid cyst and fatty deposits.

Annamycin is a highly lipophilic form of the anthracycline doxorubicin with the ability to bypass multidrug resistance mechanisms of cellular drug resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a phase I/II multicenter, open-label, study to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of nanomolecular liposomal annamycin in adult patients with refractory ALL. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled; the MTD was determined to be 150 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days. Other than tumor lysis syndrome, there were 3 grade 3 mucositis which comprised the MTD determination. There was also 1 case each of grade 3 diarrhea, typhlitis, and nausea. After determining the MTD, a 10-patient phase IIA trial was conducted. Eight of the patients completed 1 cycle of the 3 days of treatment at the MTD. Of these, 5 (62%) had an efficacy signal with complete clearing of circulating peripheral blasts. Three of these subjects also cleared bone marrow blasts with 1 subsequently proceeding onto successful stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: Single-agent nanomolecular liposomal annamycin appears to be well tolerated, and shows evidence of clinical activity as a single agent in refractory adult ALL.","['Wetzler, Meir', 'Thomas, Debora A', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Shepard, Robert', 'Ford, Laurie A', 'Heffner, Thompson L', 'Parekh, Samir', 'Andreeff, Michael', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Wetzler M', 'Thomas DA', 'Wang ES', 'Shepard R', 'Ford LA', 'Heffner TL', 'Parekh S', 'Andreeff M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian HM']","['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA. meir.wetzler@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130610,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'SNU299M83Q (annamycin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nanoparticles/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",PMC3737573,['NIHMS494299'],2013/06/15 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(13)00115-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2013.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Aug;13(4):430-4. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2013.03.015.

The attribution of serious AEs in this phase to disease progression vs. drug toxicity is tenuous. We aimed to determine the incidence of serious AEs in the last 2 weeks of life of patients with refractory-relapsed AML undergoing salvage therapy (ST). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults who received ST from September 2010 to December 2011 were evaluated. Data collected included incidence of serious AEs, type of ST, medical complications, length of hospital stay, and Intensive Care Unit stays, organ dysfunctions, and use of life support therapies. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients received ST. Most 64 patients (52%) received intensive chemotherapy; 39 patients (32%) had single investigational drug therapies, and 19 patients (16%) received therapy with hypomethylating agents. Common complications were pneumonia (82%), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy 72 patients (59%), and septic shock 60 patients (49%). Notable complications included: acute respiratory failure justifying invasive mechanical ventilation in 60 patients (42%), renal failure requiring dialysis in 33 patients (27%), atrial fibrillation in 37 patients (30%), and prolonged prothrombin time (grade 3) in 68 patients (56%). There was no difference in the incidence of these complications by type of ST. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline expectations of serious AEs at the end of life of patients with AML undergoing ST were established. The AE profiles of new investigational interventions or therapies could be compared with what would be expected in such circumstances from the combined effect of disease progression, expected complications of the AML therapy, and therapies delivered in previous historical contexts.","['Cardenas-Turanzas, Marylou', 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Cortes JE', 'Jabbour E', 'Faderl S', 'Pierce SA', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This Phase I dose-escalation study evaluated the safety and tolerability of barasertib, combined with LDAC, in patients aged 60 years or older with de novo or secondary AML. Barasertib (7-day continuous intravenous infusion) plus LDAC 20 mg (subcutaneous injection twice daily for 10 days) was administered in 28-day cycles. The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which </= 1 patient within a cohort of 6 experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (clinically significant adverse event [AE] or laboratory abnormality considered related to barasertib). The MTD cohort was expanded to 12 patients. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (median age, 71 years) received >/= 1 treatment cycle (n = 6, 800 mg; n = 13, 1000 mg; n = 3, 1200 mg). DLTs were reported in 2 patients (both, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 stomatitis/mucositis; 1200 mg cohort). The most common AEs were infection (73%), febrile neutropenia (59%), nausea (50%), and diarrhea (46%). Barasertib plus LDAC resulted in an overall response rate (International Working Group criteria) of 45% (n = 10/22; according to investigator opinion). CONCLUSION: The MTD of 1000 mg barasertib in combination with LDAC in older patients with AML was associated with acceptable tolerability and preliminary anti-AML activity.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Ribrag, Vincent', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Owen, Kate', 'Stockman, Paul K', 'Oliver, Stuart D']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Sekeres MA', 'Ribrag V', 'Rousselot P', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Owen K', 'Stockman PK', 'Oliver SD']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 557 patients, 65 years of age or older with newly diagnosed AML, treated at our institution between 2000 and 2010 with cytotoxic chemotherapy. NPM1 and FLT3 analysis were available in 146 patients (26%) and 388 patients (70%), respectively. RESULTS: NPM1 and FLT3 MUTs occurred in 16% and 12% of patients, respectively. No difference in median overall survival was observed between FLT3-MUT and NPM1-MUT patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy. Outcome was significantly better among patients with NPM1-MUT/FLT3-wild type (WT) genotype (n = 14) compared with patients carrying FLT3/NPM1 genotypes other than NPM1-MUT/FLT3-WT (n = 125). The complete remission rates were 71% and 49%, respectively (P = .11). The median survival was 21.5 months vs. 9.0 months and estimated 2-year survival rates were 51% vs. 38%, respectively (P = .003). NPM1 and FLT3 MUTs appear to occur less frequently in elderly AML patients. The prognostic effect of isolated NPM1- or isolated FLT3-MUT is minimal.

Development of therapeutic agents that can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells can help solve the problem. Emodin is an active anthraquinone that has been reported to have diverse biological effects. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the anticancer effects of emodin on growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and the expression of apoptosis-related genes in MCF-7 cells were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Growth inhibition induced by emodin was investigated by the MTS assay and the colony formation assay; while emodin-induced apoptosis was determined by the COMET assay and DNA fragmentation detection. Emodin (35 muM)-induced alterations in the expression of apoptotic-related genes were detected by using real-time PCR. RESULTS: Emodin had significant growth inhibitory effects on MCF-7 cells with IC(5)(0) = 7.22 microg/ml ( approximately 30 muM). It also exerted a concentration-dependant inhibitory effect on the colony-forming ability of MCF-7 cells with IC(5)(0) = 7.60 microg/ml ( approximately 30 microM). Hallmarks of apoptosis, such as single-strand DNA breakage and DNA fragmentation, were observed in emodin-treated MCF-7 cells. The gene expression of Fas ligand (FASL) was up-regulated (p < 0.01) but those of MCL1, CCND1 and C-MYC were down-regulated (p < 0.05) in emodin-treated MCF-7 cells. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study indicated that emodin could induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells through the modulation of the expression of apoptosis-related genes. The growth inhibitory effects of emodin might involve both the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptotic pathways and cell cycle arrest.","['Li, Wing-Yan', 'Chan, Robbie Yat-Kan', 'Yu, Peter Hoi-Fu', 'Chan, Shun-Wan']","['Li WY', 'Chan RY', 'Yu PH', 'Chan SW']","['Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130613,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Cathartics)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Cathartics/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Emodin/*pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/06/15 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2013.782322 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2013 Sep;51(9):1175-81. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2013.782322.

23762927,,Publisher,,,,,,2010,ML311: A Small Molecule that Potently and Selectively Disrupts the Protein-Protein Interaction of Mcl-1 and Bim: A Probe for Studying Lymphoid Tumorigenesis,,,"Although the induction of apoptosis can be an effective strategy for anti-cancer chemotherapy, emergence of drug resistance to existing pro-apoptotic drugs is a serious concern. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in acquiring drug resistance is of great interest for driving the discovery of new agents designed to thwart the escape routes tumor cells use to circumvent current therapy. The oncoproteins of the Bcl-2 family are activated in many forms of cancer, including the well-characterized lymphoid tumors multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL). Bcl-2 family members regulate apoptosis induced by many cytotoxic compounds through multiple protein-protein interactions. The pro-survival protein Mcl-1 interacts with Bcl-2 family oncoproteins, including Bim, to oppose cell death. Mcl-1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and is regulated by growth factors. Blocking the effects of Mcl-1, particularly through the inhibition of its interactions with pro-apoptotic oncogenes of the Bcl-2 family, is a promising approach for dramatically slowing tumor initiation, progression, and apoptosis resistance, especially in MM, where Mcl-1 is essential for tumor survival. We have used ultra-high throughput screening (uHTS) coupled with hit optimization strategy to discover potent and selective inhibitors of the Mcl-1/Bim interaction, including a designated probe compound, ML311. This new small molecule (also known as EU-5346) will be a useful tool for studying lymphoid tumorigenesis and to demonstrate the potential for using this strategy in therapies intended to bypass apoptosis resistance pathways that are activated in drug-resistant tumors.","['Bannister, Thomas', 'Koenig, Marcel', 'He, Yuanjun', 'Mishra, Jitendra', 'Spicer, Tim', 'Minond, Dmitriy', 'Saldanha, Adrian', 'Mercer, Becky A.', 'Cameron, Michael', 'Lena, Ryan', 'Carlson, Nicole', 'Richard, David', 'Cardone, Michael', 'Hodder, Peter']","['Bannister T', 'Koenig M', 'He Y', 'Mishra J', 'Spicer T', 'Minond D', 'Saldanha A', 'Mercer BA', 'Cameron M', 'Lena R', 'Carlson N', 'Richard D', 'Cardone M', 'Hodder P']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/06/14 06:00,,,['NBK143557 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,20130614,['20130314'],['20120416'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Probe Reports from the NIH Molecular Libraries Program'],['2013/06/14 06:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of short, noncoding RNAs, regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or cleavage. miRNAs are involved in many aspects of cell biology linked with formation of several cancer phenotypes. However, the relation between miRNAs and pathologic implication in ATLL is not well elucidated. Here, we evaluated the roles of cellular miRNAs in ATLL caused by HTLV-1. We found that the expression of miR-155 was increased in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. miR-155 expression was enhanced by Tax and binding of transcription factors, NF- kappa B and AP-1, on the transcription binding sites of miR-155 gene promoter region is important to increase the expression of miR-155 by Tax. Transfection of anti-miR-155 inhibitor, which inhibits the function of miR-155, inhibited the growth of HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. On the other hand, the growth of HTLV-1-negative T-cell lines was not changed by transfection of anti-miR-155. Forced expression of miR-155 enhanced the growth of HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. These findings indicate that targeting the functions of miRNAs is a novel approach to the prevention or treatment of ATLL.","['Tomita, Mariko']",['Tomita M'],"['Department of Pathology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Science, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120918,Egypt,ISRN Microbiol,ISRN microbiology,101605570,,,,PMC3671690,,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5402/2012/978607 [doi]'],epublish,ISRN Microbiol. 2012 Sep 18;2012:978607. doi: 10.5402/2012/978607.

The goal of the current study was to examine the gene expression and enzyme activity of the microsomal enzyme, 11- beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2, HSD2), which is responsible for the oxidation of bioactive glucocorticoids to their inert metabolites. Using the glucocorticoid-sensitive human leukemic cell line, CEM-C7, we were able to detect the expression of HSD2 at the level of mRNA (via RT-PCR), protein (via immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting), and enzyme activity (via conversion of tritiated cortisol to cortisone). Furthermore, we observed that HSD2 enzyme activity is down regulated in CEM-C7 cells that were pretreated with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (100 nM, <15 hours), and that this down regulation of enzyme activity is blocked by the administration of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU-486. Taken collectively, these data raise the possibility that the effectiveness of glucocorticoids in the treatment of human leukemias may be influenced by: (1) the ability of these neoplastic cells to metabolize glucocorticoids via HSD2 and (2) the ability of these steroids to regulate the expression of this key enzyme.","['Garbrecht, Mark R', 'Schmidt, Thomas J']","['Garbrecht MR', 'Schmidt TJ']","['Department of Biology, Winona State University, 234 Pasteur Hall, P.O.

There is a need for better prognostic markers and aberrant DNA methylation is a candidate in other malignancies, but its potential prognostic significance in T-ALL is hitherto undecided. DESIGN AND METHODS: Genome wide promoter DNA methylation analysis was performed in pediatric T-ALL samples (n = 43) using arrays covering >27000 CpG sites. Clinical outcome was evaluated in relation to methylation status and compared with a contemporary T-ALL group not tested for methylation (n = 32). RESULTS: Based on CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), T-ALL samples were subgrouped as CIMP+ (high methylation) and CIMP- (low methylation). CIMP- T-ALL patients had significantly worse overall and event free survival (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001, respectively) compared to CIMP+ cases.

(MA) is a natural source of many compounds with different biological effects. It has been described to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate cytotoxicity of three flavonoids isolated from MA (kuwanon E, cudraflavone B, and 4'-O-methylkuwanon E) and to determine their effects on proliferation of THP-1 cells, and on cell cycle progression of cancer cells. Anti-inflammatory effects were also determined for all three given flavonoids. Methods used in the study included quantification of cells by hemocytometer and WST-1 assays, flow cytometry, western blotting, ELISA, and zymography. From the three compounds tested, cudraflavone B showed the strongest effects on cell cycle progression and viability of tumor and/or immortalized cells and also on inflammatory response of macrophage-like cells. Kuwanon E and 4'-O-methylkuwanon E exerted more sophisticated rather than direct toxic effect on used cell types. Our data indicate that mechanisms different from stress-related or apoptotic signaling pathways are involved in the action of these compounds.

Indeed, these myeloid cells display pathogenic roles in both diseases and may be an important source of precursors for differentiation of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing multinucleated giant cells. We have recently documented that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A regulates long-term survival of DC by inducing BCL2A1 expression, in addition to the constitutive MCL1 expression. We summarize bibliography of the BCL2 family members and their therapeutic targeting, with a special emphasis on MCL1 and BCL2A1, discussing their potential impact on RA and LCH. Our recent knowledge in the survival pathway, which is activated to perform DC fusion in the presence of IL-17A, suggests that targeting MCL1 and BCL2A1 in infiltrating DC may affect the clinical outcomes in RA and LCH. The development of new therapies, interfering with MCL1 and BCL2A1 expression, to target long-term surviving inflammatory DC should be translated into preclinical studies with the aim to increase the well-being of patients with RA and LCH.","['Olsson Akefeldt, Selma', 'Ismail, Mohamad Bachar', 'Valentin, Helene', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Henter, Jan-Inge', 'Delprat, Christine']","['Olsson Akefeldt S', 'Ismail MB', 'Valentin H', 'Arico M', 'Henter JI', 'Delprat C']","[""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130522,Egypt,Clin Dev Immunol,Clinical & developmental immunology,101183692,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Resorption/immunology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/pharmacology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'Myeloid Cells/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3674653,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/701305 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Dev Immunol. 2013;2013:701305. doi: 10.1155/2013/701305.

Despite its nuclear localization, a small portion of PML has been identified in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic PML (cPML) could be originally derived from the retention of exported nuclear PML (nPML). In addition, bona fide cPML isoforms devoid of nuclear localization signal (NLS) have also been identified.

Chromosome analysis of the patient's bone marrow cells showed 44, XY, -17, -17 in all 20 metaphase spreads. Homoharringtonine was used to control the patient's high white cell count for a short time, although after two weeks, the patient complained of left upper quadrant discomfort and his blood count showed a white blood cell count of 40.8x10(9)/l. However, the patient continued to undergo maintenance therapy and was discharged in good clinical condition with hydroxyurea treatment for 31 months. Usually, patients with CNL have normal karyotypes and no specific cytogenetic abnormalities have been identified. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case in the literature of a patient exhibiting the deletion of chromosome 17 with CNL. We concluded that deleted of tumor suppressor genes located on 17p13.1, such as p53, may be associated with the development of CNL.

Notably, IIi showed significant cytotoxicity in two multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines, with an average resistance factor (RF) of 1.66. Moreover, in mice with S-180 sarcoma xenografts, the intraperitoneal administration of IIi inhibited tumor growth. The immunoblotting study showed that treatment with IIi decreases phosphorylated p70S6K1 and 4EBP1 levels in the human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. In the MCF-7 cells, IIi also significantly increased the expression of cleaved LC3. This indicated that IIi inhibits mTOR activity and induces autophagy.

The results given in this manuscript will allow to (re-)calculate yield of chest CT. PURPOSE: To demonstrate a method to evaluate the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence/mortality due to a single diagnostic investigation in a 1-year cohort of consecutive chest CT for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 1-year cohort of consecutive chest CT for suspected PE using a standard scan protocol was analyzed retrospectively (691 patients, 352 men, 339 women). Normalized patient-specific estimations of the radiation doses received by individual organs were correlated with age- and sex-specific mean predicted cancer incidence and age- and sex-specific predicted cancer mortality based on the BEIR VII results. Additional correlation was provided for natural occurring risks. RESULTS: LAR of cancer incidence/mortality following one chest CT was calculated for cancer of the stomach, colon, liver, lung, breast, uterus, ovaries, bladder, thyroid, and for leukemia. LAR remains very low for all age and sex categories, being highest for cancer of the lungs and breasts in 20-year-old women (0.61% and 0.4%, respectively). Summation of all cancer sites analyzed raised the cumulative relative LAR up to 2.76% in 20-year-old women. CONCLUSION: Using the method presented in this work, LAR of cancer incidence and cancer mortality for a single chest CT for PE seems very low for all age groups and both sexes, but being highest for young patients. Hence the risk for radiation-induced organ cancers must be outweighed with the potential benefit or a treatment and the potential risks of a missed and therefore untreated PE.","['Niemann, T', 'Zbinden, I', 'Roser, H W', 'Bremerich, J', 'Remy-Jardin, M', 'Bongartz, G']","['Niemann T', 'Zbinden I', 'Roser HW', 'Bremerich J', 'Remy-Jardin M', 'Bongartz G']","['Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,England,Acta Radiol,"Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",8706123,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Pulmonary Embolism/*diagnostic imaging', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects']",,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/11/01 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['0284185113485069 [pii]', '10.1177/0284185113485069 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Radiol. 2013 Sep;54(7):778-84. doi: 10.1177/0284185113485069.

This can occur by mechanisms dependent on catalytic activity, resulting in the mutagenic deamination of nascent viral cDNA, and/or by other means that are independent of its catalytic activity. It is not yet known to what extent deamination-independent processes contribute to the overall restriction, how they exactly work or how they are regulated. Here, we show that alanine substitution of either tryptophan 94 (W94A) or 127 (W127A) in the non-catalytic N-terminal domain of A3G severely impedes RNA binding and alleviates deamination-independent restriction while still maintaining DNA mutator activity. Substitution of both tryptophans (W94A/W127A) produces a more severe phenotype in which RNA binding and RNA-dependent protein oligomerization are completely abrogated. We further demonstrate that RNA binding is specifically required for crippling late reverse transcript accumulation, preventing proviral DNA integration and, consequently, restricting viral particle release. We did not find that deaminase activity made a significant contribution to the restriction of any of these processes. In summary, this work reveals that there is a direct correlation between A3G's capacity to bind RNA and its ability to inhibit retroviral infectivity in a deamination-independent manner.","['Belanger, Kasandra', 'Savoie, Mathieu', 'Rosales Gerpe, Maria Carla', 'Couture, Jean-Francois', 'Langlois, Marc-Andre']","['Belanger K', 'Savoie M', 'Rosales Gerpe MC', 'Couture JF', 'Langlois MA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8M5, Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8M5, Emerging Pathogens Research Centre, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8M5 and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8M5.']",['eng'],['89774/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130612,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Alanine/genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', '*Catalytic Domain', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Deamination', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Multimerization', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Tryptophan/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Release']",PMC3753645,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/10/29 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt527 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt527 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Aug;41(15):7438-52. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt527.

In the past decade, many computational methods have been proposed, resulting in great improvements on various levels, including feature selection and algorithms for classification and clustering. In this study, we present iPcc, a novel method from the feature extraction perspective to further propel gene expression profiling technologies from bench to bedside. We define 'correlation feature space' for samples based on the gene expression profiles by iterative employment of Pearson's correlation coefficient. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real gene expression data sets demonstrate that iPcc can greatly highlight the latent patterns underlying noisy gene expression data and thus greatly improve the robustness and accuracy of the algorithms currently available for disease diagnosis and classification based on gene expression profiles.","['Ren, Xianwen', 'Wang, Yong', 'Zhang, Xiang-Sun', 'Jin, Qi']","['Ren X', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang XS', 'Jin Q']","['MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130612,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Classification/methods', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures', 'Disease/*classification/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Psoriasis/classification/genetics']",PMC3737526,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/11/05 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt343 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt343 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Aug;41(14):e143. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt343.

We report a case of severe disseminated toxoplasmosis that developed early after allogeneic HSCT for T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma in a 15-year-old Toxoplasma gondii-seropositive boy with Nijmegen breakage syndrome, a rare genetic DNA repair disorder associated with immunodeficiency. The donor was the patient's HLA-identical brother. Prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole was discontinued a day before the HSCT procedure. Signs of lung infection appeared as early as day 14 post-HSCT. The presence of tachyzoite-like structures on Giemsa-stained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid smears suggested toxoplasmosis. Real-time PCR targeted at the T. gondii AF146527 gene revealed extremely high parasite burdens in both blood and BAL fluid. Although immediate introduction of specific treatment resulted in a marked reduction of the parasite load and transient clinical improvement, the patient deteriorated and died of multiple organ failure on day 39 post-HSCT. Direct genotyping of T. gondii DNA from blood and BAL fluid with the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method revealed type II alleles with SAG1, SAG2, and GRA6 markers but alleles of both type I and type II with GRA7. Additional analysis with 15 microsatellite markers showed that the T. gondii DNA was atypical and genetically divergent from that of the clonal type I, II, and III strains.

He had been diagnosed with Richter's syndrome three months earlier: a bulky tumor was seen on the backside of the stomach in a routine gastroscopy. Taking a biopsy had resulted in a major bleeding impossible to stop endoscopically. An emergency surgical multi-visceral resection was performed. The first cycle of chemotherapy was administered about 4 weeks prior to the present appointment. INVESTIGATIONS: In the physical examination the patient showed a bad orientation and confusion together with a skinny habitus. The initially performed lab tests and a CT-Scan of the brain did not show a significant finding. A mini-mental-state-examination (MMSE) showed moderate cognitive impairment. In a psychiatric consultation the patient was diagnosed with reactive depression and a corresponding medication was given. After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient's state of mind decreased markedly within days. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND FURTHER COURSE: The further diagnostic investigation (MRI of the brain, lumbar puncture) brought the diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The administration of chemotherapy was stopped then. Three weeks after the diagnosis the patient died in the hospice. CONCLUSION: If a patient develops neurological or psychiatric symptoms during therapy with rituximab clinicians should be aware of the potential diagnosis of PML and initiate further investigations.","['Kullmer, A', 'Herrmann, G', 'Riecken, B']","['Kullmer A', 'Herrmann G', 'Riecken B']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin, Gastroenterologie, Hamato-Onkologie, Infektiologie und Diabetologie, Ludwigsburg. armin.kuellmer@kliniken-lb.de']",['ger'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20130612,Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cognition Disorders/*chemically induced/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*chemically induced/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1343241 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2013 Jun;138(25-26):1355-9. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1343241.

In the present work, we used the NCI panel of 60 human tumor cell lines to identify the most sensitive cell lines and drugs with comparable cytotoxicity profiles. GI50 values of BBAS ranged between 0.12 and 6.5 muM. Activity was higher than average for leukemia and melanoma cell lines, especially SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-28, for the COLO-205 and HT-29 (colorectal) and MDA-MB-468 (breast) cancer cell lines. We evaluated the correlation between the GI50 of BBAS and those of 125 antiproliferative compounds with various mechanisms of action, using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, and we observed a highly significant correlation with the GI50s of nitrosoureas. Interestingly, BBAS cytotoxicity was inversely correlated with the expression levels of MGMT (p = 0.009), an enzyme involved in the repair of nitrosourea-induced DNA damage. However, no correlation was found with the expression of 102 other genes involved in DNA repair. Antitumor activity was tested on immunodeficient mice with subcutaneously xenografted COLO-205, HT-29, MDA-MB-468, SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-28 cell lines. At 10 mg/kg, there was a significant reduction in tumor size with T/C values of 41 % and 43 % for COLO-205 and SK-MEL-28 cell lines, respectively. The drug was less active on HT-29 and SK-MEL-5 and inactive on MDA-MB-468 xenografts. Cell cycle studies showed an accumulation of BBAS-treated cells in G2/M phase after treatment at 20 muM. Together, our results allowed the identification of a potentially new class of anticancer agent displaying a mechanism of action related to that of nitrosoureas.","['Chodoeva, Ainura', 'Bosc, Jean-Jacques', 'Lartigue, Lydia', 'Guillon, Jean', 'Auzanneau, Celine', 'Costet, Pierre', 'Zurdinov, Ashiraly', 'Jarry, Christian', 'Robert, Jacques']","['Chodoeva A', 'Bosc JJ', 'Lartigue L', 'Guillon J', 'Auzanneau C', 'Costet P', 'Zurdinov A', 'Jarry C', 'Robert J']","[""Institut Bergonie, INSERM U916, Universite Bordeaux Segalen, 229 cours de l'Argonne, 33076, Bordeaux, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130613,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '369U7A6HXD (benzoylaconine)', 'X8YN71D5WC (Aconitine)']",IM,"['Aconitine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Aconitum/*chemistry', 'Alkaloids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mice']",,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/10/08 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-013-9986-z [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2014 Feb;32(1):60-7. doi: 10.1007/s10637-013-9986-z.

METHODS: In this study, we evaluated a strategy to individualize HDMTX based on clearance of each individual's previous course of HDMTX in 485 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Doses were individualized to achieve a steady-state plasma concentration (Cpss) of 33 or 65 muM (approximately 2.5 or 5 g/m(2)/day) for low- and standard-/high-risk patients, respectively. RESULTS: Individualized doses resulted in 70 and 63 % of courses being within 20 % of the targeted Cpss in the low- and standard-/high-risk arms, respectively, compared to 60 % (p < 0.001) and 61 % (p = 0.43) with conventionally dosed therapy. Only 1.3 % of the individualized courses in the standard-/high-risk arm had a Cpss greater than 50 % above the target compared to 7.3 % (p < 0.001) in conventionally dosed therapy. We observed a low rate (8.5 % of courses) of grade 3-4 toxicities. The odds of gastrointestinal toxicity were related to methotrexate plasma concentrations in both the low (p = 0.021)- and standard-/high-risk groups (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Individualizing HDMTX based on the clearance from the prior course resulted in fewer extreme Cpss values and less delayed excretion compared to conventional dosing.","['Pauley, Jennifer L', 'Panetta, John C', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'McCormick, John', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Pauley JL', 'Panetta JC', 'Crews KR', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'McCormick J', 'Howard SC', 'Sandlund JT', 'Jeha S', 'Ribeiro R', 'Rubnitz J', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA.""]",['eng'],"['U01 GM92666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130613,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antidotes)', '0 (Antimetabolites)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antidotes/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Models, Biological', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",PMC3719000,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-013-2206-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2013 Aug;72(2):369-78. doi: 10.1007/s00280-013-2206-x.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 365 patients with IPSS low or intermediate-1 risk MDS who had at least two consecutive cytogenetic analyses during the follow up. Acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities was detected in 107 patients (29%). The most frequent alteration involved chromosome 7 in 21% of ACA cases. Median transformation-free and overall survival for patients with and without ACA were 13 vs. 52 months (P = 0.01) and 17 vs. 62 months (P = 0.01), respectively. By fitting ACA as a time-dependent covariate, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients with ACA had increased risk of transformation (HR = 1.40; P = 0.03) or death (HR = 1.45; P = 0.02). Notably, female patients with therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) had an increased risk of developing ACA (OR = 5.26; P < 0.0001), although subgroup analysis showed that prognostic impact of ACA was not evident in t-MDS. In conclusion, ACA occurs in close to one third of patients with IPSS defined lower risk MDS, more common among patients with t-MDS, but has a significant prognostic impact on de novo MDS.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Cornelison, A Megan', 'Abruzzo, Lynne', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Estrov, Zeev', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Mallo, Mar', 'Wierda, William', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Wei, Yue', 'Sole, Francisco', 'Chen, Rui', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Jabbour E', 'Takahashi K', 'Wang X', 'Cornelison AM', 'Abruzzo L', 'Kadia T', 'Borthakur G', 'Estrov Z', ""O'Brien S"", 'Mallo M', 'Wierda W', 'Pierce S', 'Wei Y', 'Sole F', 'Chen R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",PMC3923606,['NIHMS549015'],2013/06/14 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23513 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Oct;88(10):831-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23513.

Down-regulation of Mcl-1 by a small interfering (siRNA) or an inhibitor of JNK significantly potentiated the ability of ATRA to induce differentiation and apoptosis in these cells. On the other hand, the anti-leukemia effects of ATRA were blunted when Mcl-1 was forced expressed in NB4 and PL-21 cells as well as leukemia cells isolated from individuals with APL. Furthermore, down-regulation of Mcl-1 by an siRNA sensitized non-APL U937 and KG-1 leukemia cells to ATRA-mediated differentiation and apoptosis. Taken together, inhibition of Mcl-1 might be useful to potentiate the action of ATRA in APL as well as non-APL AML cells.","['Yang, Jing', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Nishioka, Chie', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Yang J', 'Ikezoe T', 'Nishioka C', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8505, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8505, Japan. ikezoet@kochi-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8505, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8505, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10495-013-0872-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-013-0872-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Nov;18(11):1403-1415. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0872-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The greatest difference between the CCI curves at 5 years after initiating imatinib therapy was observed for the BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 3 months. The 5-year CCI was 94.3% in patients with BCR-ABL1 transcripts </= 10% and 57.1% in patients with BCR-ABL1 transcripts > 10% (P = 0.005). Therefore, the examination of BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 3 months may help in early identification of patients who are likely to perform poorly with imatinib.

PML pleiotropic role is in part related to its ability to localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the nucleus, PML is known to regulate gene transcription, a role linked to its ability to associate with transcription factors as well as chromatin-remodelers. A new twist came from the discovery that the PML-interacting protein death-associated protein 6 (DAXX) acts as chaperone for the histone H3.3 variant. H3.3 is found enriched at active genes, centromeric heterochromatin, and telomeres, and has been proposed to act as important carrier of epigenetic information. Our recent work has implicated DAXX in regulation of H3.3 loading and transcription in the central nervous system (CNS). Remarkably, driver mutations in H3.3 and/or its loading machinery have been identified in brain cancer, thus suggesting a role for altered H3.3 function/deposition in CNS tumorigenesis. Aberrant H3.3 deposition may also play a role in leukemia pathogenesis, given DAXX role in PML-RARalpha-driven transformation and the identification of a DAXX missense mutation in acute myeloid leukemia. This review aims to critically discuss the existing literature and propose new avenues for investigation.","['Salomoni, Paolo']",['Salomoni P'],"['Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, UCL Cancer Institute , University College London, London , UK.']",['eng'],['MC_U132670601/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],['Journal Article'],20130607,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC3675705,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/06/14 06:01,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00152 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 Jun 7;3:152. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00152. eCollection 2013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['DAXX', 'PML', 'cancer', 'epigenetics', 'histone variant']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Drosophlia PDCD2 ortholog Zfrp8 has an essential function in fly hematopoiesis. Zfrp8 mutants exhibit marked lymph gland hyperplasia that results from increased proliferation of partially differentiated hemocytes, suggesting Zfrp8 may participate in cell growth. Based on the above observations we have focused on the role of PDCD2 in human cancer cell proliferation and hypothesized that aberrant PDCD2 expression may be characteristic of human malignancies. We report that PDCD2 is highly expressed in human acute leukemia cells as well as in normal hematopoietic progenitors. PDCD2 knockdown in cancer cells impairs their proliferation, but not viability relative to parental cells, supporting the notion that PDCD2 overexpression facilitates cancer cell growth. Prospective analysis of PDCD2 in acute leukemia patients indicates PDCD2 RNA expression correlates with disease status and is a significant predictor of clinical relapse. PDCD2's role in cell proliferation and its high expression in human malignancies make it an attractive, novel potential molecular target for new anti-cancer therapies.","['Barboza, Nora', 'Minakhina, Svetlana', 'Medina, Daniel J', 'Balsara, Binaifer', 'Greenwood, Sonya', 'Huzzy, Lien', 'Rabson, Arnold B', 'Steward, Ruth', 'Schaar, Dale G']","['Barboza N', 'Minakhina S', 'Medina DJ', 'Balsara B', 'Greenwood S', 'Huzzy L', 'Rabson AB', 'Steward R', 'Schaar DG']","['University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PDCD2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3813571,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['24484 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.24484 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2013 Jun;14(6):546-55. doi: 10.4161/cbt.24484.,,['NOTNLM'],"['PDCD2', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myelogenous leukemia', 'cellular proliferation', 'hematopoietic stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One pharmacological approach to improve patient response is to design targeted therapies that exploit the cancer milieu by reductively activating prodrugs, which results in the selective release of the free drug in the tumor tissue. Previously, we characterized prodrugs of seco-CBI-indole 2 (CBI-indole 2) designed to be activated in hypoxic tumor microenvironments, wherein the tumor maintains higher concentrations of ""reducing"" nucleophiles capable of preferentially releasing the free drug by nucleophilic attack on a weak N-O bond. Of these prodrugs, BocNHO-CBI-indole 2 (BocNHO) surpassed the efficacy of the free drug, CBI-indole 2, when examined in vivo in the murine L1210 leukemia model and demonstrated reduced toxicity suggesting a targeted or sustained release in vivo. Herein, we further examine the biological activity of the BocNHO prodrug in murine breast cancer, as well as human prostate and lung cancer cell lines, in vitro. Notably, BocNHO manifests potent antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity in all three tumor cell lines. However, in comparison to the activity observed in the murine cancer cell line, the human cancer cell lines were less sensitive, especially at early timepoints for cytotoxicity. Based on these findings, BocNHO was tested in a more clinically relevant orthotopic lung tumor model, revealing significant efficacy and reduced toxicity compared with the free drug. The data suggests that this pharmacological approach to designing targeted therapies is amenable to human solid tumors.","['Vielhauer, George A', 'Swink, Megan', 'Parelkar, Nikhil K', 'Lajiness, James P', 'Wolfe, Amanda L', 'Boger, Dale']","['Vielhauer GA', 'Swink M', 'Parelkar NK', 'Lajiness JP', 'Wolfe AL', 'Boger D']","['Department of Urology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA. gvielhauer@kumc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Prodrugs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbamates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3813569,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['24348 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.24348 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2013 Jun;14(6):527-36. doi: 10.4161/cbt.24348.,,['NOTNLM'],"['breast', 'cancer', 'duocarmycin', 'lung', 'orthotopic tumor model', 'prodrug', 'prostate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this effector function is limited, because CLL cells are protected from complement-induced damage by regulators of complement activation (RCAs). A prominent RCA in fluid phase is factor H (fH), which has not been investigated in this context yet. Here, we show that fH binds to CLL cells and that human recombinant fH-derived short-consensus repeat 18-20 (hSCR18-20) interferes with this binding. In complement-based lysis assays, CLL cells from therapy-naive patients were differently susceptible to RTX-induced CDC and were defined as CDC responder or CDC non-responder, respectively. In CDC responders, but notably also in non-responders, hSCR18-20 significantly boosted RTX-induced CDC. Killing of the cells was specific for CD20(+) cells, whereas CD20(-) cells were poorly affected. CDC resistance was independent of expression of the membrane-anchored RCAs CD55 and CD59, although blocking of these RCAs further boosted CDC. Thus, inhibition of fH binding by hSCR18-20 sensitizes CLL cells to CDC and may provide a novel strategy for improving RTX-containing immunochemotherapy of CLL patients.","['Horl, S', 'Banki, Z', 'Huber, G', 'Ejaz, A', 'Windisch, D', 'Muellauer, B', 'Willenbacher, E', 'Steurer, M', 'Stoiber, H']","['Horl S', 'Banki Z', 'Huber G', 'Ejaz A', 'Windisch D', 'Muellauer B', 'Willenbacher E', 'Steurer M', 'Stoiber H']","['Division of Virology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['P 21508/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130613,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CFH protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '80295-65-4 (Complement Factor H)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Complement Activation/*immunology', 'Complement Factor H/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3826035,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013169 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.169 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Nov;27(11):2200-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.169.

Lenalidomide-resistant models were found to overexpress the hyaluronan (HA)-binding protein CD44, a downstream Wnt/beta-catenin transcriptional target. Consistent with a role of CD44 in cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR), lenalidomide-resistant myeloma cells were more adhesive to bone marrow stroma and HA-coated plates. Blockade of CD44 with monoclonal antibodies, free HA or CD44 knockdown reduced adhesion and sensitized to lenalidomide. Wnt/beta-catenin suppression by FH535 enhanced the activity of lenalidomide, as did interleukin-6 neutralization with siltuximab. Notably, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) downregulated total beta-catenin, cell-surface and total CD44, reduced adhesion of lenalidomide-resistant myeloma cells and enhanced the activity of lenalidomide in a lenalidomide-resistant in vivo murine xenograft model. Finally, ATRA sensitized primary myeloma samples from patients that had relapsed and/or refractory disease after lenalidomide therapy to this immunomodulatory agent ex vivo. Taken together, our findings support the hypotheses that CD44 and CAM-DR contribute to lenalidomide resistance in multiple myeloma, that CD44 should be evaluated as a putative biomarker of sensitivity to lenalidomide, and that ATRA or other approaches that target CD44 may overcome clinical lenalidomide resistance.","['Bjorklund, C C', 'Baladandayuthapani, V', 'Lin, H Y', 'Jones, R J', 'Kuiatse, I', 'Wang, H', 'Yang, J', 'Shah, J J', 'Thomas, S K', 'Wang, M', 'Weber, D M', 'Orlowski, R Z']","['Bjorklund CC', 'Baladandayuthapani V', 'Lin HY', 'Jones RJ', 'Kuiatse I', 'Wang H', 'Yang J', 'Shah JJ', 'Thomas SK', 'Wang M', 'Weber DM', 'Orlowski RZ']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas M.

We examined TRM rates in 1409 patients treated on SWOG (Southwest Oncology Group) trials and 1942 patients treated at MD Anderson (MDA) from 1991 to 2009. Eighty-eight percent of SWOG patients received '3+7' or regimens of similar intensity while 92% of the MDA patients received ara-C at 1.5-2.0 g/m(2) daily x 3-5 days+other cytotoxic agents. We examined the relationship between time and TRM rates after accounting for other covariates. TRM rates between 1991 and 2009 decreased from 18-3% in SWOG and 16-4% at MDA. Multivariate analyses showed a significant decrease in TRM over time (P=0.001). The decrease in TRM was not limited to younger patients, those with a better performance status or a lower white blood cell count. Though our observations are limited to patients treated with intensive therapy at SWOG institutions and MDA, the decrease in TRM with time emphasizes the problem with historical controls and could be considered when selecting AML induction therapy.","['Othus, M', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Petersdorf, S', 'Ravandi, F', 'Godwin, J', 'Cortes, J', 'Pierce, S', 'Erba, H', 'Faderl, S', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Estey, E']","['Othus M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Petersdorf S', 'Ravandi F', 'Godwin J', 'Cortes J', 'Pierce S', 'Erba H', 'Faderl S', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Estey E']","[""Public Health Sciences Division's Biostatistics and Biomathematics Group, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."", 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Public Health Sciences Division's Biostatistics and Biomathematics Group, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."", 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology Division, Southern Illinois University, Springfield, IL, USA.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hematologic Malignancy Program, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Public Health Sciences Division's Biostatistics and Biomathematics Group, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."", ""Public Health Sciences Division's Biostatistics and Biomathematics Group, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA038926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180855/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20130613,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4457325,['NIHMS693928'],2013/06/14 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013176 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.176 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Feb;28(2):289-92. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.176.

The genome of FV3 is 105,903 bases in length and encodes 97 open reading frames (ORFs). The FV3 ORF 97R contains a B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) homology 1 (BH1) domain and has sequence similarity to the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein, suggesting a potential role in apoptosis. To begin to understand the role of 97R, we characterized 97R through immunofluorescence and mutagenesis. Here we demonstrated that 97R localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at 24 h posttransfection. However, at 35 h posttransfection, 97R localized to the ER but also began to form concentrated pockets continuous with the nuclear membrane. After 48 h posttransfection, 97R was still localized to the ER, but we began to observe the ER and the outer nuclear membrane invaginating into the nucleus. To further explore 97R targeting to the ER, we created a series of C-terminal transmembrane domain deletion mutants. We found that deletion of 29 amino acids from the C terminus of 97R abolished localization to the ER. In contrast, deletion of 12 amino acids from the C terminus of 97R did not affect 97R localization to the ER. In addition, a hybrid protein containing the 97R C-terminal 33 amino acids was similarly targeted to the ER. These data indicate that the C-terminal 33 amino acids of 97R are necessary and sufficient for ER targeting.","['Ring, Brooke A', 'Ferreira Lacerda, Andressa', 'Drummond, Dylan J', 'Wangen, Christina', 'Eaton, Heather E', 'Brunetti, Craig R']","['Ring BA', 'Ferreira Lacerda A', 'Drummond DJ', 'Wangen C', 'Eaton HE', 'Brunetti CR']","['Department of Biology, Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130612,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/chemistry/*metabolism/*virology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Transport', 'Ranavirus/*physiology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",PMC3754063,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00637-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00637-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Aug;87(16):9199-207. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00637-13.

The underlying mechanisms and prognostic implications of these cytogenetic abnormalities are discussed in the present study.","['Al-Achkar, Walid', 'Wafa, Abdulsamad', 'Ikhtiar, Adnan', 'Liehr, Thomas']","['Al-Achkar W', 'Wafa A', 'Ikhtiar A', 'Liehr T']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Human Genetics Division, Flow-cytometry Lab, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria ;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130305,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC3678570,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/06/14 06:01,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2013.1228 [doi]', 'ol-05-05-1656 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2013 May;5(5):1656-1658. doi: 10.3892/ol.2013.1228.

A common activating mutation is an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in the FLT3 gene that is found in approximately 25% of patients and confers a poor prognosis. FLT3 inhibitors have been developed and have some efficacy, but patients often relapse. Levels of FLT3 ligand (FL) are significantly elevated in patients during chemotherapy and may be an important component contributing to relapse. We used a mouse model to investigate the possible effect of FL expression on leukemogenesis involving FLT3-ITD mutations in an in vivo system. FLT3(ITD/ITD) FL(-/-) (knockout) mice had a statistically significant increase in survival compared with FLT3(ITD/ITD) FL(+/+) (wildtype) mice, most of which developed a fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm. These findings suggest that FL levels may have prognostic significance in human patients. We also studied the effect of FL expression on survival in a FLT3-ITD NUP98-HOX13 (NHD13) fusion mouse model. These mice develop an aggressive leukemia with short latency. We asked whether FL expression played a similar role in this context. The NUP98-HOX13 FLT3(ITD/wt) FL(-/-) mice did not have a survival advantage, compared with NUP98-HOX13 FLT3(ITD/wt) FL(+/+) mice (normal FL levels). The loss of the survival advantage of the FL knockout group in the NUP98-HOX13 model suggests that adding a second mutation changes the effect of FL expression in the context of more aggressive disease.","['Bailey, Emily J', 'Duffield, Amy S', 'Greenblatt, Sarah M', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Small, Donald']","['Bailey EJ', 'Duffield AS', 'Greenblatt SM', 'Aplan PD', 'Small D']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA090668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA070970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Comp Med,Comparative medicine,100900466,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Models, Animal', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*physiology']",PMC3690427,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/01/16 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Comp Med. 2013 Jun;63(3):218-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies performed in our laboratory the drug was found to induce a substantial increase of telomerase activity in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Aim of the present investigation was to test whether saquinavir was able to increase telomerase activity and the expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT, in human malignant hematopoietic cells. METHODS: Human Jurkat CD4+ T cell leukaemia cell line was used throughout the present study. The antiproliferative effect of saquinavir was tested by the MTT assay. Telomerase activity was determined according to the telomeric repeat amplification protocol. The expression of hTERT mRNA was semi-quantitative evaluated by RT-PCR amplification and quantitative Real Time PCR. The binding of the transcription factor c-Myc to its specific E-Box DNA binding-site of hTERT promoter was analyzed by Electophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). The amount of c-Myc in cytoplasm and nucleus of leukemia cells was determined by Western Blot analysis, and c-Myc down-regulation was obtained by siRNA transfection. RESULTS: Saquinavir produced a substantial increase of telomerase activity in Jurkat cells in vitro without increasing but rather reducing target cell proliferation rate. Telomerase up-regulation appeared to be the result of enhanced expression of hTERT. Saquinavir-mediated up-regulation of hTERT gene was the result of the increased binding of proteins to the E-Box sequence of the promoter. Moreover, saquinavir amplified the expression of c-Myc especially in the nuclear cell fraction. The direct influence of saquinavir on this transcription factor was also demonstrated by the antagonistic effect of the drug on siRNA induced c-Myc suppression. Since c-Myc is the main responsible for hTERT transcription, these findings suggest that the main mechanism underlying saquinavir-induced telomerase activation is mediated by c-Myc up-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Saquinavir augments hTERT expression while inhibiting leukemic cell growth. Experimental evidences show that this effect is mediated by saquinavir-influenced increase of c-Myc levels. This could have relevance in terms of enhanced hTERT-dependent tumor cell immunogenicity and suggests new paharmacological approaches interfering with c-Myc dependent pathways.","['Adamo, Riccardo', 'Comandini, Alessandro', 'Aquino, Angelo', 'Bonmassar, Laura', 'Guglielmi, Loredana', 'Bonmassar, Enzo', 'Franzese, Ornella']","['Adamo R', 'Comandini A', 'Aquino A', 'Bonmassar L', 'Guglielmi L', 'Bonmassar E', 'Franzese O']","['Department of Systems Medicine, Pharmacology Section, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130608,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'L3JE09KZ2F (Saquinavir)']",IM,"['Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Saquinavir/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Telomerase/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",PMC3682913,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/12/20 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-32-38 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-32-38 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 8;32:38. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-32-38.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in younger patients with a low rate of co-morbidities less than 50% of patients can be cured. For older patients or patients with significant co-morbidities, the situation appears even worse. In patients not eligible for intensive treatment approaches - e.g. due to underlying medical conditions - therapeutic approaches remain almost exclusively palliative. However, even with less intense treatment approaches, temporary remission can be achieved and this contributes to prolonged survival and improved quality of life of the respective patient. Targeted therapies have been widely used as palliative treatment in- and outside clinical trials as single agents. Combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) potentially improves remission rates and can be safely administered in an outpatient setting.Previous studies showed that additive hematologic toxicity of combinatory therapeutic approaches may arise from simultaneous treatment (e.g. chemotherapy plus targeted therapies). However, sequential therapies have already proven their feasibility in clinical trials. Here, we report two cases of rapid induction of complete molecular remission by sequential therapy with LDAC and sorafenib in patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy without significant long-term toxicity.","['Wolleschak, Denise', 'Schalk, Enrico', 'Krogel, Christian', 'Schnoeder, Tina M', 'Luehr, Helga', 'Jentsch-Ullrich, Kathleen', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Heidel, Florian H']","['Wolleschak D', 'Schalk E', 'Krogel C', 'Schnoeder TM', 'Luehr H', 'Jentsch-Ullrich K', 'Fischer T', 'Heidel FH']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Center of Internal Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke University Medical Center, Leipziger Str, 44, Magdeburg D-39120, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20130611,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Sorafenib', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3686641,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-39 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-39 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jun 11;6:39. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of BCL11A in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. RESULTS: We examined BCL11A expression at the protein and mRNA levels in a cohort (n=114) of NSCLC patients and assessed the relationship between BCL11A expression and clinicopathological parameters. Data from array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) and microRNA transfection experiments were integrated to explore the potential mechanisms of abnormal BCL11A activation in NSCLC. Compared to adjacent non-cancerous lung tissues, BCL11A expression levels were specifically upregulated in NSCLC tissues at both the mRNA (t=9.81, P<0.001) and protein levels. BCL11A protein levels were higher in patients with squamous histology (chi2=15.81, P=0.001), smokers (chi2=8.92, P=0.004), patients with no lymph node involvement (chi2=5.14, P=0.029), and patients with early stage disease (chi2=3.91, P=0.048). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that in early stage NSCLC (IA-IIB), BCL11A was not only an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (hazards ratio [HR] 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.50, P<0.001), but also for overall survival (HR=0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61, P=0.003). The average BCL11A expression level was much higher in SCC samples with amplifications than in those without amplifications (t=3.30, P=0.023). Assessing functionality via an in vitro luciferase reporter system and western blotting, we found that the BCL11A protein was a target of miR-30a. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that proto-oncogene BCL11A activation induced by miR-30a and gene amplification may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for effective management of this disease.","['Jiang, Ben-yuan', 'Zhang, Xu-chao', 'Su, Jian', 'Meng, Wei', 'Yang, Xue-ning', 'Yang, Jin-ji', 'Zhou, Qing', 'Chen, Zhi-yong', 'Chen, Zhi-hong', 'Xie, Zhi', 'Chen, Shi-liang', 'Wu, Yi-long']","['Jiang BY', 'Zhang XC', 'Su J', 'Meng W', 'Yang XN', 'Yang JJ', 'Zhou Q', 'Chen ZY', 'Chen ZH', 'Xie Z', 'Chen SL', 'Wu YL']","['Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, 106 Zhongshan Er Rd, Guangzhou, 510080, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130612,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN30b microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Repressor Proteins']",PMC3695801,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-61 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-61 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 Jun 12;12:61. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the direct links between the deleterious mutations or deletions in these two genes and several human disorders, such as inherited inflammatory calcified tumors and acute myeloid leukemia, suggest their biological importance. SAMD9 and SAMD9L have also recently been shown to play key roles in the innate immune responses to stimuli such as viral infection. We were particularly interested in understanding the mammalian evolutionary history of these two genes. The phylogeny of SAMD9 and SAMD9L genes was reconstructed using the Maximum Likelihood method. Furthermore, six different methods were applied to detect SAMD9 and SAMD9L codons under selective pressure: the site-specific model M8 implemented in the codeml program in PAML software and five methods available on the Datamonkey web server, including the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting method, the Fixed Effect Likelihood method, the Random Effect Likelihood method, the Mixed Effects Model of Evolution method and the Fast Unbiased Bayesian AppRoximation method. Additionally, the house mouse (Mus musculus) genome has lost the SAMD9 gene, while keeping SAMD9L intact, prompting us to investigate whether this loss is a unique event during evolution. RESULTS: Our evolutionary analyses suggest that SAMD9 and SAMD9L arose through an ancestral gene duplication event after the divergence of Marsupialia from Placentalia. Additionally, selection analyses demonstrated that both genes have been subjected to positive evolutionary selection. The absence of either SAMD9 or SAMD9L genes from some mammalian species supports a partial functional redundancy between the two genes. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study on the evolutionary history of mammalian SAMD9 and SAMD9L genes. We conclude that evolutionary selective pressure has acted on both of these two genes since their divergence, suggesting their importance in multiple cellular processes, such as the immune responses to viral pathogens.","['Lemos de Matos, Ana', 'Liu, Jia', 'McFadden, Grant', 'Esteves, Pedro J']","['Lemos de Matos A', 'Liu J', 'McFadden G', 'Esteves PJ']","['Centro de Investigacao em Biodiversidade e Recursos Geneticos/InBio Laboratorio Associado, Universidade do Porto, 4485-661 Vairao, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['P30 AI036214/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI080607/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130612,England,BMC Evol Biol,BMC evolutionary biology,100966975,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SAMD9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bayes Theorem', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Duplication', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mammals/classification/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Multigene Family', 'Phylogeny', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics']",PMC3685527,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/06/15 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2148-13-121 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2148-13-121 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Evol Biol. 2013 Jun 12;13:121. doi: 10.1186/1471-2148-13-121.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously identified peptide IN inhibitors derived from the alpha-helical regions along the dimeric interface of HIV-1 IN. Herein, we show that appropriate hydrocarbon stapling of these peptides to stabilize their helical structure remarkably improves the cell permeability, thus allowing inhibition of the HIV-1 replication in cell culture. Furthermore, the stabilized peptides inhibit the interaction of IN with the cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75. Cellular uptake of the stapled peptide was confirmed in four different cell lines using a fluorescein-labeled analogue. Given their enhanced potency and cell permeability, these stapled peptides can serve as not only lead IN inhibitors but also prototypical biochemical probes or ""nanoneedles"" for the elucidation of HIV-1 IN dimerization and host cofactor interactions within their native cellular environment.","['Long, Ya-Qiu', 'Huang, Shao-Xu', 'Zawahir, Zahrah', 'Xu, Zhong-Liang', 'Li, Huiyuan', 'Sanchez, Tino W', 'Zhi, Ying', 'De Houwer, Stephanie', 'Christ, Frauke', 'Debyser, Zeger', 'Neamati, Nouri']","['Long YQ', 'Huang SX', 'Zawahir Z', 'Xu ZL', 'Li H', 'Sanchez TW', 'Zhi Y', 'De Houwer S', 'Christ F', 'Debyser Z', 'Neamati N']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.']",['eng'],"['R21 AI081610/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21AI081610/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (PSIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (HIV Integrase)', 'YY6481J2FF (p31 integrase protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biocatalysis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HIV Integrase/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",PMC6188661,['NIHMS497865'],2013/06/14 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm4006516 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2013 Jul 11;56(13):5601-12. doi: 10.1021/jm4006516.

This investigator-initiated, non-randomized, open-label phase II multi-centre study included 63 patients (19 essential thrombocythaemia, 44 polycythaemia vera) from 15 centres. The primary objective was to evaluate if vorinostat was followed by a decline in clonal myeloproliferation as defined by European Leukaemia Net. Thirty patients (48%) completed the intervention period (24 weeks of therapy). An intention-to-treat response rate of 35% was identified. Pruritus was resolved [19% to 0% (P = 0.06)] and the prevalence of splenomegaly was lowered from 50% to 27% (P = 0.03). Sixty-five per cent of the patients experienced a decrease in JAK2 V617F allele burden (P = 0.006). Thirty-three patients (52% of patients) discontinued study drug before end of intervention due to adverse events (28 patients) or lack of response (5 patients). In conclusion, vorinostat showed effectiveness by normalizing elevated leucocyte and platelet counts, resolving pruritus and significantly reducing splenomegaly. However, vorinostat was associated with significant side effects resulting in a high discontinuation rate. A lower dose of vorinostat in combination with conventional and/or novel targeted therapies may be warranted in future studies.","['Andersen, Christen L', 'McMullin, Mary F', 'Ejerblad, Elisabeth', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Harrison, Claire', 'Fernandes, Savio', 'Bareford, David', 'Knapper, Steven', 'Samuelsson, Jan', 'Lofvenberg, Eva', 'Linder, Olle', 'Andreasson, Bjorn', 'Ahlstrand, Erik', 'Jensen, Morten K', 'Bjerrum, Ole W', 'Vestergaard, Hanne', 'Larsen, Herdis', 'Klausen, Tobias W', 'Mourits-Andersen, Torben', 'Hasselbalch, Hans C']","['Andersen CL', 'McMullin MF', 'Ejerblad E', 'Zweegman S', 'Harrison C', 'Fernandes S', 'Bareford D', 'Knapper S', 'Samuelsson J', 'Lofvenberg E', 'Linder O', 'Andreasson B', 'Ahlstrand E', 'Jensen MK', 'Bjerrum OW', 'Vestergaard H', 'Larsen H', 'Klausen TW', 'Mourits-Andersen T', 'Hasselbalch HC']","['Department of Haematology, Roskilde Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark. christenla@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130611,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vorinostat']",,,2013/06/14 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12416 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Aug;162(4):498-508. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12416.

With the long-term goal of developing immunological criteria for managing IM therapy in CML patients, we compared the immunophenotypic profiles of three groups of CML patients: those who received IM and had a CMR for more than two consecutive years (CMR group); patients who received IM and did not have a sustained CMR but maintained a major molecular response for more than 2 years (fluctuating CMR group); and patients with a sustained CMR for more than 6 months after IM discontinuation (STOP-IM group), together with healthy controls. The percentages of effector populations of natural killer (NK) cells, such as interferon (IFN)-gamma(+) CD3(-) CD56(+) cells, were significantly higher in the STOP-IM and CMR groups than in the fluctuating CMR and control groups. The elevated levels of these effector NK cells were sustained for more than 3 years after IM discontinuation. In contrast, the percentages of effector memory CD8(+) T cells, such as IFN-gamma(+) CCR7(-) CD45RO(+) CD8(+) cells, were significantly higher in the STOP-IM and control groups than in the CMR and fluctuating CMR groups, possibly owing to IM intake. These results suggest that the immunological activation status of NK cells contributes to CMR maintenance. Higher activation levels of effector NK cells in CML patients being treated with IM might reflect minimization of BCR-ABL1 transcript levels and therefore could be additive information for determining whether to stop IM.","['Mizoguchi, Izuru', 'Yoshimoto, Takayuki', 'Katagiri, Seiichiro', 'Mizuguchi, Junichiro', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Kimura, Yukihiko', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Mizoguchi I', 'Yoshimoto T', 'Katagiri S', 'Mizuguchi J', 'Tauchi T', 'Kimura Y', 'Inokuchi K', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K']","['Department of Immunoregulation, Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130709,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC7656535,,2013/06/14 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12216 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Sep;104(9):1146-53. doi: 10.1111/cas.12216.

The irreversible electrochemical reduction of the nitro groups of DNQX was characterized by the reduction peak potentials (Ep,7) of -0.43 V and -0.72 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 7.0, whereas NQX was reduced at Ep,7 = -0.67 V. The reactivities of DNQX and NQX towards the single-electron transferring enzymes NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase and NADPH:adrenodoxin reductase/adrenodoxin complex were similar to those of model nitrobenzenes with the single-electron reduction potential (E(1)(7)) values of -0.29 V - -0.42 V. DNQX and NQX also acted as substrates for two-electron transferring mammalian NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (DT-diaphorase). The cytotoxicity of DNQX in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) was prevented by antioxidants and an inhibitor of NQO1, dicoumarol, and was enhanced by the prooxidant alkylating agent 1,3-bis(2-chloromethyl)-1-nitrosourea. A comparison with model nitrobenzene compounds shows that the cytotoxicity of DNQX and NQX reasonably agrees with the ease of their electrochemical reduction, and/or their reactivities towards the used enzymatic single-electron reducing systems. Thus, our data imply that the cytotoxicity of DNQX in FLK cells is exerted mainly through oxidative stress.","['Sarlauskas, Jonas', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene, Ausra', 'Miseviciene, Lina', 'Krikstopaitis, Kastis', 'Anusevicius, Zilvinas', 'Cenas, Narimantas']","['Sarlauskas J', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene A', 'Miseviciene L', 'Krikstopaitis K', 'Anusevicius Z', 'Cenas N']","['Institute of Biochemistry of Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130613,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (6-nitrodihydroquinoxaline-2,3-dione)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '62T278S1MX (FG 9041)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Dicumarol/pharmacology', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/drug effects', 'Nitrobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Quinoxalines/*chemistry/pharmacology']",,,2013/06/13 06:00,2013/10/25 06:00,['2013/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['2013_458 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2013;60(2):227-31.

However, the importance of methylation patterns among the adolescent and young adult (AYA) ALL population has not been well established. DNA methylation of 18 candidate genes in 33 AYA ALL patients was analyzed at diagnosis and during treatment, to evaluate the frequency and clinical relevance of aberrant methylation in an AYA population treated on a uniform therapeutic regimen. Of 16 informative genes, there was a median of 6 methylated genes per AYA ALL patient. Correlations were identified between increasing number of methylated genes with male sex (P = 0.04), increased white blood cell (WBC) count (P = 0.04) and increased bone-marrow blast percentage (P = 0.04). Increasing age was associated with EPHA5 methylation (P = 0.05). Overall, patients experienced favorable outcomes with median survival that was not reached. On univariate analysis, methylation of CYP1B1 was associated with worse overall survival (HR 10.7, 95% CI 1.3-87.6, P = 0.03), disease-free survival (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-9.2, P = 0.04) and correlated with decreased CYP1B1 gene expression. A significant incidence of methylation within the AYA ALL population was identified, with increased methylation associated with distinct clinicopathologic features including male gender and elevated WBC count. Our results suggest aberrant methylation among AYA patients is frequent, and may provide a common pathogenic mechanism. The inferior outcome identified with methylation of the cytochrome p450 gene CYP1B1, an enzyme involved in drug metabolism and steroid synthesis, warrants further investigation.","['DiNardo, C D', 'Gharibyan, V', 'Yang, H', 'Wei, Y', 'Pierce, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Rytting, M']","['DiNardo CD', 'Gharibyan V', 'Yang H', 'Wei Y', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Rytting M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130723,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1B1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EPHA5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA5)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, EphA5/genetics/metabolism', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC3947930,['NIHMS549026'],2013/06/13 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23511 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Sep;88(9):784-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23511.

Monosomal karyotype (MK) is not a subgroup of IPSS-R. Additional prognostic information from MK in poor and very poor karyotype has been recently shown. The aim of our study was to determine the prognostic value of IPSS-R and MK for response and survival in AZA-treated high-risk MDS and AML with 20-30% of blasts patients. The study population included 154 patients who were classified according to IPSS-R. IPSS-R was not predictive of response (intermediate, 64%; poor, 44%; very poor, 56%; P = 0.28) or survival (intermediate, 25 months; poor, 12 months; very poor, 11 months; P = 0.14). Twenty-one patients (15%) presented with MK and had a median OS of 9 months. Patients with a very high IPSS-R score without MK had a median OS of 15 months, while patients with a high IPSS-R score without MK had a median OS of 13 months (P = 0.18). We reclassified patients into the following three groups to include MK status: very high (MK only; OS median: 9 months), high (very high IPSS-R without MK and high IPSS-R without MK; OS median: 14 months) and intermediate (OS median: 25 months). As in recent publication including MK prognostic, we confirmed that this classification was predictive for survival in AZA treated patients (P = 0.008). IPSS-R failed to discriminate between the prognostic subgroups.

They also appear equivalent to conventional induction chemotherapy in AML with >20% blasts and as conditioning regimens before allogeneic transplant (hematopoietic cell transplant, HCT) in MDS. Although azacitidine or decitabine are thus the standard to which newer therapies should be compared, here we discuss whether the improvement they afford in overall survival is sufficient to warrant a designation as a standard in treating individual patients. We also discuss pre- and post-treatment covariates, including assays of methylation to predict response, different schedules of administration, combinations with other active agents and use in settings other than active disease, in particular post HCT.

In our institution, seven patients of precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma without the central nervous involvement who had been treated by nelarabine to control their diseases received SCT from HLA-haploidentical familial donor (HLA-haploidentical SCT) with the conditioning regimen including high-dose cytarabine (HDAC). Three of evaluable six patients developed irreversible paresthesia and muscle weakness in both lower extremities after neutrophil engraftment. The results of nerve conduction studies and short latency somatosensory evoked potentials suggested axonal neuropathy of both lower extremities in all three patients and myelopathy in two patients. Negative findings of PET-CT, and analyses of repeated cerebrospinal fluid samples and the bone marrow also indicated that tumor involvement was improbable. In all three patients, the symptoms worsened or persisted despite administration of corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin. The high frequency of the neurological symptoms in our patients previously treated by nelarabine strongly suggested the association of the nelarabine use. Furthermore, the HLA-haploidentical SCT setting and the use of a potentially neurotoxic agent, HDAC might augment the neurotoxicity of nelarabine. It may be desirable that HLA-haploidentical SCT candidates avoid receiving nelarabine.","['Kawakami, Manabu', 'Taniguchi, Kyoko', 'Yoshihara, Satoshi', 'Ishii, Shinichi', 'Kaida, Katsuji', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Okada, Masaya', 'Watanabe, Shohei', 'Nishina, Takuya', 'Hamada, Hidefumi', 'Nakagawa, Masashi', 'Ogawa, Hiroyasu']","['Kawakami M', 'Taniguchi K', 'Yoshihara S', 'Ishii S', 'Kaida K', 'Ikegame K', 'Okada M', 'Watanabe S', 'Nishina T', 'Hamada H', 'Nakagawa M', 'Ogawa H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nissay Hospital, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130723,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Adult', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Lower Extremity/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Muscle Weakness/chemically induced/pathology/physiopathology', '*Paresthesia/chemically induced/pathology/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2013/06/13 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23502 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Oct;88(10):853-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23502.

Indeed, they generally induce faster and deeper molecular responses compared to imatinib that, however, is equally effective in at least 50% of patients. Moreover, some recent reports have questioned the long term safety of dasatinib and nilotinib. Therefore, upfront imatinib with early shift to second generation TKI for patients with slow/incomplete response might be as effective as front-line second generation TKI, with a possibly better safety profile. We retrospectively evaluated 91 chronic phase CML patients (median follow-up 57 months, median age 61 years), treated front-line with standard-dose imatinib and early therapy modifications (at 3-12 months) in case of unsatisfactory response or intolerance. Thirty-three patients (24 with unsatisfactory response, 9 intolerant) changed therapy, either by increasing imatinib dose (11/91) or by switching to second generation TKI (22 directly, 4 after high-dose imatinib). Globally, our strategy led to complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 98% of the patients, major molecular response (MMR) in 88% and molecular response 4 logs (MR(4.0) ) in 62%. Three patients in CCyR (3%), 2 of them in MMR too, suddenly progressed to blastic phase. At the last follow-up nine patients had died, seven of CML-unrelated causes and two only of CML progression. These results suggest that our strategy could be as effective as front line second generation TKI, with most of patients still receiving imatinib, a drug of better known long-term side effects and lower cost.","['Cerrano, Marco', 'Crisa, Elena', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Aguzzi, Chiara', 'Riccomagno, Paola', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Ferrero, Dario']","['Cerrano M', 'Crisa E', 'Pregno P', 'Aguzzi C', 'Riccomagno P', 'Boccadoro M', 'Ferrero D']","['Hematology Division, Universita degli Studi di Torino, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20130723,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,2013/06/13 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23501 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Oct;88(10):838-42. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23501.

A myeloproliferative disorder (NS/MPD), resembling juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), is occasionally diagnosed in infants with NS. In the present study, we performed a functional evaluation of the circulating hematopoietic progenitors in a series of NS, NS/MPD and JMML patients. The different functional patterns were compared with the aim to identify a possible NS subgroup worthy of stringent hematological follow-up for an increased risk of MPD development. We studied 27 NS and 5 JMML patients fulfilling EWOG-MDS criteria. The more frequent molecular defects observed in NS were mutations in the PTPN11 and SOS genes. The absolute count of monocytes, circulating CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, their apoptotic rate and the number of circulating CFU-GMs cultured in the presence of decreasing concentrations or in the absence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were evaluated. All JMML patients showed monocytosis>1,000/microl. Ten out of the 27 NS patients showed monocytosis>1,000/microl, which included the 3 NS/MPD patients. In JMML patients, circulating CD34+ cells were significantly increased (median, 109.8/microl; range, 44-232) with a low rate of apoptosis (median, 2.1%; range, 0.4-12.1%), and circulating CFU-GMs were hyper-responsive to GM-CSF. NS/MPD patients showed the same flow cytometric pattern as the JMML patients (median, CD34+ cells/microl, 205.7; range, 58-1374; median apoptotic rate, 1.4%; range, 0.2-2.4%) and their circulating CFU-GMs were hyper-responsive to GM-CSF. These functional alterations appeared 10 months before the typical clinical manifestations in 1 NS/MPD patient. In NS, the CD34+ absolute cell count and circulating CFU-GMs showed a normal pattern (median CD34+ cells/microl, 4.9; range, 1.3-17.5), whereas the CD34+ cell apoptotic rate was significantly decreased in comparison with the controls (median, 8.6%; range, 0-27.7% vs. median, 17.6%; range, 2.8-49.6%), suggesting an increased CD34+ cell survival. The functional evaluation of circulating hematopoietic progenitors showed specific patterns in NS and NS/MPD.

Although miR-133a has been shown to be important in osteogenesis, its roles in osteosarcoma carcinogenesis and progression remain unknown. Hence, we focused on the expression and mechanisms of miR-133a in osteosarcoma development in this study. We found that miR-133a was downregulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and primary human osteosarcoma tissues, and its decrease was significantly correlated with tumor progression and prognosis of the patients. Functional studies revealed that restoration of miR-133a could reduce cell proliferation, promote cell apoptosis, and suppress tumorigenicity in osteosarcoma cell lines. Furthermore, bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation were applied to identify target genes of miR-133a, and the results revealed that the anti-tumor effect of miR-133a was probably due to targeting and repressing of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression.

Yet, the International Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Workshops (IHIW) provide a collaborative platform to execute crucial large studies. In collaboration with 20 laboratories of the IHIW, the roles of 10 autosomal and 10 Y chromosome-encoded minor H antigens were investigated on GvHD and relapse incidence in 639 HLA-identical related donor (IRD) and 210 HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT recipients. Donor and recipient DNA samples were genotyped for the minor H antigens HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, HB-1, ACC-1, ACC-2, SP110, PANE1, UGT2B17, and HY. The correlations with the primary outcomes GvHD (acute or chronic GvHD), survival, and relapse were statistically analyzed. The results of these multicenter analyses show that none of the HLA class I-restricted HY antigens were found to be associated with any of the primary outcomes. Interestingly, of the HLA class II-restricted HY antigens analyzed, HLA-DQ5 positive recipients showed a significantly increased GvHD-free survival in female-to-male HSCT compared with male-to-female HSCT (P = .013). Yet, analysis of the overall gender effect, thus independent of the known HY antigens, between the gender groups demonstrated an increased GvHD incidence in the female-to-male transplantations (P < .005) and a decreased GvHD-free survival in the female-to-male transplantations (P < .001). Of all autosomally encoded minor H antigens, only mismatching for the broadly expressed minor H antigen HA-8 increased the GvHD incidence in IRD HSCT (Hazard ratio [HR] = 5.28, P < .005), but not in MUD HSCT. Most striking was the influence of hematopoietic restricted minor H antigens on GvL as mismatching for hematopoietic minor H antigens correlated with lower relapse rates (P = .078), higher relapse-free survival (P = .029), and higher overall survival (P = .032) in recipients with GvHD, but not in those without GvHD. In conclusion, the significant GvHD effect of the broadly expressed minor H antigen HA-8 favors matching for HA-8 in IRD, but not in MUD, patient/donor pairs. The GvHD-GvL association demonstrating a significant lower relapse in hematopoietic minor H antigen mismatched patient/donor pairs underlines their clinical applicability for adoptive immunotherapy, enhancing the GvL effect in a GvHD controllable manner.","['Spierings, Eric', 'Kim, Yeung-Hyen', 'Hendriks, Matthijs', 'Borst, Eric', 'Sergeant, Ruhena', 'Canossi, Angelica', 'Oudshoorn, Machteld', 'Loiseau, Pascale', 'Dolstra, Harry', 'Markiewicz, Miroslaw', 'Leffell, Mary S', 'Pereira, Noemi', 'Kircher, Brigitte', 'Turpeinen, Hannu', 'Eliaou, Jean-Francois', 'Gervais, Thibaut', 'Laurin, David', 'Enczmann, Jurgen', 'Martinetti, Miryam', 'Thomson, Jackie', 'Oguz, Fatma', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Partanen, Jukka', 'Siekiera, Urszula', 'Alessandrino, Emilio Paolo', 'Kalayoglu, Sevgi', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Spierings E', 'Kim YH', 'Hendriks M', 'Borst E', 'Sergeant R', 'Canossi A', 'Oudshoorn M', 'Loiseau P', 'Dolstra H', 'Markiewicz M', 'Leffell MS', 'Pereira N', 'Kircher B', 'Turpeinen H', 'Eliaou JF', 'Gervais T', 'Laurin D', 'Enczmann J', 'Martinetti M', 'Thomson J', 'Oguz F', 'Santarone S', 'Partanen J', 'Siekiera U', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Kalayoglu S', 'Brand R', 'Goulmy E']","['Laboratory for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. spierings@umcutrecht.nl']",['eng'],['CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130610,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Histocompatibility/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Unrelated Donors']",,,2013/06/13 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2013/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(13)00235-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Aug;19(8):1244-53. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.06.001.

We found that PHT displayed potent cytotoxicity in different tumor cell lines, showing IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase along with the augmented metaphase cells was found. Cells treated with PHT also showed typical hallmarks of apoptosis such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, phosphatidylserine exposure, increase of the caspase 3/7 and 8 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation without affecting membrane integrity. Studies conducted with isolated tubulin and docking models confirmed that PHT binds to the colchicine site and interferes in the polymerization of microtubules. These results demonstrated that PHT inhibits tubulin polymerization, arrests cancer cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and induces their apoptosis, exhibiting promising anticancer therapeutic potential.","['Magalhaes, Hemerson I F', 'Wilke, Diego V', 'Bezerra, Daniel P', 'Cavalcanti, Bruno C', 'Rotta, Rodrigo', 'de Lima, Denis P', 'Beatriz, Adilson', 'Moraes, Manoel O', 'Diniz-Filho, Jairo', 'Pessoa, Claudia']","['Magalhaes HI', 'Wilke DV', 'Bezerra DP', 'Cavalcanti BC', 'Rotta R', 'de Lima DP', 'Beatriz A', 'Moraes MO', 'Diniz-Filho J', 'Pessoa C']","['Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Departamento de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130610,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 ((4-methoxyphenyl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone)', '0 (Annexins)', '0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Benzophenones)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Annexins/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzophenones/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Models, Molecular', 'Polymerization', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Tubulin/*biosynthesis', '*Tubulin Modulators']",,,2013/06/13 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(13)00264-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2013 Oct 1;272(1):117-26. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.001.

Therefore, there is a need for novel targeted and less toxic therapies, particularly for patients who develop resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. Constitutively active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling characterizes many types of tumors, including AML, where it negatively influences response to therapeutic treatments. AREAS COVERED: The literature data showed that small inhibitor molecules targeting PI3K signaling induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and decreased drug-resistance in AML cells. PI3K inhibitors were also capable of targeting leukemic initiating cells (LICs), the most relevant target for leukemia eradication, whereas they tended to spare healthy hematopoietic stem cells. EXPERT OPINION: Data emerging from pre-clinical settings suggest that the PI3K pathway is critically involved in regulating proliferation, survival and drug-resistance of AML cells. Therefore, we propose that novel drugs targeting this signaling pathway may offer a novel and less toxic treatment option for AML patients, most likely in combination with a lower dosage of traditional chemotherapeutic agents or other innovative therapeutic agents.","['Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Bressanin, Daniela', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Soncin, Marina', 'Sparta, Antonino', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Evangelisti C', 'Evangelisti C', 'Bressanin D', 'Buontempo F', 'Chiarini F', 'Lonetti A', 'Soncin M', 'Sparta A', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council-Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy. camilla.evangelisti@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130611,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2013/06/13 06:00,2014/02/12 06:00,['2013/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2013.808333 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2013 Aug;17(8):921-36. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2013.808333.

METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing were used to sequence exon 4 of IDH gene in 570 AML patients from 2005 to 2011. RESULTS: In a cohort of 570 patients, AML IDH gene mutation was found in 90 (15.79%) patients. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were detected in 27 (4.74%) patients and 63 (11.05%) patients respectively. None of them had the combined mutations of IDH1 and IDH2. The highest frequency of IDH mutations was found in AML M1 (according to the FAB scheme) compared with all other subtypes (P < 0.01). The median age was 53 years in mutated group versus 40 years in wild-type group (P = 0.010). Mutated and wild-type groups had no significant difference in gender, white blood cell count at diagnosis, hemoglobin count and bone marrow blast percentage, excepting for blood platelets level (median 52x10(9)/L vs 31x10(9)/L, P < 0.01). IDH gene mutations were associated with cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML, NPM1 mutations and particularly with the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD. IDH gene mutations had no significant correlation with WT1, FLT3-TKD and MLL-PTD mutations. IDH mutated patients had a lower complete remission rate than unmutated in non-M3 patients (58.1% vs 77.9%, P < 0.05). And the patients with mutant IDH gene were associated with a shorter overall survival (28.4% vs 51.3%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: IDH gene mutations are more prevalent in elder AML patients and it may constitute a molecular marker for a poor prognosis in AML.","['Wang, Rong-xian', 'Wu, De-pei', 'Chen, Su-ning', 'He, Jun', 'Xu, Yang', 'Wang, Xiu-li', 'Yin, Jia', 'Tian, Hong', 'Tian, Xiao-peng', 'Sun, Ai-ning']","['Wang RX', 'Wu DP', 'Chen SN', 'He J', 'Xu Y', 'Wang XL', 'Yin J', 'Tian H', 'Tian XP', 'Sun AN']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

In addition, exogenous FasL was added to an in vitro culture system to investigate apoptotic changes in bovine oocytes, using annexin-V and terminal uridine nick-end labeling staining, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In this study, Fas was expressed in immature oocytes, whereas FasL was expressed in cumulus cells, but not in immature oocytes; annexin-V- and terminal uridine nick-end labeling-positive rates of oocytes treated with 2, 10, or 50 ng/mL FasL were higher than those of control oocytes (P < 0.05); and oocytes from the three treatment groups had higher expression levels of Fas and B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 associated X than those in the control group (P < 0.05).

Standard treatment consists of surgery in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy regimens. The development and approval of imatinib for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and the fully human monoclonal antibody, anti-GD2, as part of an immune therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma patients have established the precedent for use of targeted inhibitors along with standard chemotherapy backbones. However, few targeted agents tested have achieved traditional clinical endpoints for osteosarcoma. Many biological agents demonstrating anti-tumor responses in preclinical and early-phase clinical testing have failed to reach response thresholds to justify randomized trials with large numbers of patients. The development of targeted therapies for pediatric cancer remains a significant challenge. To aid in the prioritization of new agents for clinical testing, the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) has developed reliable and robust preclinical pediatric cancer models to rapidly screen agents for activity in multiple childhood cancers and establish pharmacological parameters and effective drug concentrations for clinical trials. In this article, we examine a range of standard and novel agents that have been evaluated by the PPTP, and we discuss the preclinical and clinical development of these for the treatment of osteosarcoma. We further demonstrate that committed resources for hypothesis-driven drug discovery and development are needed to yield clinical successes in the search for new therapies for this pediatric disease.","['Sampson, Valerie B', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Kamara, Davida', 'Anders Kolb, E']","['Sampson VB', 'Gorlick R', 'Kamara D', 'Anders Kolb E']","['Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children , Wilmington, DE , USA.']",['eng'],['P20 GM103464/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20130531,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC3668267,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/06/12 06:01,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00132 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 May 31;3:132. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00132. eCollection 2013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['complete response', 'event-free survival', 'maintained complete response', 'osteosarcoma', 'partial response', 'pediatric preclinical testing program', 'progressive disease', 'progressive disease with growth delay']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we reported a clinical-grade, cytokine-based culture method for the generation of NK cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells with high yield, purity and in vitro functionality. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vivo anti-leukemic potential of UCB-NK cells generated with our GMP-compliant culture system in terms of biodistribution, survival and cytolytic activity following adoptive transfer in immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL2Rg(null) mice. Using single photon emission computed tomography, we first demonstrated active migration of UCB-NK cells to bone marrow, spleen and liver within 24 h after infusion. Analysis of the chemokine receptor expression profile of UCB-NK cells matched in vivo findings. Particularly, a firm proportion of UCB-NK cells functionally expressed CXCR4, what could trigger BM homing in response to its ligand CXCL12. In addition, high expression of CXCR3 and CCR6 supported the capacity of UCB-NK cells to migrate to inflamed tissues via the CXCR3/CXCL10-11 and CCR6/CCL20 axis. Thereafter, we showed that low dose IL-15 mediates efficient survival, expansion and maturation of UCB-NK cells in vivo. Most importantly, we demonstrate that a single UCB-NK cell infusion combined with supportive IL-15 administration efficiently inhibited growth of human leukemia cells implanted in the femur of mice, resulting in significant prolongation of mice survival. These preclinical studies strongly support the therapeutic potential of ex vivo-generated UCB-NK cells in the treatment of myeloid leukemia after immunosuppressive chemotherapy.","['Cany, Jeannette', 'van der Waart, Anniek B', 'Tordoir, Marleen', 'Franssen, Gerben M', 'Hangalapura, Basav N', 'de Vries, Jolanda', 'Boerman, Otto', 'Schaap, Nicolaas', 'van der Voort, Robbert', 'Spanholtz, Jan', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['Cany J', 'van der Waart AB', 'Tordoir M', 'Franssen GM', 'Hangalapura BN', 'de Vries J', 'Boerman O', 'Schaap N', 'van der Voort R', 'Spanholtz J', 'Dolstra H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre-RUNMC, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130605,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Tracking', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/deficiency/genetics', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Organ Specificity', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",PMC3673996,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0064384 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-06916 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 5;8(6):e64384. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064384.

It has been shown recently that WRD5 and Dpy-30, specific components of the SET1/MLL protein complexes, play important roles during ESC self-renewal and differentiation of neural lineages. However, not much is known about how and where specific trithorax complexes are targeted to genes involved in self-renewal or lineage-specification. Here, we report that the recruitment of the hSET1A histone H3K4 methyltransferase (HMT) complex by transcription factor USF1 is required for mesoderm specification and lineage differentiation. In undifferentiated ESCs, USF1 maintains hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HS/PC) associated bivalent chromatin domains and differentiation potential. Furthermore, USF1 directed recruitment of the hSET1A complex to the HoxB4 promoter governs the transcriptional activation of HoxB4 gene and regulates the formation of early hematopoietic cell populations. Disruption of USF or hSET1A function by overexpression of a dominant-negative AUSF1 mutant or by RNA-interference-mediated knockdown, respectively, led to reduced expression of mesoderm markers and inhibition of lineage differentiation. We show that USF1 and hSET1A together regulate H3K4me3 modifications and transcription preinitiation complex assembly at the hematopoietic-associated HoxB4 gene during differentiation. Finally, ectopic expression of USF1 in ESCs promotes mesoderm differentiation and enforces the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition by inducing hematopoietic-associated transcription factors, HoxB4 and TAL1. Taken together, our findings reveal that the guided-recruitment of the hSET1A histone methyltransferase complex and its H3K4 methyltransferase activity by transcription regulator USF1 safeguards hematopoietic transcription programs and enhances mesoderm/hematopoietic differentiation.","['Deng, Changwang', 'Li, Ying', 'Liang, Shermi', 'Cui, Kairong', 'Salz, Tal', 'Yang, Hui', 'Tang, Zhanyun', 'Gallagher, Patrick G', 'Qiu, Yi', 'Roeder, Robert', 'Zhao, Keji', 'Bungert, Jorg', 'Huang, Suming']","['Deng C', 'Li Y', 'Liang S', 'Cui K', 'Salz T', 'Yang H', 'Tang Z', 'Gallagher PG', 'Qiu Y', 'Roeder R', 'Zhao K', 'Bungert J', 'Huang S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL106184/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK071900/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL095674/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129325/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL091929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL090589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129325/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52356/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL095674/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL090589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK071900/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL091929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL091929-01A1S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052356/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (USF1 protein, human)', '0 (Upstream Stimulatory Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Setd1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mesoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Upstream Stimulatory Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3675019,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1003524 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-12-02454 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2013 Jun;9(6):e1003524. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003524.

Overexpression of the cell-surface chemokine receptor CXCR4 is associated with poor outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Certain nonchemotherapeutic agents have been shown to modulate CXCR4 expression and alter leukemia interactions with stromal cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. Because chemotherapy is the mainstay of AML treatment, it was hypothesized that standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents induce dynamic changes in leukemia surface CXCR4 expression, and that chemotherapy-induced upregulation of CXCR4 represents a mechanism of acquired therapeutic resistance. Here, it was shown that cell lines variably upregulate CXCR4 with chemotherapy treatment. Those that showed upregulation were differentially protected from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis when cocultured with stroma. The functional effects of chemotherapy-induced CXCR4 upregulation in an AML cell line (MOLM-14, which harbors consistent upregulated CXCR4) and clinical specimens were explored. Importantly, enhanced stromal-cell derived factor-1alpha (SDF1A/CXCL12)-mediated chemotaxis and stromal protection from additional chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was found. Furthermore, treatment with plerixafor, a CXCR4 inhibitor, preferentially decreased stromal protection with higher chemotherapy-induced upregulation of surface CXCR4. Thus, increased chemokine receptor CXCR4 expression after treatment with conventional chemotherapy may represent a mechanism of therapeutic resistance in pediatric AML. IMPLICATIONS: CXCR4 may be a biomarker for the stratification and optimal treatment of patients using CXCR4 inhibitors.","['Sison, Edward Allan R', 'McIntyre, Emily', 'Magoon, Daniel', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Sison EA', 'McIntyre E', 'Magoon D', 'Brown P']","['Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, The Bunting Blaustein Cancer Research Building, 1650 Orleans Street, Room 2M46, Baltimore, MD 21287. esison1@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA60441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130610,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzylamines', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects/genetics', 'Child', 'Cyclams', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3778118,['NIHMS491379'],2013/06/12 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-13-0114 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0114 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2013 Sep;11(9):1004-16. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0114.

We investigated this association by pooling individual-level data from 12 case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Two measures of fetal growth-weight-for-gestational-age and proportion of optimal birth weight (POBW)-were analysed. Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and combined in fixed effects meta-analyses. Pooled analyses of all data were also undertaken using multivariable logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were undertaken when possible. Data on weight for gestational age were available for 7,348 cases and 12,489 controls from all 12 studies and POBW data were available for 1,680 cases and 3,139 controls from three studies. The summary ORs from the meta-analyses were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.36) for children who were large for gestational age relative to appropriate for gestational age, and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.24) for a one-standard deviation increase in POBW. The pooled analyses produced similar results. The summary and pooled ORs for small-for-gestational-age children were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.92) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.95), respectively. Results were consistent across subgroups defined by sex, ethnicity and immunophenotype, and when the analysis was restricted to children who did not have high birth weight. The evidence that accelerated fetal growth is associated with a modest increased risk of childhood ALL is strong and consistent with known biological mechanisms involving insulin-like growth factors.

We focused on Anxa1 because it is one of the major proteins upregulated in imatinib-sensitive KCL22S cells versus imatinib-resistant KCL22R. Our proteomic strategy revealed 21 interactors. Bioinformatic analysis showed that most of these proteins are involved in cell death processes. Among the proteins identified, we studied the interaction of Anxa1 with two phosphatases, Shp1 and Shp2, which were recently identified as biomarkers of imatinib sensitivity in patients affected by chronic myeloid leukemia. Our data open new perspectives in the search for annexin-mediated signaling pathways and may shed light on mechanisms of resistance to imatinib that are unrelated to Bcr-Abl activity.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify trends in the use of CT in pediatrics and the associated radiation exposure and cancer risk. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Seven US health care systems. PARTICIPANTS: The use of CT was evaluated for children younger than 15 years of age from 1996 to 2010, including 4 857 736 child-years of observation. Radiation doses were calculated for 744 CT scans performed between 2001 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of CT use, organ and effective doses, and projected lifetime attributable risks of cancer. RESULTS The use of CT doubled for children younger than 5 years of age and tripled for children 5 to 14 years of age between 1996 and 2005, remained stable between 2006 and 2007, and then began to decline. Effective doses varied from 0.03 to 69.2 mSv per scan. An effective dose of 20 mSv or higher was delivered by 14% to 25% of abdomen/pelvis scans, 6% to 14% of spine scans, and 3% to 8% of chest scans. Projected lifetime attributable risks of solid cancer were higher for younger patients and girls than for older patients and boys, and they were also higher for patients who underwent CT scans of the abdomen/pelvis or spine than for patients who underwent other types of CT scans. For girls, a radiation-induced solid cancer is projected to result from every 300 to 390 abdomen/pelvis scans, 330 to 480 chest scans, and 270 to 800 spine scans, depending on age. The risk of leukemia was highest from head scans for children younger than 5 years of age at a rate of 1.9 cases per 10 000 CT scans. Nationally, 4 million pediatric CT scans of the head, abdomen/pelvis, chest, or spine performed each year are projected to cause 4870 future cancers. Reducing the highest 25% of doses to the median might prevent 43% of these cancers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The increased use of CT in pediatrics, combined with the wide variability in radiation doses, has resulted in many children receiving a high-dose examination. Dose-reduction strategies targeted to the highest quartile of doses could dramatically reduce the number of radiation-induced cancers.","['Miglioretti, Diana L', 'Johnson, Eric', 'Williams, Andrew', 'Greenlee, Robert T', 'Weinmann, Sheila', 'Solberg, Leif I', 'Feigelson, Heather Spencer', 'Roblin, Douglas', 'Flynn, Michael J', 'Vanneman, Nicholas', 'Smith-Bindman, Rebecca']","['Miglioretti DL', 'Johnson E', 'Williams A', 'Greenlee RT', 'Weinmann S', 'Solberg LI', 'Feigelson HS', 'Roblin D', 'Flynn MJ', 'Vanneman N', 'Smith-Bindman R']","['Group Health Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. dmiglioretti@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['R21 CA131698/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24CA125036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA079689/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA131698/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19CA79689/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 CA125036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,JAMA Pediatr,JAMA pediatrics,101589544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects']",PMC3936795,['NIHMS548644'],2013/06/12 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1696279 [pii]', '10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.311 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Pediatr. 2013 Aug 1;167(8):700-7. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.311.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['JAMA Pediatr. 2013 Aug 1;167(8):693-5.

Depending on extent of disease, treatment consisted of six to eight rituximab infusions and four to six courses of intensive chemotherapy (attenuated in patients aged >55 years) with high-dose methotrexate, fractionated ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide, other drugs in rotation, and intrathecal chemoprophylaxis. One-hundred five patients were treated (median age 47 years, range 17-78 years); 48% had Burkitt leukemia, 25% were older than 60 years, 37% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score >1, and 14% were positive for human immunodeficiency virus. The complete response rate and 3-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 79%, 67% and 75%, respectively, ranging from 100% to 45% for survival (P=0.000) and from 100% to 60% for disease-free survival (P=0.01) in patients with low, intermediate and high adapted International Prognostic Index scores. In multivariate analysis, only age (</= versus >60 years) and performance status (0-1 versus >1) retained prognostic significance, identifying three risk groups with overall and disease-free survival probabilities of 88% and 87.5%, 57% and 70.5%, 20% and 28.5% (P=0.0000 and P=0.0001), respectively. The relapse rate was only 7% in patients treated with an intercycle interval </= 25 days. This regimen achieved 100% curability in patients with low adapted International Prognostic Index scores (21% of total), and very close to 90% in patients aged </= 60 years with performance score 0-1 (48% of total).

Twelve patients were treated according to the INTERFANT-06 protocol and received up to 10,000 U/m(2) recombinant asparaginase as intravenous infusions on days 15, 18, 22, 25, 29 and 33 of remission induction treatment. The asparaginase dose was individually adjusted by protocol to 67% of the calculated dose for infants <6 months, and to 75% of the calculated dose for infants aged 6-12 months. The trough serum asparaginase activities observed were above 20, 50, and 100 U/L in 86%, 71%, and 51% of measured samples, respectively. Looking only at the data assessed 3 days after asparaginase infusion these percentages were 91%, 84%, and 74%, respectively. Asparagine was completely depleted in serum in all but one patient who was the youngest in the study. No anti-asparaginase antibodies were detected during this treatment phase. Observed adverse reactions are known to be possible and are labeled side effects of asparaginase treatment and chemotherapy. We conclude that the asparaginase dose regimen used in infants is safe and provides complete asparagine depletion for the desired time period in nearly all patients. Measured asparaginase trough serum levels justify the higher doses used in infants compared to in older children and show that 3-day intervals are preferred over 4-day intervals.

Polo-like kinase 1 protein and Thr210 phosphorylation levels were higher in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=172) than in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (n=10) (P<0.0001). High Polo-like kinase 1 protein phosphorylation, but not expression, was associated with a lower probability of event-free survival (P=0.042) and was a borderline significant prognostic factor (P=0.065) in a multivariate analysis including age and initial white blood cell count. Polo-like kinase 1 was necessary for leukemic cell survival, since short hairpin-mediated Polo-like kinase 1 knockdown in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines inhibited cell proliferation by G2/M cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis through caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Primary patient cells with a high Polo-like kinase 1 protein expression were sensitive to the Polo-like kinase 1-specific inhibitor NMS-P937 in vitro, whereas cells with a low expression and normal bone marrow cells were resistant. This sensitivity was likely not caused by Polo-like kinase 1 mutations, since only one new mutation (Ser335Arg) was found by 454-sequencing of 38 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. This mutation did not affect Polo-like kinase 1 expression or NMS-P937 sensitivity.

PIM-2 is highly expressed in neoplastic tissues and in leukemic and lymphoma cell lines, which is consistent with its role during oncogenic transformation. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway appears to be deregulated in a variety of tumors, with sustained activity of NF-kappaB leading to apoptotic resistance in tumor cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether expression of PIM-2 and NF-kappaB is altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-three patients were included: 91 with AML and 52 with ALL, aged 18-84 (median 46.7). Eighty-three patients (51 AML and 32 ALL) reached complete remission (CR). Bone marrow samples were collected at the time of diagnosis. Control samples were obtained from 24 healthy donors. We analyzed PIM-2 and NF-kappaB expression by RQ-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Expression of both PIM-2 and NF-kappaB in all leukemia patients and subgroups was significantly higher than in controls. AML patients who reached CR expressed PIM-2 and NF-kappaB at significantly lower levels than did patients with primary resistance to chemotherapy and who did not reach CR (NCR). Survival analysis revealed that in AML patients with higher expression of PIM-2 the overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter than in patients with lower expression. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that PIM-2 and NF-kappaB gene expression is increased in patients with AML and ALL. Moreover, high PIM-2 expression is associated with CR rate and OS in AML patients.","['Kapelko-Slowik, Katarzyna', 'Urbaniak-Kujda, Donata', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Jazwiec, Bozena', 'Dybko, Jaroslaw', 'Jakubaszko, Jacek', 'Slowik, Miroslaw', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']","['Kapelko-Slowik K', 'Urbaniak-Kujda D', 'Wolowiec D', 'Jazwiec B', 'Dybko J', 'Jakubaszko J', 'Slowik M', 'Kuliczkowski K']","['Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland. kks9999@wp.pl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130607,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/09/12 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1052449 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1052449 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2013 Jun 7;67:553-9. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1052449.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They share the same environment, and thus are exposed to the same environmental factors such as air pollution, tobacco smoke, and various chemicals. Recent development of veterinary care has led to a significant extension of dogs' lifespan and allowed the diagnosis and treatment of a growing number of different diseases in this species. Among all diseases in dogs, cancer is considered the main cause of mortality, with lymphoproliferative disorders accounting for up to 30% of all canine cancers. Some of them, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and lymphocytic leukemia, are very similar in the etiology, pathogenesis and response to treatment to the diseases occurring in humans. Due to anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, the dog is a useful model for the study of new therapeutic strategies for humans. Studies on the canine neoplasia are currently limited by the lack of well-characterized and widely available cell lines; thus, recently obtained canine NHL cell lines may become a valuable model for such studies. Investigation of their sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of different factors should allow the creation of a database similar to the existing classification of human leukemias and lymphomas. This should enable quick and accurate diagnosis and selection of appropriate treatment based on phenotypic analysis and histopathological examination of clinical samples. The cooperation between human and veterinary oncologists gives the opportunity to use the dog as a model for the study of certain types of cancers presenting a challenge for modern medicine.","['Pawlak, Aleksandra', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz, Bozena', 'Rapak, Andrzej']","['Pawlak A', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz B', 'Rapak A']","['Zaklad Farmakologii i Toksykologii, Wydzial Medycyny Weterynaryjnej, Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wroclawiu, Wroclaw.']",['pol'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130522,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,,IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/veterinary', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*veterinary']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/09/12 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1050411 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1050411 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2013 May 22;67:471-80. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1050411.,,,,,Pies jako model do badan porownawczychnad ludzkimi chloniakami i bialaczkami.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the anticancer activity of the fucoidan extracted from the brown seaweed Undaria pinnatifida was investigated in human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells, and the underlying mechanisms of action were investigated. SMMC-7721 cells exposed to fucoidan displayed growth inhibition and several typical features of apoptotic cells, such as chromatin condensation and marginalization, a decrease in the number of mitochondria, and in mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation. Fucoidan-induced cell death was associated with depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), accumulation of high intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and accompanied by damage to the mitochondrial ultrastructure, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, Deltapsim) and caspase activation. Moreover, fucoidan led to altered expression of factors related to apoptosis, including downregulating Livin and XIAP mRNA, which are members of the inhibitor of apoptotic protein (IAP) family, and increased the Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio. These findings suggest that fucoidan isolated from U. pinnatifida induced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells via the ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway.","['Yang, Lili', 'Wang, Peisheng', 'Wang, Huaxin', 'Li, Qiaomei', 'Teng, Hongming', 'Liu, Zhichao', 'Yang, Wenbo', 'Hou, Lin', 'Zou, Xiangyang']","['Yang L', 'Wang P', 'Wang H', 'Li Q', 'Teng H', 'Liu Z', 'Yang W', 'Hou L', 'Zou X']","['Department of Biotechnology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130610,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC7 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Glutathione/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polysaccharides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Undaria/*chemistry', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics']",PMC3721216,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['md11061961 [pii]', '10.3390/md11061961 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2013 Jun 10;11(6):1961-76. doi: 10.3390/md11061961.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients respond well to imatinib mesylate, raising the question as to whether patients with a PDGF receptor mutation in other tumor types should receive a tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. We characterized 10 novel somatic point mutations in PDGFRA that have been reported in isolated cases of glioblastoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, peripheral nerve sheath tumors and neuroendocrine carcinoma. The PDGFRA transmembrane domain mutation V536E stimulated Ba/F3 cell growth and signaling via ERK and STAT5 in the absence of ligand. This mutant, identified in glioblastoma, was strongly inhibited by imatinib. Modeling suggested that the mutation modulates the packing of the transmembrane domain helices in the receptor dimer. By contrast, two mutations in highly conserved residues affected the receptor traffic to the cell surface or kinase activity, thereby preventing the response to PDGF. The other mutations had no significant impact on the receptor activity. This functional analysis matched the predictions of SIFT and PolyPhen for only five mutations and these algorithms do not discriminate gain from loss of function. Finally, an E996K variant that had been identified in a melanoma cell line was not expressed in these cells. Altogether, several newly identified PDGFRA mutations do not activate the receptor and may therefore represent passenger mutations. Our results also underline the importance of characterizing novel kinase alterations in cancer patients.","['Velghe, A I', 'Van Cauwenberghe, S', 'Polyansky, A A', 'Chand, D', 'Montano-Almendras, C P', 'Charni, S', 'Hallberg, B', 'Essaghir, A', 'Demoulin, J-B']","['Velghe AI', 'Van Cauwenberghe S', 'Polyansky AA', 'Chand D', 'Montano-Almendras CP', 'Charni S', 'Hallberg B', 'Essaghir A', 'Demoulin JB']","['de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', '1] Department of Structural and Computational Biology, Max F Perutz Laboratories, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria [2] MM Shemyakin and Yu A Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130610,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/chemistry/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/07/20 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013218 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.218 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 May 15;33(20):2568-76. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.218.

XPO1 encodes CRM1, a nuclear export protein. XPO1 expression increases with MM disease progression. Patients with MM have a higher expression of XPO1 compared with normal plasma cells (P<0.04) and to patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance/smoldering MM (P<0.0001). The highest XPO1 level was found in human MM cell lines (HMCLs). A selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound KPT-276 specifically and irreversibly inhibits the nuclear export function of XPO1. The viability of 12 HMCLs treated with KTP-276 was significantly reduced. KPT-276 also actively induced apoptosis in primary MM patient samples. In gene expression analyses, two genes of probable relevance were dysregulated by KPT-276: cell division cycle 25 homolog A (CDC25A) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), both of which are associated with c-MYC pathway.

A total of 152 patients received either a RIC allo-SCT using a 9/10 mismatched unrelated donor (MisMUD, n=42) or a double unrelated umbilical cord blood (dUCB, n=110) graft. With a median follow-up of 30.3 months, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 26% in the dUCB group versus 24% in the MisMUD group (P=0.95). Grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence was 19.7% in the dUCB group versus 21.4% in the MisMUD group (P=0.83). The cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GVHD at 2 years was 6.4% in the dUCB group versus 21.4% in the MisMUD group (P=0.02). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival at 2 years was comparable between both groups (52.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 42.1-61.5%) in the dUCB group versus 47.9% (95% CI, 31.6-62.4%) in the MisMUD group, P=0.55). Progression-free survival at 2 years was 43.3% (95% CI, 33.7-52.5%) in the dUCB group versus 38.3% (95% CI, 23.2-53.3%) in the MisMUD group (P=0.55).

A new prognostic score including only two variables, spleen size and basophils, was developed for the prediction of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and progression-free survival (PFS). The score was based on a large series of patients who were enrolled in prospective multicenter studies of first-line imatinib treatment. The prognostic value of the EUTOS (European Treatment and Outcome Study for CML) score has now been tested in an independent, multicenter, multinational series of 1288 patients who were treated first-line with imatinib outside prospective studies. It was found that also in these patients, the EUTOS prognostic score was predictive for CCyR, PFS and overall survival (OS). In addition, the prognostic value of the score was reported to be significant in seven of the eight other independent studies of almost 2000 patients that were performed in Europe, the Americas and Asia.

Although it has been a target of drug and vaccine design, there are not any polyclonal antibody tools to specifically probe the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the pocket region. Our goal was to elicit a neutralizing polyclonal antibody that targets this pocket region. A conserved peptide designated R73 that is derived from the pocket region of TM of ALV-J was synthesized. New Zealand rabbits were immunized with R73 conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and the antiserum was gained 10 days after the third immunity boost. The antibody titers were tested by endpoint ELISA, and the specificity and affinity were tested by Western blot analysis. The results showed that R73 has good antigenicity (antibody titers approximately 1:64,000 approximately 1:128,000), immunogenicity, and affinity. The results of the indirect fluorescent assay (IFA) and real-time RT-PCR test showed that R73 polyclonal antibody can recognize ALV-J antigen and completely inhibit viral replication in DF-1 cells. The results of the neutralization assay showed that neutralization titer of the antiserum was 1:16.

As critical effectors of antiviral immune response, dendritic cells (DCs) are implicated to play an important role in determining the outcome of HTLV-1 infection. However, a complete understanding of their role in any disease pathogenesis requires extensive assessment of the phenotypic and functional state of DCs. To enable this, we developed a polychromatic antibody cocktail comprising key phenotypic and functional markers of DCs and applied it in a patient cohort from the HTLV-1 endemic region, Jamaica, consisted of seronegative controls, asymptomatic carriers (ACs), ATL, and HAM/TSP patients. This ex vivo analyses included two major subsets of blood DCs, myeloid and plasmacytoid (mDCs and pDCs, respectively). The comparative analyses of results demonstrated a decreased pDC frequency in both ATL and HAM/TSP patients as compared to ACs and seronegative controls. Similarly, CD86 expression on both mDCs and pDCs was significantly higher in HAM/TSP (but not ATL) patients compared to ACs. Interestingly, HLA-DR expression was significantly lower on pDCs of patients as compared to carriers; however, for mDCs, only the HAM/TSP group had significantly lower expression of HLA-DR. Unlike HAM/TSP individuals, ATL individuals had higher HLA-ABC expression on mDCs compared to ACs. Finally, both mDCs and pDCs of HAM/TSP patients had significantly higher expression of the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) compared to ACs. Overall, this study suggests that DCs exhibit a differential phenotypic and functional profile between patients (ATL and HAM/TSP) and carriers of HTLV-1 and could provide an important tool for understanding HTLV-1 immunopathogenesis during infection and disease.","['Manuel, Sharron L', 'Sehgal, Mohit', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Goedert, James J', 'Betts, Michael R', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Manuel SL', 'Sehgal M', 'Khan ZK', 'Goedert JJ', 'Betts MR', 'Jain P']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI077414/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 MH079785/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI 093172-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130719,United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'B7-2 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'B7-H1 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Carrier State/*virology', 'Cell Adhesion/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-B Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-C Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*genetics/immunology/virology']",PMC3749709,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/01/21 06:00,['2013/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/aid.2013.0054 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2013 Sep;29(9):1273-85. doi: 10.1089/aid.2013.0054.

Here we demonstrate that miR-26a is down-regulated in breast cancer cells and clinical specimens and its modulation in breast cancer cells regulates cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and apoptosis. MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as novel targets of miR-26a was found to be in reverse correlation with ectopic expression of miR-26a and knockdown of MCL-1 phenocopied the effect of miR-26a in breast cancer cell lines. It was further explored that miR-26a increased sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel in which MCL-1 was involved. Thus, miR-26a impacts on cell proliferation and migration of breast cancer by regulating several carcinogenesis-related processes, including a novel mechanism involving the targeting of MCL-1.","['Gao, Jie', 'Li, Laisheng', 'Wu, Minqing', 'Liu, Min', 'Xie, Xinhua', 'Guo, Jiaoli', 'Tang, Hailin', 'Xie, Xiaoming']","['Gao J', 'Li L', 'Wu M', 'Liu M', 'Xie X', 'Guo J', 'Tang H', 'Xie X']","['Department of Breast Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130604,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN26A microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology']",PMC3672200,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0065138 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-38462 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 4;8(6):e65138. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0065138.

High levels of miR-155 have been detected in human neoplasms, and overexpression of miR-155 has been found to induce lymphoma in mice. High levels of miR-155 were detected in CLL cells and STAT3, which is known to induce miR-21 and miR-181b-1 expression, is constitutively activated in CLL. Given these findings, we hypothesized that STAT3 induces miR-155. Sequence analysis revealed that the miR-155 promoter harbors two putative STAT3 binding sites. Therefore, truncated miR-155 promoter constructs and STAT3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) were co-transfected into MM1 cells. Of the two putative binding sites, STAT3-siRNA reduced the luciferase activity of the construct containing the 700-709 bp STAT3 binding site, suggesting that this site is involved in STAT3-induced transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that STAT3 bound to the miR-155 promoter in CLL cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assay confirmed that STAT3 bound to the 700-709 bp but not the 615-624 bp putative STAT3 binding site in CLL cells. Finally, STAT3-small hairpin RNA downregulated miR-155 gene expression, suggesting that constitutively activated STAT3 binds to the miR-155 gene promoter.

The number of surface-exposed receptors is a dynamic balance of de novo synthesis, transport to the plasma membrane, internalization, recycling, degradation and ectodomain shedding. We previously reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein 41 (RNF41) inhibits basal lysosomal degradation and enhances ectodomain shedding of JAK2-associated cytokine receptors. Ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), an RNF41-interacting deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) stabilizes RNF41 and is involved in trafficking of various transmembrane proteins. The present study identifies USP8 as a substrate of RNF41 and reveals that loss of USP8 explains the aforementioned RNF41 effects. RNF41 redistributes and ubiquitylates USP8, and reduces USP8 levels. In addition, USP8 knockdown functionally matches the effects of RNF41 ectopic expression on the model leptin and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptors. Moreover, RNF41 indirectly destabilizes the ESCRT-0 complex through suppression of USP8. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that RNF41 controls JAK2-associated cytokine receptor trafficking by acting as a key regulator of USP8 and ESCRT-0 stability. Balanced reciprocal cross-regulation of RNF41 and USP8 thus determines whether receptors are sorted for lysosomal degradation or recycling, this way regulating basal cytokine receptor levels.","['De Ceuninck, Leentje', 'Wauman, Joris', 'Masschaele, Delphine', 'Peelman, Frank', 'Tavernier, Jan']","['De Ceuninck L', 'Wauman J', 'Masschaele D', 'Peelman F', 'Tavernier J']","['Department of Medical Protein Research, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), Albert Baertsoenkaai 3, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130607,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF41 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Cell Movement/physiology', 'Endopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/06/16 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.131250 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.131250 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2013 Aug 15;126(Pt 16):3770-81. doi: 10.1242/jcs.131250.

The most common site of extramedullary relapse is the central nervous system (CNS), and the majority of CNS relapses occur in patients with high-risk disease in which white blood cell count at presentation is greater than 10x10(3)/muL. The best management of such patients is still controversial. We describe a 47-year-old man with APL who developed two CNS relapses which were diagnosed through the presence of t(15;17)(q22;q21) on PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), despite presenting initially with intermediate-risk disease. We conclude that the intermediate risk group is very heterogeneous and these patients sometimes may behave like high-risk patients. Also, clinicians should take into account symptoms that can be related to CNS relapse in patients with APL and consider lumbar puncture even if radiological imaging does not reveal anything.","['Sahin, Deniz Goren', 'Gunduz, Eren', 'Akay, Olga Meltem', 'Gulbas, Zafer']","['Sahin DG', 'Gunduz E', 'Akay OM', 'Gulbas Z']","['Department of Hematology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey. drdenizgoren@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130606,England,BMJ Case Rep,BMJ case reports,101526291,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC3702910,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcr-2013-009456 [pii]', '10.1136/bcr-2013-009456 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Case Rep. 2013 Jun 6;2013. pii: bcr-2013-009456. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2013-009456.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this knowledge comes concern for late effects of therapy, especially the risk of secondary malignancy. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with AML or ALL between the ages of 0 and 18 years who survived at least 5 years after diagnosis were included in analysis. Cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancy at 30 years was calculated. To compare incidence of subsequent malignancies with rates of the US population, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated. RESULTS: Four thousand eight hundred six patients were included in the analysis. Median follow-up was 14.5 years (range 5.0-35.9 years). A total of 82 patients developed a second malignancy. The most common second tumor was brain (24 %) followed by thyroid (22 %). Cumulative incidences of secondary malignancy at 30 years for ALL patients and AML patients were 3.9 and 4.3 %, respectively (p = 0.10). Patients were at an increased risk of malignancy compared to the US population (SIR = 3.9, 95 % CI = 3.2-4.8). The SIR for all malignancies for patients diagnosed between 1973 and 1979, 1980 and 1989, and 1990 and 1999 were 2.1 (95 % CI = 1.3-3.4), 4.3 (95 % CI = 3.1-5.9), and 4.4 (95 % CI = 2.7-6.6), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although incidence of secondary malignancy at 30 years in survivors of childhood leukemia is low, the rate exceeds the expected rate of malignancy for a cohort of this age by nearly 4:1. The development of a subsequent malignancy has significant impact on overall-survival and continued research is needed to assess the long-term risk of subsequent malignancy with modern therapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Although survivors of childhood leukemia experience an increased rate of malignancy compared to their peers, the development of a subsequent malignancy is still a rare event. However, continued long-term follow-up is warranted.","['Perkins, Stephanie M', 'Dewees, Todd', 'Shinohara, Eric T', 'Reddy, Mythri M', 'Frangoul, Haydar']","['Perkins SM', 'Dewees T', 'Shinohara ET', 'Reddy MM', 'Frangoul H']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 4921 Parkview Place, CAM LL, Saint Louis, MO, 63108, USA, sperkins@radonc.wustl.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130609,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/07/19 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-013-0292-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2013 Dec;7(4):544-50. doi: 10.1007/s11764-013-0292-8.

Salvage options were retrospectively classified as follows: best supportive care (BSC), low-dose cytarabine (LDAC), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), intensive chemotherapy (ICT), or ICT combined with GO. Second complete remission (CR2) rate was 31% and median post-relapse survival was 6.8 months (0, 17, 42.5, 53, and 80% and 3.2, 5.6, 8.9, 9, and 19.8 months in BSC, LDAC, GO, ICT, and ICT + GO subsets, respectively). Age, performance status, WBC, CR1 duration, and favorable AML karyotype, but not other cytogenetic or molecular features, influenced post-relapse outcome. Multivariate adjustment and propensity score matching showed that intensive salvage (ICT/ICT+GO/GO versus LDAC/BSC) was associated with longer post-relapse survival, at least in patients with CR1 duration >/=12 months (P = 0.001 and 0.0005, respectively). Of interest, GO appeared to be as effective as standard ICT, and ICT + GO combination more effective than standard ICT. In conclusion, older patients with CR1 duration >/=12 months appeared to benefit from intensive salvage and results observed with GO-containing salvage suggest that GO combination studies should be actively pursued in this setting.","['Sarkozy, Clementine', 'Gardin, Claude', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Merabet, Fathia', 'Turlure, Pascal', 'Malfuson, Jean-Valere', 'Pautas, Cecile', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Celli-Lebras, Karine', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Terre, Christine', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Sarkozy C', 'Gardin C', 'Gachard N', 'Merabet F', 'Turlure P', 'Malfuson JV', 'Pautas C', 'Micol JB', 'Thomas X', 'Quesnel B', 'Celli-Lebras K', 'Preudhomme C', 'Terre C', 'Fenaux P', 'Chevret S', 'Castaigne S', 'Dombret H']","['Hematology Department, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), University Paris 7, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130807,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/*methods', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23498 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Sep;88(9):758-64. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23498.

Developing a clearer understanding of the associations between HRQOL, lifestyle behaviors, and medical and demographic variables (e.g., age/developmental stage at time of diagnosis) is an important step toward developing more targeted behavioral interventions for this population. METHOD: Cross-sectional questionnaires were completed by 170 CCSs who were diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, or a cancer of the central nervous system (CNS) and treated at a comprehensive cancer center between 1992 and 2007. Questionnaires addressed weight status, lifestyle behaviors, aspects of HRQOL, and intervention preferences. RESULTS: Adolescent and young adult survivors (AYAs) and survivors of CNS tumors or lymphoma reported significantly (p < .05) poorer HRQOL across multiple domains compared to those diagnosed at an earlier age, survivors of leukemia or sarcoma, and healthy populations. A significant proportion also failed to meet national recommendations for dietary intakes (39-94 %) and physical activity (65 %). Female survivors reported poorer physical functioning and consumed less dietary fiber and fruits and vegetables than did male survivors. They also expressed the strongest interest in participating in diet and exercise interventions. CONCLUSION: Findings support the premise that females, AYAs, and survivors of cancers of the CNS or lymphoma are ""at risk"" subgroups within the CCS population for poor dietary practices, sedentary behaviors, and poor HRQOL. Future research should focus on developing diet and PA interventions to improve HRQOL that target these groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Greater consideration of the role of gender, developmental stage, and the HRQOL challenges facing CCSs may help researchers to develop targeted behavioral interventions for those who stand to benefit the most.","['Badr, Hoda', 'Chandra, Joya', 'Paxton, Raheem J', 'Ater, Joann L', 'Urbauer, Diana', 'Cruz, Cody Scott', 'Demark-Wahnefried, Wendy']","['Badr H', 'Chandra J', 'Paxton RJ', 'Ater JL', 'Urbauer D', 'Cruz CS', 'Demark-Wahnefried W']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA, hoda.badr@mssm.edu.']",['eng'],"['K01 CA158000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA136056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03CA136537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130608,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', '*Health Status', 'Humans', '*Life Style', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/psychology/therapy', 'Patient Preference/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', '*Quality of Life/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC3825822,['NIHMS490557'],2013/06/12 06:00,2014/07/19 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-013-0289-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2013 Dec;7(4):523-34. doi: 10.1007/s11764-013-0289-3.

As expected, the most common tumor encountered in exfoliative urine cytology is urothelial carcinoma. While the sensitivity of urinary tract cytology for the diagnosis of low-grade urothelial carcinomas is low, its sensitivity and accuracy for high grade urothelial carcinomas is much higher. However, nonurothelial malignancies, such as hematopoietic malignancies, can also be encountered in urine specimens. Leukemic cells in urine can be diagnosed readily by cytological examination in cases where more invasive procedures are difficult to perform. Additionally, cell block sections can be utilized to determine the immunocytochemical profile of the tumor cells to confirm the diagnosis. Herein we report a case of a 75-year-old man with a past medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who presented with congested heart failure and painless macroscopic hematuria.

Arc expression is robustly induced by activity, and Arc protein localizes to both active synapses and the nucleus. Whereas its synaptic function has been examined, it is not clear why or how Arc is localized to the nucleus. We found that murine Arc nuclear expression is regulated by synaptic activity in vivo and in vitro. We identified distinct regions of Arc that control its localization, including a nuclear localization signal, a nuclear retention domain and a nuclear export signal. Arc localization to the nucleus promotes an activity-induced increase in the expression of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, which decreases GluA1 (also called Gria1) transcription and synaptic strength. We further show that Arc nuclear localization regulates homeostatic plasticity. Thus, Arc mediates the homeostatic response to increased activity by translocating to the nucleus, increasing promyelocytic leukemia protein expression and decreasing GluA1 transcription, ultimately downscaling synaptic strength.","['Korb, Erica', 'Wilkinson, Carol L', 'Delgado, Ryan N', 'Lovero, Kathryn L', 'Finkbeiner, Steven']","['Korb E', 'Wilkinson CL', 'Delgado RN', 'Lovero KL', 'Finkbeiner S']","['Gladstone Institutes of Neurological Disease, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['F31 MH087009/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'RR018928/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '2 P01 AG022074/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', '2 R01 NS39074/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045191/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5 F31 MH087009/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AG022074/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'C06 RR018928/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007618/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS039074/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130609,United States,Nat Neurosci,Nature neuroscience,9809671,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein)', '0 (Dlg4 protein, mouse)', '0 (GABA-A Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Receptors, AMPA)', '0 (activity regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein)', '4368-28-9 (Tetrodotoxin)', 'EC 2.7.4.8 (Guanylate Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'TFZ3H25BS1 (glutamate receptor ionotropic, AMPA 1)', 'Y37615DVKC (Bicuculline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bicuculline/pharmacology', 'Brain/cytology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials/drug effects/genetics', 'GABA-A Receptor Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Guanylate Kinases/metabolism', 'Homeostasis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neurons/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Receptors, AMPA/*metabolism', 'Tetrodotoxin/pharmacology', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3703835,['NIHMS479700'],2013/06/12 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['nn.3429 [pii]', '10.1038/nn.3429 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Neurosci. 2013 Jul;16(7):874-83. doi: 10.1038/nn.3429.

METHODS: Baseline data were collected as part of Connect(R) CLL Registry, a prospective observational study initiated in community, academic, and government centers. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were provided by clinicians. Patients reported HRQOL using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), EQ-5D, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu). Mean scores were analyzed, with statistical significance of differences determined by ANOVA. Multivariate analysis also considered age and line of therapy. RESULTS: Baseline HRQOL data were available for 1,140 patients: 710 (62 %) men and 430 (38 %) women from 161 centers. Patients were predominantly white (89 %) with mean age 69 +/- 11 years. Women reported significantly worse global fatigue (P <0.0001), fatigue severity (P <0.0001), and fatigue-related interference (P = 0.0005) versus men (BFI). Pain/discomfort (P = 0.0077), usual activities (P = 0.0015), and anxiety/depression (P = 0.0117) were significantly worse in women than in men (EQ-5D). With women reporting a better social/family score (P = 0.0238) and men reporting a better physical score (P = 0.0002), the mean FACT-G total score did not differ by gender. However, the mean FACT-Leu total score was better among men versus women (P = 0.0223), primarily because the mean leukemia subscale score was significantly better among men (P <0.0001). Multivariate analysis qualitatively confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Connect(R) CLL Registry results indicate that significant differences exist in certain HRQOL domains, as women reported greater levels of fatigue and worse functioning in physical domains.","['Pashos, Chris L', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Weiss, Mark', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Farber, Charles', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Sharman, Jeff', 'Grinblatt, David', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Kozloff, Mark', 'Swern, Arlene S', 'Street, Thomas K', 'Sullivan, Kristen A', 'Harding, Gale', 'Khan, Zeba M']","['Pashos CL', 'Flowers CR', 'Kay NE', 'Weiss M', 'Lamanna N', 'Farber C', 'Lerner S', 'Sharman J', 'Grinblatt D', 'Flinn IW', 'Kozloff M', 'Swern AS', 'Street TK', 'Sullivan KA', 'Harding G', 'Khan ZM']","['United BioSource Corporation, 430 Bedford Street, Suite 300, Lexington, MA, 02420, USA, chris.pashos@unitedbiosource.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130608,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Depression/etiology', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*physiopathology/*psychology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Sex Factors']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-013-1854-z [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2013 Oct;21(10):2853-60. doi: 10.1007/s00520-013-1854-z.

In acute myeloid leukemia cells carrying the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, we observed high rates of FLT3-ITD-dependent CHK1 Ser 280 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition and RNA interference identified Pim1/2, not Akt, as effectors of this phosphorylation. Pim1 catalyzed Ser 280 phosphorylation in vitro and ectopic expression of Pim1/2-induced CHK1 phosphorylation. Ser 280 phosphorylation did not modify CHK1 localization, but facilitated its cell cycle and resistance functions in leukemic cells. FLT3, PIM or CHK1 inhibitors synergized with DNA-damaging agents to induce apoptosis, allowing cells to bypass the etoposide-induced G2/M arrest. Consistently, etoposide-induced CHK1-dependent phosphorylations of CDC25C on Ser 216 and histone H3 on Thr11 were decreased upon FLT3 inhibition. Accordingly, ectopic expression of CHK1 improved the resistance of FLT3-ITD cells and maintained histone H3 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage, whereas expression of unphosphorylated Ser 280Ala mutant did not. Finally, FLT3- and Pim-dependent phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser 280 was confirmed in primary blasts from patients.

JAK inhibitors by themselves are inadequate in producing selective clonal suppression in MPN and are associated with hematopoietic toxicities. MK-2206 is a potent allosteric AKT inhibitor that was well tolerated, including no evidence of myelosuppression, in a phase I study of solid tumors. Herein, we show that inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling by MK-2206 affected the growth of both JAK2V617F- or MPLW515L-expressing cells via reduced phosphorylation of AKT and inhibition of its downstream signaling molecules. Moreover, we demonstrate that MK-2206 synergizes with ruxolitinib in suppressing the growth of JAK2V617F-mutant SET2 cells. Importantly, MK-2206 suppressed colony formation from hematopoietic progenitor cells in patients with primary myelofibrosis and alleviated hepatosplenomegaly and reduced megakaryocyte burden in the bone marrows, livers and spleens of mice with MPLW515L-induced MPN.

Given their relative rarity, aggressive nature, and poor prognosis, little is known about the risk of subsequent malignancies at other sites. Our objective was to determine if women with UPSC or CC are at increased risk of subsequent malignancies. METHODS: Women diagnosed with UPSC or CC were identified from the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) Program from 1973 to 2005. Cases with a second gynecologic malignancy were excluded. Using SEER*Stat software, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of subsequent malignancies were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 8045 and 1740 patients were diagnosed with UPSC and CC, respectively. Four hundred sixty-one (5.7%) of the UPSC cases were diagnosed with at least 1 additional nongynecologic malignancy. Significant associations were found with the following malignancies: the renal pelvis, soft-tissue sarcomas, acute myeloid leukemia, the bladder, and colon. Seventy-eight CC cases (4.5%) were diagnosed with at least 1 additional malignancy. In comparison with the baseline population risk, there was no statistically significant increased risk of any subsequent malignancy with a primary diagnosis of CC. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large population-based analysis of second primary malignancies after type II endometrial cancers. Uterine papillary serous carcinoma is associated with increased risks of certain subsequent malignancies, and providers should be aware of these when following up patients with this diagnosis, especially those with stage I disease. In contrast, no such associations were found with CC in this cohort.","['Hinshaw, Hilary D', 'Smith, Ashlee', 'Rungruang, Bunja', 'Kelley, Joseph L Jr', 'Beriwal, Sushil', 'Krivak, Thomas C', 'Sukumvanich, Paniti', 'Olawaiye, Alexander B']","['Hinshaw HD', 'Smith A', 'Rungruang B', 'Kelley JL Jr', 'Beriwal S', 'Krivak TC', 'Sukumvanich P', 'Olawaiye AB']","[""Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Magee-Women's Hospital of UPMC, 300 Halket St., Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Gynecol Cancer,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,9111626,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/*complications/epidemiology/pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/*complications/epidemiology/pathology', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/*complications/epidemiology/pathology', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Uterine Neoplasms']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/02/19 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/IGC.0b013e3182959053 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2013 Jul;23(6):1044-9. doi: 10.1097/IGC.0b013e3182959053.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the PIG-A-null phenotype is readily detected by flow cytometry. Using PIG-A, we have now provided the first in vitro measurement of mu in myeloid cells, using cultures of CD34+ cells that are transduced with either the AML-ETO or the MLL-AF9 fusion genes and expanded with cytokines. For the AML-ETO cultures, the median mu value was approximately 9.4x10(-7) (range approximately 3.6-23x10(-7)) per cell division. In contrast, few spontaneous mutations were observed in the MLL-AF9 cultures. Knockdown of p53 or introduction of mutant NRAS or FLT3 alleles did not have much of an effect on mu.

In this study, we aimed to better understand Hh signaling in normal hematopoiesis and AML by molecularly and functionally analyzing more than 200 primary human AML patient samples compared with nonleukemic controls. Gene expression analysis indicated that Hh pathway transcripts were similarly regulated in AML and nonleukemic controls, regardless of whether samples were purified based on primitive phenotypes. Consistent with these results, pharmacologic inhibition of Smoothened (SMO) did not preferentially reduce in vitro colony formation of AML versus normal progenitors. Using a unique analytic approach, messenger RNA expression of membrane receptor SMO was found to be unexpectedly rare within all hematopoietic samples analyzed, which is indicative of heterogeneity at the level of Hh signaling machinery. In contrast, abundant SMO expression could be readily detected in the nonhematopoietic fraction of human and murine bone marrow (BM) cells. Our predictions of increased SMO(+) cell frequencies within nonhematopoietic BM fractions were further supported by single-cell protein analyses. Although we did not find support for cell-autonomous sensitivity of AML cells to Hh pathway inhibition, we alternatively suggest that nonhematopoietic BM cells represent an indirect target through which primitive normal and leukemic cells can be modulated. These findings suggest current approaches to applying Hh inhibition should be carefully reevaluated to account for BM niche cell regulation that might be selectively Hh responsive.","['Boyd, Allison L', 'Salci, Kyle R', 'Shapovalova, Zoya', 'McIntyre, Brendan A S', 'Bhatia, Mickie']","['Boyd AL', 'Salci KR', 'Shapovalova Z', 'McIntyre BA', 'Bhatia M']","['McMaster Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada; Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2012/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00507-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.05.287 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Oct;41(10):858-869.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.05.287.

Hitherto the most exploited target is CD33, a myeloid differentiation antigen found on AML blasts in most patients and, perhaps, leukemic stem cells in some. Treatment efforts have focused on conjugated antibodies, particularly gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), an anti-CD33 antibody carrying a toxic calicheamicin-g 1 derivative that, after intracellular hydrolytic release, induces DNA strand breaks, apoptosis, and cell death. Serving as paradigm for this strategy, GO was the first anti-cancer immunoconjugate to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. While efficacious as monotherapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), GO alone induces remissions in less than 25-35% of non-APL AML patients. However, emerging data from well controlled trials now indicate that GO improves survival for many non-APL AML patients, supporting the conclusion that CD33 is a clinically relevant target for some disease subsets. It is thus unfortunate that GO has become unavailable in many parts of the world, and the drug's usefulness should be reconsidered and selected patients granted access to this immunoconjugate.","['Cowan, Andrew J', 'Laszlo, George S', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Cowan AJ', 'Laszlo GS', 'Estey EH', 'Walter RB']","['Hematology/Oncology Fellowship Program, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA155524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA015704-35S6/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA155524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130601,Singapore,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*immunology']",PMC3683663,['NIHMS447702'],2013/06/12 06:00,2014/01/25 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['4181 [pii]', '10.2741/4181 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2013 Jun 1;18:1311-34. doi: 10.2741/4181.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A multicenter hospital-based case-control study was carried out in 13 states in Brazil between 1999 and 2007. Mothers of 176 ALL (acute lymphocytic leukemia) and 55 AML (acute myeloid leukemia) cases and 419 controls were enrolled and interviewed. Data on maternal exposure to HDSC occurring 3months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and during breastfeeding were obtained. Data were also gathered on paternal exposure to HDSC before pregnancy. Unconditional logistic regression was performed and odds ratios (OR) on the association between HDSC use and EAL were obtained after adjustment for hormonal intake during pregnancy, maternal age, education, birth weight, and the child skin color. RESULTS: An adjusted OR of 1.78 (95% C.I. 1.13-2.81) was observed between maternal exposure to HDSC in the first trimester of pregnancy and ALL. Regarding AML, an adjusted OR of 2.43 (95% C.I. 1.13-5.22) was found for maternal exposure to HDSC during breastfeeding. No association between maternal exposure to HDSC during pregnancy and ALL or AML was observed in children with MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: Results in this study seem to support the hypothesis that maternal exposure to HDSC during pregnancy may be involved in the etiology of leukemia in children under 2years of age.","['Couto, Arnaldo C', 'Ferreira, Jeniffer D', 'Rosa, Ana C S', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Koifman, Sergio']","['Couto AC', 'Ferreira JD', 'Rosa AC', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Koifman S']","['National School of Public Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Hair Dyes)', '0 (Hair Preparations)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Brazil', 'Breast Feeding', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hair Dyes/*adverse effects', 'Hair Preparations/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', '*Maternal Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/11/14 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(13)00128-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2013.05.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2013 Sep 5;205(1):46-52. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2013.05.012.

The aims of this study were: (a) to establish the expression patterns of amh, sox9 and sf-1 mRNA in the gonad-adrenal-mesonephros (GAM) complexes of neonatal TSD-male and TSD-female caimans, (b) to compare the expression of these genes between TSD-females and HSD-females (born from E2-exposed eggs incubated at the male-producing temperature) and (c) to evaluate whether in ovo exposure to a low dose of E2 or bisphenol A (BPA) or to a high dose of endosulfan (END) modifies amh, sox9 or sf-1 mRNA expressions in neonatal males. The mRNA expressions of amh, sox9 and sf-1 in GAM complexes from TSD-males and TSD-females and from HSD-females were quantitatively compared by RT-PCR. A sexually dimorphic pattern of amh and sox9 mRNA expression was found, with a higher expression in TSD-males than in TSD-females. sf-1 mRNA did not differ between TSD-males and TSD-females. HSD-females exhibited a higher expression of sox9 than TSD-females. In males, increased mRNA expression of sex-determining genes was observed after in ovo exposure to END. E2 decreased sox9 but increased sf-1 mRNA expression. Changes induced by BPA were evident although not significant.

We wanted to determine the incidence and risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias during AHCT. The study included 983 patients (median age, 58 years [range, 19 to 77]; 61% male) who underwent AHCT between August 2006 and December 2010 at a single institution and for whom all relevant medical records were available for review. AHCT was done for plasma cell disorders in 58% patients and for lymphoma or leukemia in the remaining. Overall, 92 patients (9.4%) developed a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia at a median of 9 days posttransplantation (range, 0 to 18) and with a median duration of less than 1 day (range, <1 to 17 days). Atrial fibrillation was the most common and seen in 71 patients (7%), followed by atrial flutter and supraventricular tachycardia in 12 (1%) and 8 (1%) patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age older than 63 years, presence of premature supraventricular complexes or atrioventricular conduction delay on pretransplantation electrocardiogram, and history of any prior arrhythmia increased the risk of arrhythmia. Development of arrhythmia resulted in longer outpatient follow-up after AHCT, with the median follow-up for those developing an arrhythmia of 22 days compared with 19 days for the rest; P < .001. In conclusion, 9% of patients undergoing ASCT developed supraventricular arrhythmias posttransplantation, and this risk was elevated among older patients, those with a prior history of arrhythmias, and those with pretransplantation electrocardiographic abnormalities.","['Singla, Abhishek', 'Hogan, William J', 'Ansell, Stephen M', 'Buadi, Francis K', 'Dingli, David', 'Dispenzieri, Angela', 'Gastineau, Dennis A', 'Gertz, Morie A', 'Hayman, Suzanne R', 'Inwards, David J', 'Johnston, Patrick B', 'Lacy, Martha Q', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Micallef, Ivana N', 'Porrata, Luis F', 'Kumar, Shaji K']","['Singla A', 'Hogan WJ', 'Ansell SM', 'Buadi FK', 'Dingli D', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Gastineau DA', 'Gertz MA', 'Hayman SR', 'Inwards DJ', 'Johnston PB', 'Lacy MQ', 'Litzow MR', 'Micallef IN', 'Porrata LF', 'Kumar SK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.']",['eng'],"['K12 CA090628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Atrial Fibrillation/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tachycardia, Supraventricular/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3752294,['NIHMS491329'],2013/06/12 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(13)00232-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.05.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Aug;19(8):1233-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.05.019.

We performed a retrospective review of 271 adults with a hematologic malignancy undergoing allogeneic HCT to determine the incidence of and risk factors for IFD and to examine the impact of IFD on nonrelapse mortality and overall survival. We defined IFD using standard criteria and selected proven and probable cases for analysis. Diagnoses in the study group included acute leukemia (42%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (24%), myelodysplastic syndrome (15%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (5%), and other hematologic disorders (14%). Conditioning included reduced-intensity (64%) and myeloablative (36%) regimens. Donor sources were HLA-matched sibling (60%), matched unrelated (20%), haploidentical (12%), and cord blood (8%). A total of 51 episodes of IFD were observed in 42 subjects (15%). Aspergillus spp (47%) was the most frequent causative organism, followed by Candida spp (43%). The majority of IFD cases (67%) were reported after day +100 post-HCT. In multivariate analysis, haploidentical donor transplantation (hazard ratio [HR], 3.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-9.77; P = .005) and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.07-6.10; P = .03) were risk factors for the development of IFD.

IFD-related mortality was 33.3%. Nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed IFD compared with those without IFD (P < .001, log-rank test). Patients with IFD had lower overall survival (5.8 months versus 76.1 months; P < .001, log-rank test).

However, genetic regulatory networks involved in cardiac differentiation are not clearly understood. Among stem cell differentiation models, mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells, are employed for studying (epi)genetic regulation of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Here, we comprehensively assessed cardiogenic differentiation potential of 5-azacytidine (Aza) on P19 EC-cells, associated gene expression profiles and the changes in DNA methylation, histone acetylation and activated-ERK signaling status during differentiation. Initial exposure of Aza to cultured EC-cells leads to an efficient (55%) differentiation to cardiomyocyte-rich embryoid bodies with a threefold (16.8%) increase in the cTnI+ cardiomyocytes. Expression levels of cardiac-specific gene markers i.e., Isl-1, BMP-2, GATA-4, and alpha-MHC were up-regulated following Aza induction, accompanied by differential changes in their methylation status particularly that of BMP-2 and alpha-MHC. Additionally, increases in the levels of acetylated-H3 and pERK were observed during Aza-induced cardiac differentiation. These studies demonstrate that Aza is a potent cardiac inducer when treated during the initial phase of differentiation of mouse P19 EC-cells and its effect is brought about epigenetically and co-ordinatedly by hypo-methylation and histone acetylation-mediated hyper-expression of cardiogenesis-associated genes and involving activation of ERK signaling.","['Abbey, Deepti', 'Seshagiri, Polani B']","['Abbey D', 'Seshagiri PB']","['Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560 012, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130607,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Heart/embryology', 'Histones/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mesoderm/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Organogenesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(13)00680-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.044 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2013 Sep 10;526(2):364-73. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.044.

DNA repair gene polymorphisms may influence the capacity to repair DNA damage, and thus lead to an increased cancer susceptibility. X-ray repair cross-complementing groups 3 (XRCC3), a DNA repair gene, may be involved in acute myeloid leukemia susceptibility. The objective of the current study was to investigate the association of Thr241Met polymorphism of XRCC3 gene with the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: This study included 78 AML patients and 121 healthy individuals without cancer. We used polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay to determine XRCC3 genotypes. RESULTS: The XRCC3 variant genotype (Thr/Met+Met/Met) was more frequent in AML patients than in healthy controls (OR=2.76, 95% CI: 1.52-4.98, P=0.001). Our study revealed a statistically significant association between variant genotype (Thr/Met+Met/Met) and AML de novo compared to secondary AML (P=0.007). No significant associations were found between any genotype and age at diagnosis, number of white blood cells and subtype of AML. Overall survival of patients with Thr/Thr genotype was better than those of variant Thr/Met and Met/Met genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism may be a genetic risk factor for AML, particularly in male patients with de novo AML from the central part of Romania.","['Banescu, Claudia', 'Tilinca, Mariana', 'Benedek, Erzsebeth Lazar', 'Demian, Smaranda', 'Macarie, Ioan', 'Duicu, Carmen', 'Dobreanu, Minodora']","['Banescu C', 'Tilinca M', 'Benedek EL', 'Demian S', 'Macarie I', 'Duicu C', 'Dobreanu M']","['Department of Medical Genetics, University of Medicine and Pharmacy Tirgu Mures, 38 Gh Marinescu St, 540139, Romania. claudia.banescu@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130604,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (X-ray repair cross complementing protein 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Romania', 'Whites/*genetics']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(13)00704-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.054 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2013 Sep 10;526(2):478-83. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.054.

Herein, we described a CLL patient with 17p deletion who developed Richter syndrome with extranodal involvement of the liver soon after RIC allo-SCT despite apparent acute graft-versus-host disease. The majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients respond well to chemoimmunotherapy.

Current treatment approaches for patients with 17p deletion include agents acting independently from the DNA damage pathway, such as alemtuzumab and high-dose corticosteroids. RIC allo-SCT for consolidation can achieve long-term remission in this ultra-high-risk CLL group.(1,2) Richter syndrome (RS) represents the clinicopathologic transformation of CLL to an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).(3) RS appearing after allo-SCT can be managed by tapering of immunosuppression, followed by dose-escalated donor lymphocyte infusion titrated to the degree of leukemia response and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) encountered.(4) Herein, we describe a CLL patient with 17p deletion who developed RS with extranodal involvement of the liver soon after RIC allo-SCT despite apparent acute GVHD (aGVHD).","['Salihoglu, A', 'Ozbalak, M', 'Keskin, D', 'Tecimer, T', 'Soysal, T', 'Ferhanoglu, B']","['Salihoglu A', 'Ozbalak M', 'Keskin D', 'Tecimer T', 'Soysal T', 'Ferhanoglu B']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130606,United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,,IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Syndrome']",,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-1345(12)01304-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2013 Sep;45(7):2845-8. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.12.001.

METHODS: Retrospective, monocentric descriptive study of consecutive cases of acquired von Willebrand syndrome diagnosed between 2000 and 2012. Diagnostic criteria included: absence of a past history of mucocutaneous bleeding, with low plasma levels of factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (VWF), ristocetine cofactor activity (RCo) and antigen (Ag). RESULTS: Nine men were diagnosed with von Willebrand syndrome. Six of them presented with recent mucocutaneous bleeding. In eight cases, the biological phenotype was a type 2 von Willebrand disease, with decreased VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratio. A lymphoproliferative disease with circulating paraprotein was identified in all patients, including one chronic lymphoid leukemia, three Waldenstrom and one marginal zone lymphomas, four monoclonal gammapathies of unknown significance. Screening for an anti-VWF inhibitor was negative. Symptomatic treatment using infusion of VWF concentrates was administrated in the presence of severe mucocutaneaous bleeding. Five patients received intravenous immunoglobulins with a good response only in patients with G isotype paraprotein. A chemotherapy was initiated if indicated for the underlying disorder. Three of the four patients who achieved remission of the associated lymphoma had a subsequent improvement of plasma VWF levels, while all other patients remained deficient. CONCLUSION: Acquired von Willebrand syndrome is a rare but potentially serious disease. The diagnostic should be suspected in adults with unusual mucocutaneous bleeding, with or without prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and confirmed with a decreased plasma level of VWF (Ag and RCo). An associated haematological, neoplastic or cardiac valvular disease must be searched.","['Boissier, E', 'Darnige, L', 'Dougados, J', 'Arlet, J-B', 'Dupeux, S', 'Georgin-Lavialle, S', 'Caron, C', 'Tapon-Bretaudiere, J', 'Pouchot, J', 'Ranque, B']","['Boissier E', 'Darnige L', 'Dougados J', 'Arlet JB', 'Dupeux S', 'Georgin-Lavialle S', 'Caron C', 'Tapon-Bretaudiere J', 'Pouchot J', 'Ranque B']","['Service de medecine interne, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France."", 'Service de medecine interne, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Service de medecine interne, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Service de medecine interne, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Service de medecine interne, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France; Faculte de medecine, universite Paris Descartes, Paris Sorbonne Cite, 75005 Paris, France.', ""Institut d'hematologie-transfusion, centre de biologie-pathologie, CHRU de Lille, 59037 Lille, France."", ""Service d'hematologie, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France; Faculte de medecine, universite Paris Descartes, Paris Sorbonne Cite, 75005 Paris, France."", 'Service de medecine interne, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France; Faculte de medecine, universite Paris Descartes, Paris Sorbonne Cite, 75005 Paris, France.', 'Service de medecine interne, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France; Faculte de medecine, universite Paris Descartes, Paris Sorbonne Cite, 75005 Paris, France.

As patients clinically decline, constipation often leads to increased pain and distress, while its enteral treatment becomes more challenging. METHOD: There is little information about the safety and use of methylnaltrexone in children. We present the case of a 17-month-old girl with progressive leukemia who was at the end of her life and whose severe opioid-induced constipation and rectal prolapse was successfully treated with the mu-opioid-receptor antagonist methylnaltrexone. We selected a lower dose based on our lack of experience with methylnaltrexone in this age group and concern for potential complications given her rectal prolapse. DISCUSSION: Opioid-induced constipation, abdominal distention, and rectal prolapse caused our patient's most distressing symptoms, even in the context of advanced cancer. A single dose of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone (0.12 mg/kg) resolved her constipation and rectal prolapse within one hour. Although evidence is limited, the drug has successfully been used in pediatric patients with no reported side effects to date. We recommend its use earlier in the course of severe opioid-induced constipation in children unable to tolerate an oral laxation regimen. Prospective research is needed to establish the parameters for use of this effective agent in children who cannot tolerate other regimens.","['Laubisch, Jamie E', 'Baker, Justin N']","['Laubisch JE', 'Baker JN']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130607,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,"['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '0 (Narcotic Antagonists)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0RK7M7IABE (methylnaltrexone)', '5S6W795CQM (Naltrexone)']",IM,"['Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects', 'Constipation/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Naltrexone/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Narcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Palliative Care', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Rectal Prolapse/*drug therapy']",PMC3822361,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/07/10 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jpm.2012.0600 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2013 Nov;16(11):1486-8. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2012.0600.

However, any practical ligand set (of active or inactive compounds) chosen for deriving new virtual screening approaches cannot fully represent all relevant chemical space for potential new compounds. In this study, we have taken a retrospective approach to evaluate virtual screening methods for the leukemia target kinase ABL1 and its drug-resistant mutant ABL1-T315I. 'Dual active' inhibitors against both targets were grouped together with inactive ligands chosen from different decoy sets and tested with virtual screening approaches with and without explicit use of target structures (docking). We show how various scoring functions and choice of inactive ligand sets influence overall and early enrichment of the libraries. Although ligand-based methods, for example principal component analyses of chemical properties, can distinguish some decoy sets from active compounds, the addition of target structural information via docking improves enrichment, and explicit consideration of multiple target conformations (i.e. types I and II) achieves best enrichment of active versus inactive ligands, even without assuming knowledge of the binding mode. We believe that this study can be extended to other therapeutically important kinases in prospective virtual screening studies.","['Gani, Osman A B S M', 'Narayanan, Dilip', 'Engh, Richard A']","['Gani OA', 'Narayanan D', 'Engh RA']","['The Norwegian Structural Biology Center, Department of Chemistry, University of Tromso, 9037, Tromso, Norway.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20131001,England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding Sites', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*standards', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Mutation', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics']",PMC4265857,,2013/06/12 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cbdd.12170 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2013 Nov;82(5):506-19. doi: 10.1111/cbdd.12170.

However, the relationship between these two functional polymorphisms and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility has not been explored. In this study, we performed a case-control study to explore the association between MDM2 and P53 gene polymorphisms and ALL risk in a Chinese population. We found an increased adult ALL risk associated with the MDM2 GG (odds ratio [OR]=2.79, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]=1.67-4.68) and TG (OR=1.49, 95% CI=0.95-2.53) genotypes. An increased risk associated with the P53 Pro/Pro genotype (OR=2.22, 95% CI=1.30-3.79) compared with the Arg/Arg genotype was also observed. Furthermore, the gene-gene interaction of MDM2 and P53 polymorphisms increased the adult ALL risk in a super-multiplicative manner (OR for the presence of both MDM2 GG and P53 Pro/Pro genotypes=8.05, 95% CI=2.53-25.58).

This translocation involves the RUNX1 and ETO genes. The breakpoints regions for t(8;21) are located at intron 5 and intron 1 of the RUNX1 and ETO gene respectively. To date, no homologous sequences have been found in these regions to explain their recombination. The breakpoint regions of RUNX1 gene are characterized by the presence of DNasaI hypersensitive sites and topoisomerase II cleavage sites, but no information exists about complementary regions of ETO gene. Here, we report analysis of chromatin structure of ETO breakpoint regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed with antibodies specific to acetylated histone H3, H4, and total histone H1. Nucleosomal distribution at the ETO locus was evaluated by determining total levels of histone H3. Our data show that in myeloid cells, the breakpoint regions at the ETO gene are enriched in hyperacetylated histone H3 compared to a control region of similar size where no translocations have been described. Moreover, acetylated H4 associates with both the whole ETO breakpoint regions as well as the control intron. Interestingly, we observed no H1 association either at the breakpoint regions or the control region of the ETO gene. Our data indicate that a common chromatin structure enriched in acetylated histones is present in breakpoint regions involved in formation of (8;21) leukemic translocation.","['Stuardo, Marcela', 'Nicovani, Sandra', 'Javed, Amjad', 'Gutierrez, Soraya']","['Stuardo M', 'Nicovani S', 'Javed A', 'Gutierrez S']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.']",['eng'],['R01 AR062091/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics/*physiology']",PMC7770807,['NIHMS1656444'],2013/06/08 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24605 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2013 Nov;114(11):2569-76. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24605.,"['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['CHROMATIN ORGANIZATION', 'CHROMOSOMAL TRANSLOCATION', 'ETO GENE', 'HISTONE ACETYLATION']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two critical properties contribute to the functional role of CSCs in the establishment and recurrence of cancerous tumors: their capacity for self-renewal and their potential to differentiate into unlimited heterogeneous populations of cancer cells. These findings suggest that CSCs may represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment and/or prevention of tumor progression, since they appear to be involved in cell migration, invasion, metastasis, and treatment resistance-all of which lead to poor clinical outcomes. The identification of CSC-specific markers, the isolation and characterization of CSCs from malignant tissues, and targeting strategies for the destruction of CSCs provide a novel opportunity for cancer research. This overview describes the potential implications of several common CSC markers in the identification of CSC subpopulations that are restricted to common malignant diseases, e.g., leukemia, and breast, prostate, pancreatic, and lung cancers. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of CSC function is also discussed, as are several methods commonly used in CSC research. The potential role of the antidiabetic drug metformin- which has been shown to have effects on CSCs, and is known to function as an antitumor agent-is discussed as an example of this new class of chemotherapeutics.","['Bao, Bin', 'Ahmad, Aamir', 'Azmi, Asfar S', 'Ali, Shadan', 'Sarkar, Fazlul H']","['Bao B', 'Ahmad A', 'Azmi AS', 'Ali S', 'Sarkar FH']","['Department of Pathology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA131151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA131151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA108535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA154321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA164318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA132794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Protoc Pharmacol,Current protocols in pharmacology,9717249,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Metformin/*pharmacology', 'MicroRNAs/physiology', 'Models, Animal', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology']",PMC3733496,['NIHMS494248'],2013/06/08 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/0471141755.ph1425s61 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Protoc Pharmacol. 2013 Jun;Chapter 14:Unit 14.25. doi: 10.1002/0471141755.ph1425s61.,"['(c) 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect appeared to be independent of CMV viral load, acute graft-versus-host disease, or ganciclovir-associated neutropenia. At 1 year after HCT, early CMV reactivation was associated with reduced risk of relapse in all patients, but this did not reach significance for any disease subgroup. Furthermore, CMV reactivation was associated with increased nonrelapse mortality (HR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6) and no difference in overall mortality (HR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3).

Therefore, the primary goal in CLL treatment is to overcome resistance to apoptosis and efficiently trigger this process in leukemic cells. METHODS: Mononuclear cells were obtained from the blood of CLL patients by Histopaque-1077 sedimentation. CLL cell samples from the blood of drug treated patients, (cladribine or fludarabine with cyclophosphamide; CC or FC), as well as the cell samples of untreated patients exposed to the used drug combinations (CM, FM) or mafosfamide alone for 48 h were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions or were lysed. DNA fragmentation was evaluated by agarose electrophoresis and also cytometrically as sub-G1 population. The expression of apoptosis related proteins and H1.2 histone translocation were evaluated in lysates and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively with appropriate antibodies. RESULTS: Cladribine (C) and fludarabine (F) combined with cyclophosphamide/mafosfamide in vivo, as well as ex vivo trigger apoptosis in CLL cells. These drug combinations (CC; FC/CM; FM) induce leukemic cell apoptosis confirmed by DNA fragmentation, sub-G1 cell number, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-2), and H1.2 histone translocation in comparison with appropriate control cells, however, to a different degree. CONCLUSIONS: The kinetics and rate of drug-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells under ex vivo experiments differ between patients, mirroring the differences noticed during in vivo treatment. Individual model cell samples indicate comparable susceptibility to the used drug combinations under in vivo and ex vivo conditions.","['Zolnierczyk, Jolanta D', 'Borowiak, Arleta', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Cebula-Obrzut, Barbara', 'Rogalinska, Malgorzata', 'Kotkowska, Aleksandra', 'Wawrzyniak, Ewa', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Kilianska, Zofia M']","['Zolnierczyk JD', 'Borowiak A', 'Blonski JZ', 'Cebula-Obrzut B', 'Rogalinska M', 'Kotkowska A', 'Wawrzyniak E', 'Smolewski P', 'Robak T', 'Kilianska ZM']","['Department of Cytobiochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, PL 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Pharmacol Rep,Pharmacological reports : PR,101234999,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2013/06/08 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1734-1140(13)71022-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s1734-1140(13)71022-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Rep. 2013;65(2):460-75. doi: 10.1016/s1734-1140(13)71022-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a putative future anticancer drug, currently in phases I and II clinical studies. We recently showed that TRAIL is able to target leukemia stem cell surrogates. Here, we tested the ability of TRAIL to target cell cycle-arrested tumor cells. Cell cycle arrest was induced in tumor cell lines and xenografted tumor cells in G0, G1 or G2 using cytotoxic drugs, phase-specific inhibitors or RNA interference against cyclinB and E. Biochemical or molecular arrest at any point of the cell cycle increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, when cell cycle arrest was disabled by addition of caffeine, the antitumor activity of TRAIL was reduced. Most important for clinical translation, tumor cells from three children with B precursor or T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis upon knockdown of either cyclinB or cyclinE, arresting the cell cycle in G2 or G1, respectively. Taken together and in contrast to most conventional cytotoxic drugs, TRAIL exerts enhanced antitumor activity against cell cycle-arrested tumor cells. Therefore, TRAIL might represent an interesting drug to treat static-tumor disease, for example, during minimal residual disease.","['Ehrhardt, H', 'Wachter, F', 'Grunert, M', 'Jeremias, I']","['Ehrhardt H', 'Wachter F', 'Grunert M', 'Jeremias I']","['Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cyclin B/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin E/genetics/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', '*G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', '*G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3698546,,2013/06/08 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013179 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.179 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Jun 6;4:e661. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.179.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patented organopalladium compounds derived from the reaction of N,N-dimethyl-1-phenethylamine (dmpa) with [1,2-ethanebis(diphenylphosphine)] (dppe) exhibited a potent antitumor activity in vivo and in vitro in melanoma cells. We showed here that the cyclopalladated derivative [Pd2(R(+))C(2), N-dmpa)2(mu-dppe)Cl2], named compound 7b, was highly effective to promote cell death in the K562 human leukemia cells and its mechanisms of action were investigated. It was shown that compound 7b was able to promote exclusively apoptotic cell death in K562 cells associated to cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. This cytotoxic effect was not observed in normal peripheral mononuclear blood cells. The compound 7b-induced intrinsic apoptotic pathway was triggered by the protein thiol oxidation that resulted in the dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The preventive effect of the dithiothreitol on the compound 7b-induced cell death and all downstream events associated to apoptosis confirmed that death signal was elicited by the thiol oxidation. These findings contribute to the elucidation of the palladacycle 7b-induced cell death mechanism and present this compound as a promising drug in the CML antitumor chemotherapy.","['Moraes, V W R', 'Caires, A C F', 'Paredes-Gamero, E J', 'Rodrigues, T']","['Moraes VW', 'Caires AC', 'Paredes-Gamero EJ', 'Rodrigues T']","['Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Humanas, Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Organometallic Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism']",PMC3702286,,2013/06/08 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013190 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.190 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Jun 6;4:e658. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.190.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These enzymes catalyze the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures, and have been recognized to be involved in various diseases. In this study, we sought to determine the expressional profiles of B4GALT family in four pairs of parental and chemoresistant human leukemia cell lines and in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) of leukemia patients with multidrug resistance (MDR). The results revealed that B4GALT1 and B4GALT5 were highly expressed in four MDR cells and patients, altered levels of B4GALT1 and B4GALT5 were responsible for changed drug-resistant phenotype of HL60 and HL60/adriamycin-resistant cells. Further data showed that manipulation of these two gene expression led to increased or decreased activity of hedgehog (Hh) signaling and proportionally mutative expression of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MDR-associated protein 1 (MRP1) that are both known to be related to MDR. Thus, we propose that B4GALT1 and B4GALT5, two members of B4GALT gene family, are involved in the development of MDR of human leukemia cells, probably by regulating the activity of Hh signaling and the expression of P-gp and MRP1.","['Zhou, H', 'Ma, H', 'Wei, W', 'Ji, D', 'Song, X', 'Sun, J', 'Zhang, J', 'Jia, L']","['Zhou H', 'Ma H', 'Wei W', 'Ji D', 'Song X', 'Sun J', 'Zhang J', 'Jia L']","['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase V)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Galactosyltransferases/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Burden', 'Up-Regulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3698553,,2013/06/08 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013186 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.186 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Jun 6;4:e654. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Peripheral blood or born marrow specimens were respectively cultured in proper media. Karyograms were analyzed following G-banding. RESULTS: Of 154 blood specimens, numerical chromosomal abnormalities were identified in 20 patients, which included 19 with trisomy 21. Structural aberrations were identified in 13 patients, among which chromosome 9 aberrations were seen in 6 cases. These included 3 inversions, 1 deletion, 1 insertion and 1 duplication. All aberrations were located in pericentromere region of chromosome 9 with clinical manifestations including congenital heart disease, peculiar facial appearance, paralysis, dysplasia and/or movement disorder. Chromosome polymorphisms were found in 20 patients, most of which had absence of satellites or variation of heterochromatin on chromosome 9. Of 10 bone marrow specimens from children suspected for acute leukemia, chromosome abnormalities were identified in 5 patients. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic analysis is useful for children featuring multiple congenital abnormalities. Chromosome 9 abnormalities and their clinical relevance should attract more attention.","['Wang, Ying', 'Peng, Yongzheng', 'Chen, Xiaojiao', 'Che, Xiaoyan']","['Wang Y', 'Peng Y', 'Chen X', 'Che X']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510282, P.R.

Predominant involvement of the retina and vitreous without uveal infiltration in systemic lymphoma, mimicking a primary vitreoretinal lymphoma, is extremely rare. Our study emphasizes the importance of systemic evaluation in addition to central nervous system evaluation in all patients with newly diagnosed vitreoretinal lymphoma. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of secondary intraocular lymphoma presenting as vitreoretinal infiltrates without central nervous system involvement, mimicking primary vitreoretinal lymphoma in patients with systemic lymphoma. DESIGN Retrospective review of all vitreous aspiration biopsy samples acquired because malignant neoplasm was suspected clinically that were obtained at our institution from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2010. Review included patient clinical history, radiographic study findings, cytologic and/or histologic preparations, immunophenotypic study findings, treatment, and outcomes. SETTING Mayo Clinic pathology database. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five patients with vitreous specimens available for review. EXPOSURES: Vitreous aspiration biopsy. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Confirmation of the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). RESULTS: Of the 55 patients with vitreous specimens available for review, 3 (5%) had a DLBCL infiltration in the vitreous without any central nervous system involvement as a manifestation of systemic lymphoma. All 3 patients were men, aged 54, 66, and 73 years, and had blurred vision and floaters for several weeks before undergoing diagnostic vitrectomy. Ophthalmic examinations revealed clumps of vitreous cells but no choroidal involvement. One patient had no history of lymphoma; the diagnosis of vitreoretinal lymphoma was followed by DLBCL after a lymph node biopsy. The other 2 patients had low-grade B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia for 29 and 7 months before large-cell transformation in the eye. Patients were treated with systemic chemotherapy plus intraocular injections of rituximab or methotrexate sodium. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vitreoretinal symptoms of DLBCL in patients with systemic lymphoma may be more frequent than previously thought (5% in our study). Not all lymphomas with vitreoretinal involvement represent primary intraocular lymphomas; thorough ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with visual symptoms and complete staging in patients with documented ocular lymphoma are of utmost importance.","['Salomao, Diva R', 'Pulido, Jose S', 'Johnston, Patrick B', 'Canal-Fontcuberta, Irene', 'Feldman, Andrew L']","['Salomao DR', 'Pulido JS', 'Johnston PB', 'Canal-Fontcuberta I', 'Feldman AL']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota2Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA Ophthalmol,JAMA ophthalmology,101589539,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Brachytherapy', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Eye Neoplasms/chemistry/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Retinal Neoplasms/chemistry/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence', 'Vitrectomy', 'Vitreous Body/chemistry/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/06/08 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1695905 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.334 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Ophthalmol. 2013 Sep;131(9):1151-8. doi: 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.334.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further examine the urothelial cell inclusions that occur in inorganic arsenic-exposed humans, we evaluated two patients with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia treated for disease relapse with a combination of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide. Posttreatment examination of the patients' urine cytology specimens by light and electron microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic inclusions in exfoliated superficial urothelial cells similar to those seen in mice. The inclusions were present in decreasing quantities at 3 and 7 months after completion of treatment. No comparable inclusions were detected in exfoliated urothelial cells in urine from six individuals not treated with arsenic trioxide.

Although clustered homeobox genes are well-characterized targets of MLL and MLL fusion oncoproteins, the range of Mll-regulated genes in normal hematopoietic cells remains unknown. Here, we identify and characterize part of the Mll-dependent transcriptional network in hematopoietic stem cells with an integrated approach by using conditional loss-of-function models, genomewide expression analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and functional rescue assays. The Mll-dependent transcriptional network extends well beyond the previously appreciated Hox targets, is comprised of many characterized regulators of self-renewal, and contains target genes that are both dependent and independent of the MLL cofactor, Menin. Interestingly, PR-domain containing 16 emerged as a target gene that is uniquely effective at partially rescuing Mll-deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This work highlights the tissue-specific nature of regulatory networks under the control of MLL/Trithorax family members and provides insight into the distinctions between the participation of MLL in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemia.","['Artinger, Erika L', 'Mishra, Bibhu P', 'Zaffuto, Kristin M', 'Li, Bin E', 'Chung, Elaine K Y', 'Moore, Adrian W', 'Chen, Yufei', 'Cheng, Chao', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Artinger EL', 'Mishra BP', 'Zaffuto KM', 'Li BE', 'Chung EK', 'Moore AW', 'Chen Y', 'Cheng C', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Genetics , Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Sciences, and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['P20 RR016437/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL090036/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL090036/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR16437/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology']",PMC3718146,,2013/06/08 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1301278110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1301278110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jul 16;110(29):12000-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1301278110.

Here, we describe a novel automated flow cytometric classification focused on the analysis of the plasma-cell compartment to identify among newly diagnosed symptomatic MM patients (N=698) cases with a baseline MGUS-like profile, by comparing them to MGUS (N=497) patients and validating the classification model in 114 smoldering MM patients. Overall, 59 symptomatic MM patients (8%) showed an MGUS-like profile. Despite achieving similar CR rates after high-dose therapy/autologous stem cell transplantation vs other MM patients, MGUS-like cases had unprecedented longer time-to-progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS; ~60% at 10 years; P<0.001). Importantly, MGUS-like MM patients failing to achieve CR showed similar TTP (P=0.81) and OS (P=0.24) vs cases attaining CR. This automated classification also identified MGUS patients with shorter TTP (P=0.001, hazard ratio: 5.53) and ultra-high-risk smoldering MM (median TTP, 15 months). In summary, we have developed a biomarker that identifies a subset of symptomatic MM patients with an occult MGUS-like signature and an excellent outcome, independently of the depth of response.","['Paiva, B', 'Vidriales, M-B', 'Rosinol, L', 'Martinez-Lopez, J', 'Mateos, M-V', 'Ocio, E M', 'Montalban, M-A', 'Cordon, L', 'Gutierrez, N C', 'Corchete, L', 'Oriol, A', 'Terol, M-J', 'Echeveste, M-A', 'De Paz, R', 'De Arriba, F', 'Palomera, L', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, J', 'Granell, M', 'Gorosquieta, A', 'Alegre, A', 'Orfao, A', 'Lahuerta, J-J', 'Blade, J', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Paiva B', 'Vidriales MB', 'Rosinol L', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Mateos MV', 'Ocio EM', 'Montalban MA', 'Cordon L', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Corchete L', 'Oriol A', 'Terol MJ', 'Echeveste MA', 'De Paz R', 'De Arriba F', 'Palomera L', 'de la Rubia J', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Granell M', 'Gorosquieta A', 'Alegre A', 'Orfao A', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Blade J', 'San Miguel JF']","['1] Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain [2] IBSAL, IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130607,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', '*Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Paraproteinemias/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Plasma Cells/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,,2013/06/08 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013166 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.166 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):2056-61. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.166.

Cytokine antibody arrays were used to measure the differentially expressed cytokines in tumor tissues. The expression of CXCL16 and CD99 was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting, while the pathways involved were assessed by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of CXCL16 was investigated in 9 lymphoma cell lines (L428, RPMI-8226, KM3, Jurkat, OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly8, OCI-Ly10, Karpass299 and Raji) as well as in clinical lymphoma samples using qPCR, western blotting and immunochemistry. Soluble CXCL16 (sCXCL16) levels were measured by ELISA and proliferation was analyzed by CCK8 proliferation assays. CXCL16 was one of the upregulated chemokines when lymphoma cells where transferred from in vitro to in vivo conditions. The increased expression and secretion of CXCL16 paralleled with a decrease of mCD99L2 and was accompanied by NF-kappaB pathway activation and vice versa. CXCL16 was expressed in all 9 lymphoma cell lines with the highest levels in the Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cell line L428, the plasma cell-derived cell lines RPMI8226 and KM3 and the T leukemia-derived cell line Jurkat. Higher levels of sCXCL16 were secreted by L428 cells, the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-derived cell lines (OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly8 and OCI-Ly10) and Jurkat cells. CXCL16 was widely expressed in clinical samples of lymphoma patients with higher levels in HL compared to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Human recombinant CXCL16 had no significant effect on L428 cell proliferation, but was able to stimulate CD4+ T lymphocytes to proliferate. CXCL16, inversely correlated with CD99 expression in Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (H/RS) cells, is widely expressed in diverse types of lymphomas.","['Liu, Fang', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Tang, Hongping', 'Zhou, Xinhua', 'Wu, Ziqing', 'Tang, Dongsheng', 'Zhao, Tong']","['Liu F', 'Zhang Y', 'Tang H', 'Zhou X', 'Wu Z', 'Tang D', 'Zhao T']","['Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Medical School, Foshan University, Foshan, Guangdong 528000, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130605,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL16 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL16)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL16', 'Chemokines, CXC/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Scavenger/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2013/06/08 06:00,2014/02/28 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2522 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Aug;30(2):783-92. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2522.

The regions around the GH1 and GH2 domains of GIPC1 are involved in dimerization and interaction with myosin VI (MYO6), respectively. The PDZ domain of GIPC1 is involved in interactions with transmembrane proteins [IGF1R, NTRK1, ADRB1, DRD2, TGFbetaR3 (transforming growth factorbeta receptor type III), SDC4, SEMA4C, LRP1, NRP1, GLUT1, integrin alpha5 and VANGL2], cytosolic signaling regulators (APPL1 and RGS19) and viral proteins (HBc and HPV-18 E6). GIPC1 is an adaptor protein with dimerizing ability that loads PDZ ligands as cargoes for MYO6-dependent endosomal trafficking. GIPC1 is required for cell-surface expression of IGF1R and TGFbetaR3. GIPC1 is also required for integrin recycling during cell migration, angiogenesis and cytokinesis. On early endosomes, GIPC1 assembles receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and APPL1 for activation of PI3K-AKT signaling, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and RGS19 for attenuation of inhibitory Galpha signaling. GIPC1 upregulation in breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers promotes tumor proliferation and invasion, whereas GIPC1 downregulation in cervical cancer with human papillomavirus type 18 infection leads to resistance to cytostatic transforming growth factorbeta signaling. GIPC2 is downregulated in acute lymphocytic leukemia owing to epigenetic silencing, while Gipc2 is upregulated in estrogen-induced mammary tumors. Somatic mutations of GIPC2 occur in malignant melanoma, and colorectal and ovarian cancers. Germ-line mutations of the GIPC3 or MYO6 gene cause nonsyndromic hearing loss. As GIPC proteins are involved in trafficking, signaling and recycling of RTKs, GPCRs, integrins and other transmembrane proteins, dysregulation of GIPCs results in human pathologies, such as cancer and hereditary deafness.","['Katoh, Masaru']",['Katoh M'],"['Division of Integrative Omics and Bioinformatics, National Cancer Centre, Tokyo, Japan. mkatoh-kkr@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130607,United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', '*Proteomics']",PMC3701287,,2013/06/08 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['emm201349 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2013.49 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Mol Med. 2013 Jun 7;45:e26. doi: 10.1038/emm.2013.49.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool for dissecting the BCR and TCR populations at high resolution, but robust computational analyses are required to interpret such sequencing. Here, we develop a novel computational approach for BCR repertoire analysis using established next-generation sequencing methods coupled with network construction and population analysis. BCR sequences organize into networks based on sequence diversity, with differences in network connectivity clearly distinguishing between diverse repertoires of healthy individuals and clonally expanded repertoires from individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other clonal blood disorders. Network population measures defined by the Gini Index and cluster sizes quantify the BCR clonality status and are robust to sampling and sequencing depths. BCR network analysis therefore allows the direct and quantifiable comparison of BCR repertoires between samples and intra-individual population changes between temporal or spatially separated samples and over the course of therapy.","['Bashford-Rogers, Rachael J M', 'Palser, Anne L', 'Huntly, Brian J', 'Rance, Richard', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Follows, George A', 'Kellam, Paul']","['Bashford-Rogers RJ', 'Palser AL', 'Huntly BJ', 'Rance R', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Follows GA', 'Kellam P']","['Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['079249/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '095663/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '100140/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Computational Biology', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Young Adult']",PMC3814887,,2013/06/08 06:00,2014/05/23 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.154815.113 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.154815.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2013 Nov;23(11):1874-84. doi: 10.1101/gr.154815.113.

METHODS: The study was performed between January 2011 and January 2012 at Karadeniz Technical University, Turkey. For neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies, the day before the onset of fever and the first day of the febrile neutropenia attack were taken as days 0 and 1, respectively. Blood samples were obtained from patients with hematologic malignancies on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7. Sixty-eight healthy volunteers were enrolled as the control group. suPAR levels were determined using an ELISA kit following the manufacturer's protocols. Twenty-six male and 14 female patients with hematologic malignancies, the majority with acute/myeloid/lymphocytic leukemia, aged 19-78 years (mean 46.8 years), were included. Fifty febrile neutropenic attacks were investigated in these patients. RESULTS: The mean serum levels of the controls and suPAR 0 were 3.9 +/- 1.5 ng/ml and 5.8 +/- 2.7 ng/ml, respectively. Serum levels of suPAR rose earlier than levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. Serum suPAR levels increased in patients with hematologic malignancies and were found to represent an important serum biomarker for the early prediction of neutropenic fever. A decrease in serum suPAR levels was found to be correlated with treatment response due to antibiotics in this patient group. There were significant differences in suPAR 1 levels between patients with documented infection and those with fever of unknown origin in favor of the former. When the suPAR 1 results were analyzed using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve method, the optimum diagnostic cut-off point was 5.87 ng/ml, the area underneath the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.68-0.91), sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 69%, negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%, and positive predictive value (PPV) was 70%. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that suPAR is an important biomarker that can predict infections in the early stage of febrile neutropenia with high sensitivity and NPV for patients with hematologic malignancies. It is also advantageous since it shows the response to treatment with antibiotherapy in the early stage.","['Kaya, Selcuk', 'Koksal, Iftihar', 'Mentese, Ahmet', 'Sonmez, Mehmet', 'Sumer, Aysegul', 'Yildirim, Seval Sonmez', 'Yilmaz, Gurdal']","['Kaya S', 'Koksal I', 'Mentese A', 'Sonmez M', 'Sumer A', 'Yildirim SS', 'Yilmaz G']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, School of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, 61080, Trabzon, Turkey.

Persistent infections with these viruses have been recognized to cause some types of cancer. These viruses have been implicated in the modulation of various biological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The study of infections caused by oncogenic viruses had helped in our understanding of several mechanisms that regulate cell growth, as well as the molecular alterations leading to cancer. Therefore, transforming viruses provide models of study that have enabled the advances in cancer research. Viruses with transforming abilities, include different members of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) family, Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human T-cell Leukemia virus (HTLV-1), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV).Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a tightly regulated process that plays an important role in development and homeostasis. Additionally, it functions as an antiviral defense mechanism. The deregulation of apoptosis has been implicated in the etiology of diverse diseases, including cancer. Oncogenic viruses employ different mechanisms to inhibit the apoptotic process, allowing the propagation of infected and damaged cells. During this process, some viral proteins are able to evade the immune system, while others can directly interact with the caspases involved in apoptotic signaling. In some instances, viral proteins can also promote apoptosis, which may be necessary for an accurate regulation of the initial stages of infection.","['Fuentes-Gonzalez, Alma Mariana', 'Contreras-Paredes, Adriana', 'Manzo-Merino, Joaquin', 'Lizano, Marcela']","['Fuentes-Gonzalez AM', 'Contreras-Paredes A', 'Manzo-Merino J', 'Lizano M']","['Unidad de Investigacion Biomedica en Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Mexico/Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Av.

Here we examined the interactions between the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin and idarubicin (IDA) in a series of human T-ALL cell lines Molt-4, Jurkat, CCRF-CEM and CEM/C1. Co-exposure of cells to rapamycin and IDA synergistically induced T-ALL cell growth inhibition and apoptosis mediated by caspase activation via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and extrinsic pathway. Combined treatment with rapamycin and IDA down-regulated Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and inhibited the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK). They also played synergistic pro-apoptotic roles in the drug-resistant microenvironment simulated by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a feeder layer. In addition, MSCs protected T-ALL cells from IDA cytotoxicity by up-regulating ERK phosphorylation, while rapamycin efficiently reversed this protective effect. Taken together, we confirm the synergistic antitumor effects of rapamycin and IDA, and provide an insight into the potential future clinical applications of combined rapamycin-IDA regimens for treating T-cell malignancies.","['Wu, Kang-Ni', 'Zhao, Yan-Min', 'He, Ying', 'Wang, Bin-Sheng', 'Du, Kai-Li', 'Fu, Shan', 'Hu, Kai-Min', 'Zhang, Li-Fei', 'Liu, Li-Zhen', 'Hu, Yong-Xian', 'Wang, Ying-Jia', 'Huang, He']","['Wu KN', 'Zhao YM', 'He Y', 'Wang BS', 'Du KL', 'Fu S', 'Hu KM', 'Zhang LF', 'Liu LZ', 'Hu YX', 'Wang YJ', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130820,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",,,2013/06/08 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.811579 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Mar;55(3):668-76. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.811579.

It may be a manifestation of a wide variety of disorders, which primarily or secondarily affect the bone marrow. Haematological investigation forms the bedrock in the management of patients with pancytopenia and therefore needs detailed study. The total number of cases studied were 100 over a period of two years in the department of pathology, JSS Hospital, Mysore. Megaloblastic anaemia (33%) was the commonest cause of pancytopenia. Other causes were nutritional anaemia (16%), aplastic anaemia (14%), hypersplenism (10%), sepsis (9%) and leukaemia (5%). Less common causes were alcoholic liver disease, haemolytic anaemia, HIV, dengue, systemic lupus erythematosus, viral hepatitis, disseminated TB and multiple myeloma. Most of the patients were in the age group of 11-30 years with a male:female ratio of 1.6:1.Generalised weakness and fatigue (88%) were the commonest presenting complaints. Haemoglobin level varied from 1-10 g/dl with majorIty (70%) of them in the range of 5.1-10 g/dI. TLC was in the range of 500-4000 cells/cmm. Most (34%) of them had 3100-4000 cells/cmm. Platelet count was in the range of 4000-1,40,000 cells/cmm. Reticulocyte count varied from 0.1%-15% with majority (82%) of them ranging from 0.1%-2%. The bone marrow cellularity was hypocellular in 14%, hypercellular in 75%, and normocellular in 11% of the patients. Pancytopenia is a relatively common entity with inadequate attention in Indian subcontinent. A comprehensive clinical and haematological study of patients with pancytopenia will usually help in the identification of the underlying cause. However in view of wide array of aetiologies, pancytopenia continues to be a diagnostic challenge for haematologists.","['Rangaswamy, M', 'Prabhu', 'Nandini, N M', 'Manjunath, G V']","['Rangaswamy M', 'Prabhu', 'Nandini NM', 'Manjunath GV']","['Department of Pathology, JSS Medical College, Mysore 570015.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,J Indian Med Assoc,Journal of the Indian Medical Association,7505608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/epidemiology', 'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/epidemiology', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/epidemiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersplenism/epidemiology', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/epidemiology/*etiology/*pathology']",,,2013/06/08 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/06/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,"J Indian Med Assoc. 2012 Aug;110(8):560-2, 566.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23741758,,Publisher,,,,,,2013 Apr,,,,"OBJECTIVES: To update the 2006 systematic review of the comparative benefits and harms of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) strategies and non-ESA strategies to manage anemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation for malignancy (excluding myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia), including the impact of alternative thresholds for initiating treatment and optimal duration of therapy. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches were updated in electronic databases (n=3), conference proceedings (n=3), and Food and Drug Administration transcripts. Multiple sources (n=13) were searched for potential gray literature. A primary source for current survival evidence was a recently published individual patient data meta-analysis. In that meta-analysis, patient data were obtained from investigators for studies enrolling more than 50 patients per arm. Because those data constitute the most currently available data for this update, as well as the source for on-study (active treatment) mortality data, we limited inclusion in the current report to studies enrolling more than 50 patients per arm to avoid potential differential endpoint ascertainment in smaller studies. REVIEW METHODS: Title and abstract screening was performed by one or two (to resolve uncertainty) reviewers; potentially included publications were reviewed in full text. Two or three (to resolve disagreements) reviewers assessed trial quality. Results were independently verified and pooled for outcomes of interest. The balance of benefits and harms was examined in a decision model. RESULTS: We evaluated evidence from 5 trials directly comparing darbepoetin with epoetin, 41 trials comparing epoetin with control, and 8 trials comparing darbepoetin with control; 5 trials evaluated early versus late (delay until Hb </=9 to 11 g/dL) treatment. Trials varied according to duration, tumor types, cancer therapy, trial quality, iron supplementation, baseline hemoglobin, ESA dosing frequency (and therefore amount per dose), and dose escalation. ESAs decreased the risk of transfusion (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.64; I(2) = 51%; 38 trials) without evidence of meaningful difference between epoetin and darbepoetin. Thromboembolic event rates were higher in ESA-treated patients (pooled RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.74; I(2) = 0%; 37 trials) without difference between epoetin and darbepoetin. In 14 trials reporting the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue subscale, the most common patient-reported outcome, scores decreased by -0.6 in control arms (95% CI, -6.4 to 5.2; I(2) = 0%) and increased by 2.1 in ESA arms (95% CI, -3.9 to 8.1; I(2) = 0%). There were fewer thromboembolic and on-study mortality adverse events when ESA treatment was delayed until baseline Hb was less than 10 g/dL, in keeping with current treatment practice, but the difference in effect from early treatment was not significant, and the evidence was limited and insufficient for conclusions. No evidence informed optimal duration of therapy. Mortality was increased during the on-study period (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.31; I(2) = 0%; 37 trials). There was one additional death for every 59 treated patients when the control arm on-study mortality was 10 percent and one additional death for every 588 treated patients when the control-arm on-study mortality was 1 percent. A cohort decision model yielded a consistent result-greater loss of life-years when control arm on-study mortality was higher. There was no discernible increase in mortality with ESA use over the longest available followup (pooled HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.10; I(2) = 38%; 44 trials), but many trials did not include an overall survival endpoint and potential time-dependent confounding was not considered. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this update were consistent with the 2006 review. ESAs reduced the need for transfusions and increased the risk of thromboembolism. FACT-Fatigue scores were better with ESA use but the magnitude was less than the minimal clinically important difference. An increase in mortality accompanied the use of ESAs. An important unanswered question is whether dosing practices and overall ESA exposure might influence harms.","['Grant, Mark D', 'Piper, Margaret', 'Bohlius, Julia', 'Tonia, Thomy', 'Robert, Nadege', 'Vats, Vikrant', 'Bonnell, Claudia', 'Ziegler, Kathleen M', 'Aronson, Naomi']","['Grant MD', 'Piper M', 'Bohlius J', 'Tonia T', 'Robert N', 'Vats V', 'Bonnell C', 'Ziegler KM', 'Aronson N']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book']",,Rockville (MD),,,,,,,,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/06/07 06:00,,,['NBK143013 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,20130607,,,['Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US)'],"['Epoetin and Darbepoetin for Managing Anemia in Patients Undergoing Cancer', 'Treatment: Comparative Effectiveness Update']",['2013/06/07 06:00'],,,,,,,,,['AHRQ Comparative Effectiveness Reviews'],,,,,,

METHODS: Patients (n = 104) under 18 years of age with primary malignancies and undergoing chemotherapy were included. Potential risk indicators were analyzed using binary logistic regression with oral mucositis as the outcome. In a subgroup (n = 35), plasma samples at the time of malignancy diagnosis were analyzed for inflammatory cytokines and an antimicrobial protein pro-LL-37 (hCAP18). RESULTS: In the multivariable model, type of malignancy diagnosis was significantly associated with oral mucositis, with highest risk of oral mucositis in patients with acute leukemia compared to those with lymphoma or solid tumors. At the time of malignancy diagnosis, plasma from patients with acute leukemia displayed higher concentrations (P<0.05) of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha and lower levels of pro-LL-37 (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that pretherapeutic high levels of inflammatory cytokines and low levels of pro-LL-37 in plasma might contribute to the high incidence of oral mucositis in patients with acute leukemia. These findings may add to our understanding of the predispositions to oral mucositis in children with malignancies.","['Ye, Ying', 'Carlsson, Goran', 'Agholme, Monica Barr', 'Karlsson-Sjoberg, Jenny', 'Yucel-Lindberg, Tulay', 'Putsep, Katrin', 'Modeer, Thomas']","['Ye Y', 'Carlsson G', 'Agholme MB', 'Karlsson-Sjoberg J', 'Yucel-Lindberg T', 'Putsep K', 'Modeer T']","['Division of Pediatric Dentistry, Department of Dental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden. ying.ye@ki.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130531,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/blood', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inflammation Mediators/*blood', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stomatitis/*blood/*etiology']",PMC3669020,,2013/06/07 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0064918 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-05695 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 31;8(5):e64918. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064918.

The present study has two objectives: to determine whether CALM can sort additional VAMPs, and to investigate whether VAMP sorting contributes to CALM-dependent vesicle size regulation. Using a flow cytometry-based endocytosis efficiency assay, we demonstrate that CALM is also able to sort VAMPs 4 and 7, even though they have sorting signals for other clathrin adaptors. CALM homologues are present in nearly every eukaryote, suggesting that the CALM family may have evolved as adaptors for retrieving all post-Golgi VAMPs from the plasma membrane. Using a knockdown/rescue system, we show that wild-type CALM restores normal VAMP sorting in CALM-depleted cells, but that two non-VAMP-binding mutants do not. However, when we assayed the effect of CALM depletion on coated pit morphology, using a fluorescence microscopy-based assay, we found that the two mutants were as effective as wild-type CALM. Thus, we can uncouple the sorting function of CALM from its structural role.","['Sahlender, Daniela A', 'Kozik, Patrycja', 'Miller, Sharon E', 'Peden, Andrew A', 'Robinson, Margaret S']","['Sahlender DA', 'Kozik P', 'Miller SE', 'Peden AA', 'Robinson MS']","['Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '100140/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G120/952/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '086598/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130531,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (R-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (VAMP4 protein, human)', '0 (VAMP7 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Clathrin/*metabolism', 'Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Endocytosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Protein Sorting Signals', 'Protein Transport', 'R-SNARE Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transport Vesicles/metabolism/ultrastructure']",PMC3669311,,2013/06/07 06:00,2014/02/19 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0064514 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-08367 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 31;8(5):e64514. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064514.

Our current approach to adoptive immunotherapy is based on a second generation CAR (designated CD19RCD28) that signals through a CD28 and CD3-zeta endodomain. T cells are electroporated with DNA plasmids from the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon/transposase system to express this CAR. Stable integrants of genetically modified T cells can then be retrieved when co-cultured with designer artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2 and 21.

We describe the process to manufacture clinical grade CD19-specific T cells derived from healthy donors.

This study examined the antiproliferative effects and apoptotic activity of hot water extract of S. officinalis L. (HESO) on HSC4 and HN22 human oral cancer cells. The effects of HESO were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-20yl)-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetra zolium (MTS) assay, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and western blot analysis. HESO was found to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in HSC4 and HN22 oral cancer cells. HESO downregulated myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in HSC4 cells and was associated with the activation of Bak, resulting in Bak oligomerization on the mitochondrial outer membrane. HESO did not alter Mcl-1 expression in HN22 cells, but it decreased Sp1 expression. The downregulation of Sp1 by HESO in HN22 cells resulted in a decrease in survivin, a downstream target protein of Sp1. These results suggested that HESO inhibited the growth of oral cancer through either Mcl-1 or Sp1, indicating that HESO may serve as a potential drug candidate against oral cancer.","['Shin, Ji-Ae', 'Kim, Jun-Sung', 'Kwon, Ki-Han', 'Nam, Jeong-Seok', 'Jung, Ji-Youn', 'Cho, Nam-Pyo', 'Cho, Sung-Dae']","['Shin JA', 'Kim JS', 'Kwon KH', 'Nam JS', 'Jung JY', 'Cho NP', 'Cho SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120608,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC3673655,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/06/07 06:01,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2012.748 [doi]', 'ol-04-03-0489 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2012 Sep;4(3):489-494. doi: 10.3892/ol.2012.748.

In addition, these agents have immunomodulatory effects that are under investigation in the allogeneic stem cell transplantation scenario. Both drugs have been used in the perioperative period of allogeneic transplantations with varying degrees of success. It has been hypothesized that low dose azacitidine may increase the graft-versus-leukemia effect and have a role in the maintenance of remission after allogeneic transplantation for myeloid leukemias. It is also intriguing that this favorable effect might occur while mitigating graft-versus-host disease.

These, in turn, have divergent actions on the neoplastic process. Populations of T cells have different roles in the neoplastic environment; while interferon-gamma positive T cells have antitumor activity, the FoxP3+interleukin-10 positive population present a pro-tumor activity. Simultaneously, the inflammatory process promotes the mobilization of fatty acids from the cell membrane to produce lipid mediators, which also participate of the inflammatory response. Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) omega-3 fatty acids, when incorporated in the plasmatic membrane, decrease the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and the production of eicosanoids derived from it. Thus, an alternative family of lipid mediators are produced that are often less inflammatory than those produced from arachidonic acid. Fatty acids can also influence the production of peptide mediators such as cytokines, and the expression of transcription factors, which can determine the production patterns of eicosanoids and cytokines as well as cell differentiation. Due to these properties, the objective of this literature review was to investigate studies published over the last 15 years on the effects of using omega-3 fatty acids on inflammatory markers in leukemia and lymphomas.","['Betiati, Dayanne da Silva Borges', 'de Oliveira, Paula Fernanda', 'Camargo, Carolina de Quadros', 'Nunes, Everson Araujo', 'Trindade, Erasmo Benicio Santos de Moraes']","['Betiati Dda S', 'de Oliveira PF', 'Camargo Cde Q', 'Nunes EA', 'Trindade EB']","['Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina - UFSC, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,,PMC3672122,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/06/07 06:01,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20130033 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2013;35(2):119-25. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20130033.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Docosahexaenoic acids', 'Eicosapentaenoic acid', 'Fatty acids, omega-3', 'Hematologic neoplasms', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Tumor markers, biological']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A simple and sensitive method to quantify imatinib and its metabolite (CGP74588) in human serum was developed and fully validated in order to monitor treatment compliance. METHODS: The method used to quantify these compounds in serum included protein precipitation extraction followed by instrumental analysis using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The method was validated for several parameters, including selectivity, precision, accuracy, recovery and linearity. RESULTS: The parameters evaluated during the validation stage exhibited satisfactory results based on the Food and Drug Administration and the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) guidelines for validating bioanalytical methods. These parameters also showed a linear correlation greater than 0.99 for the concentration range between 0.500 microg/mL and 10.0 microg/mL and a total analysis time of 13 minutes per sample. This study includes results (imatinib serum concentrations) for 308 samples from patients being treated with imatinib mesylate. CONCLUSION: The method developed in this study was successfully validated and is being efficiently used to measure imatinib concentrations in samples from chronic myeloid leukemia patients to check treatment compliance. The imatinib serum levels of patients achieving a major molecular response were significantly higher than those of patients who did not achieve this result. These results are thus consistent with published reports concerning other populations.","['Rezende, Vinicius Marcondes', 'Rivellis, Ariane Julio', 'Gomes, Melissa Medrano', 'Dorr, Felipe Augusto', 'Novaes, Mafalda Megumi Yoshinaga', 'Nardinelli, Luciana', 'Costa, Ariel Lais de Lima', 'Chamone, Dalton de Alencar Fisher', 'Bendit, Israel']","['Rezende VM', 'Rivellis AJ', 'Gomes MM', 'Dorr FA', 'Novaes MM', 'Nardinelli L', 'Costa AL', 'Chamone DA', 'Bendit I']","['Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,,PMC3672119,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/06/07 06:01,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20130030 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2013;35(2):103-8. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20130030.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antineoplastic agents/administration & dosage', 'Chromatography, high pressure liquid', 'Leukemia, myelogenous, chronic, BCR-ABL positive', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this rearrangement involves 2 well-characterized transcription factors, TEL and AML1, the molecular pathways affected by the result of the translocation remain largely unknown. Also in light of recent studies showing genetic and functional heterogeneities in cells responsible for cancer clone maintenance and propagation, targeting a single common deregulated pathway may be critical for the success of novel therapies. Here we describe a novel signaling pathway that is essential for oncogenic addiction in TEL-AML1 leukemia. Our data indicate a direct role for TEL-AML1, via increasing the activity of RAC1, in regulating the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which results in transcriptional induction of MYC. We demonstrate that human leukemic cell lines carrying this translocation are highly sensitive to treatment with S3I-201, a specific STAT3 inhibitor, and, more interestingly, that primary human leukemic samples are also responsive to the drug in the same concentration range. Thus, STAT3 inhibition represents a promising possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of TEL-AML1 leukemia.","['Mangolini, Maurizio', 'de Boer, Jasper', 'Walf-Vorderwulbecke, Vanessa', 'Pieters, Rob', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Williams, Owen']","['Mangolini M', 'de Boer J', 'Walf-Vorderwulbecke V', 'Pieters R', 'den Boer ML', 'Williams O']","['Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130605,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogenes/genetics/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic/physiology']",,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57181-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-465252 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jul 25;122(4):542-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-465252.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is highly expressed in MSCs, but its role in the BM stroma is unknown. Therefore, we knocked down (KD) CTGF expression in human BM-derived MSCs by CTGF short hairpin RNA. CTGF KD MSCs exhibited fivefold lower proliferation compared with control MSCs and had markedly fewer S-phase cells. CTGF KD MSCs differentiated into adipocytes at a sixfold higher rate than controls in vitro and in vivo. To study the effect of CTGF on engraftment of leukemia cells into BM, an in vivo model of humanized extramedullary BM (EXM-BM) was developed in NOD/SCID/IL-2rg(null) mice. Transplanted Nalm-6 or Molm-13 human leukemia cells engrafted at a threefold higher rate in adipocyte-rich CTGF KD MSC-derived EXM-BM than in control EXM-BM. Leptin was found to be highly expressed in CTGF KD EXM-BM and in BM samples of patients with acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whereas it was not expressed in normal controls. Given the established role of the leptin receptor in leukemia cells, the data suggest an important role of CTGF in MSC differentiation into adipocytes and of leptin in homing and progression of leukemia.","['Battula, V Lokesh', 'Chen, Ye', 'Cabreira, Maria da Graca', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Wang, Zhiqiang', 'Ma, Wencai', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'Shpall, Elizabeth', 'Lyons, Karen', 'Strunk, Dirk', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Davis, Richard Eric', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Battula VL', 'Chen Y', 'Cabreira Mda G', 'Ruvolo V', 'Wang Z', 'Ma W', 'Konoplev S', 'Shpall E', 'Lyons K', 'Strunk D', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Davis RE', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA153019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA044164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 FD003733/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA143805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA153019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130605,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Leptin)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Connective Tissue Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leptin/metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology']",PMC3716201,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56065-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-437988 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jul 18;122(3):357-66. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-437988.

RNA-Seq is a novel tool to comprehensively assess such associations. We interrogated RNA-Seq data from 3,775 malignant neoplasms in The Cancer Genome Atlas database for the presence of viral sequences. Viral integration sites were also detected in expressed transcripts using a novel approach. The detection capacity of RNA-Seq was compared to available clinical laboratory data. Human papillomavirus (HPV) transcripts were detected using RNA-Seq analysis in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Detection of HPV by RNA-Seq correlated with detection by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the head and neck. Hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were detected using RNA-Seq in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma tumors, respectively. Integration sites of viral genes and oncogenes were detected in cancers harboring HPV or hepatitis B virus but not in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma. Integration sites of expressed viral transcripts frequently involved known coding areas of the host genome. No DNA virus transcripts were detected in acute myeloid leukemia, cutaneous melanoma, low- and high-grade gliomas of the brain, and adenocarcinomas of the breast, colon and rectum, lung, prostate, ovary, kidney, and thyroid. In conclusion, this study provides a large-scale overview of the landscape of DNA viruses in human malignant cancers. While further validation is necessary for specific cancer types, our findings highlight the utility of RNA-Seq in detecting tumor-associated DNA viruses and identifying viral integration sites that may unravel novel mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis.","['Khoury, Joseph D', 'Tannir, Nizar M', 'Williams, Michelle D', 'Chen, Yunxin', 'Yao, Hui', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Thompson, Erika J', 'Meric-Bernstam, Funda', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Weinstein, John N', 'Su, Xiaoping']","['Khoury JD', 'Tannir NM', 'Williams MD', 'Chen Y', 'Yao H', 'Zhang J', 'Thompson EJ', 'Meric-Bernstam F', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Weinstein JN', 'Su X']","['Department of Hematopathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. jkhoury@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24CA143883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000371/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR000371/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA143883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130605,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['DNA Viruses/*isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*virology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3754044,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00340-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00340-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Aug;87(16):8916-26. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00340-13.

Immune-evasion molecules targeting the phagocyte receptors for these opsonins have not been described. In this study, we demonstrate that S. aureus escapes from FcgammaR-mediated immunity by secreting a potent FcgammaR antagonist, FLIPr, or its homolog FLIPr-like. Both proteins were previously reported to function as formyl peptide receptor inhibitors. Binding of FLIPr was mainly restricted to FcgammaRII receptors, whereas FLIPr-like bound to different FcgammaR subclasses, and both competitively blocked IgG-ligand binding. They fully inhibited FcgammaR-mediated effector functions, including opsonophagocytosis and subsequent intracellular killing of S. aureus by neutrophils and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumor cells by both neutrophils and NK cells. In vivo, treatment of mice with FLIPr-like prevented the development of an immune complex-mediated FcgammaR-dependent Arthus reaction.

The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical significance of FLT3 (CD135) and c-KIT (CD117) coexpression on myeloblasts in AML. METHODS: Using flow-cytometry, we prospectively observed in 115 AML patients that CD135, CD117, and CD135+CD117 coexpression was expressed in 95 (82%), 104 (90%), and 81 (70%) patients respectively. Median expression of CD135, CD117, and their co expression was used as cut off for high and low expression. RESULTS: FLT3 ITD (internal tandem duplication) was present in 20 (17%) patients. High coexpression did not correlate with FLT3 ITD (P = 0.432) and cytogenetics (P = 0.244). Out of 115 patients, 86 (74.7%) achieved remission. At median followup of 15.5 months, EFS and OS was 29% and 35%, respectively for the entire cohort. Patients with high coexpression of CD135 and CD117 in comparison to those with low coexpression had significantly inferior EFS (20% vs 38% P < 0.001) and OS (27% vs 44% P = 0.001). In step wise Cox regression multivariable analysis, hazard ratio for high hemoglobin, WBC count, and coexpression of CD135 and CD117 was 0.63, 1.73, and 2.46 respectively for EFS, and for OS only CD135+CD117 coexpression emerged as an independent predictor (hazard ratio 2.25). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that high coexpression of CD135+CD117 is an independent predictor of poor outcome in AML and is easily measurable by routine diagnostic flow-cytometry.","['Sharawat, Surender Kumar', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Raina, Vinod', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Sharma, Atul', 'Iqbal, Sobuhi', 'Bakhshi, Radhika', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Sharawat SK', 'Gupta R', 'Raina V', 'Kumar L', 'Sharma A', 'Iqbal S', 'Bakhshi R', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Delhi; Dr. B.

However, not all tumor cells are sensitive to TRAIL, highlighting the need for strategies to overcome TRAIL resistance. Inhibitor of apoptosis family member survivin is constitutively activated in various cancers and blocks apoptotic signaling. Recently, we demonstrated that YM-155 [3-(2-methoxyethyl)-2-methyl-4,9-dioxo-1-(pyrazin-2-ylmethyl)-4,9-dihydro-3H-naph tho[2,3-d]imidazol-1-ium bromide], a small molecule inhibitor, downregulates not only survivin in gliomas but also myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), and it upregulates proapoptotic Noxa levels. Because Mcl-1 and survivin are critical mediators of resistance to various anticancer therapies, we questioned whether YM-155 could sensitize resistant glioma cells to TRAIL. To address this hypothesis, we combined YM-155 with TRAIL and examined the effects on cell survival and apoptotic signaling. TRAIL or YM-155 individually induced minimal killing in highly resistant U373 and LNZ308 cell lines, but combining TRAIL with YM-155 triggered a synergistic proapoptotic response, mediated through mitochondrial dysfunction via activation of caspases-8, -9, -7, -3, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, and Bid. Apoptosis induced by combination treatments was blocked by caspase-8 and pan-caspase inhibitors. In addition, knockdown of Mcl-1 by RNA interference overcame apoptotic resistance to TRAIL. Conversely, silencing Noxa by RNA interference reduced the combined effects of YM-155 and TRAIL on apoptosis. Mechanistically, these findings indicate that YM-155 plays a role in counteracting glioma cell resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by downregulating Mcl-1 and survivin and amplifying mitochondrial signaling through intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The significantly enhanced antitumor activity of the combination of YM-155 and TRAIL may have applications for therapy of malignant glioma.","['Premkumar, Daniel R', 'Jane, Esther P', 'Foster, Kimberly A', 'Pollack, Ian F']","['Premkumar DR', 'Jane EP', 'Foster KA', 'Pollack IF']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 NS040923/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01NS40923/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130605,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (YM 155)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glioma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3716309,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.113.204743 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.113.204743 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2013 Aug;346(2):201-10. doi: 10.1124/jpet.113.204743.

Therefore, we have analyzed the influence of the methylation status prior to AZA treatment on the overall survival and clinical response of myeloid malignancies. DNA methylation status of 24 tumor suppressor genes was analyzed by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in 63 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia treated with azacytidine. Most patients (73 %) showed methylation of at least one gene, but only 12 % of patients displayed >/=3 methylated genes. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of a high number (>/=2) of methylated genes (P = 0.022), a high WBC count (P = 0.033), or anemia (P = 0.029) were independent prognostic factors associated with shorter overall survival. The aberrant methylation status did not correlate with the response to AZA, although four of the five patients with >/=3 methylated genes did not respond. By contrast, favorable cytogenetics independently influenced the clinical response to AZA as 64.7 % of patients with good-risk cytogenetic abnormalities responded (P = 0.03). Aberrant methylation status influences the survival of patients treated with AZA, being shorter in those patients with a high number of methylated genes.","['Abaigar, Maria', 'Ramos, Fernando', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Diez-Campelo, Maria', 'Sanchez-del-Real, Javier', 'Hermosin, Lourdes', 'Rodriguez, Juan Nicolas', 'Aguilar, Carlos', 'Recio, Isabel', 'Alonso, Jose Maria', 'de las Heras, Natalia', 'Megido, Marta', 'Fuertes, Marta', 'del Canizo, Maria Consuelo', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria']","['Abaigar M', 'Ramos F', 'Benito R', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Sanchez-del-Real J', 'Hermosin L', 'Rodriguez JN', 'Aguilar C', 'Recio I', 'Alonso JM', 'de las Heras N', 'Megido M', 'Fuertes M', 'del Canizo MC', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['Cancer Research Center-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1799-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Nov;92(11):1543-52. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1799-9.

For most cells, the number of possible cell divisions is limited because of various biological constraints, such as progressive telomere shortening, cell senescence cascades or a hierarchically organized tissue structure. Thus, the risk of accumulating cells carrying multiple mutations is low. Nonetheless, many diseases are based on the accumulation of such multiple mutations. We model a general, hierarchically organized tissue by a multi-compartment approach, allowing any number of mutations within a cell. We derive closed solutions for the deterministic clonal dynamics and the reproductive capacity of single clones. Our results hold for the average dynamics in a hierarchical tissue characterized by an arbitrary combination of proliferation parameters. We show that hierarchically organized tissues strongly suppress cells carrying multiple mutations and derive closed solutions for the expected size and diversity of clonal populations founded by a single mutant within the hierarchy. We discuss the example of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in detail and find good agreement between our predicted results and recently observed clonal diversities in patients. This result can contribute to the explanation of very diverse mutation profiles observed by whole genome sequencing of many different cancers.","['Werner, Benjamin', 'Dingli, David', 'Traulsen, Arne']","['Werner B', 'Dingli D', 'Traulsen A']","['Evolutionary Theory Group, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plon, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130605,England,J R Soc Interface,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",101217269,,IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Telomere Shortening/*genetics']",PMC4043170,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['rsif.2013.0349 [pii]', '10.1098/rsif.2013.0349 [doi]']",epublish,J R Soc Interface. 2013 Jun 5;10(85):20130349. doi: 10.1098/rsif.2013.0349.

Because of the widespread and increasing use of gasoline by consumers and the high exposure potential of occupational cohorts, a thorough understanding of this issue is important. The current study utilizes an evidence-based approach to examine whether or not the available epidemiologic studies demonstrate a strong and consistent association between occupational exposure to gasoline and lymphatic/hematopoietic cancers. Among 67 epidemiologic studies initially identified, 54 were ranked according to specific criteria relating to the relevance and robustness of each study for answering the research question. The 30 highest-ranked studies were sorted into three tiers of evidence and were analyzed for strength, specificity, consistency, temporality, dose-response trends and coherence. Meta statistics were also calculated for each general and specific lymphatic/hematopoietic cancer category with adequate data. The evidence-based analysis did not confirm any strong and consistent association between occupational exposure to gasoline and lymphatic/hematopoietic cancers based on the epidemiologic studies available to date. These epidemiologic findings, combined with the evidence showing relatively low occupational benzene vapor exposures associated with gasoline formulations during the last three decades, suggest that current motor gasoline formulations are not associated with increased lymphatic/hematopoietic cancer risks related to benzene.","['Keenan, J J', 'Gaffney, S', 'Gross, S A', 'Ronk, C J', 'Paustenbach, D J', 'Galbraith, D', 'Kerger, B D']","['Keenan JJ', 'Gaffney S', 'Gross SA', 'Ronk CJ', 'Paustenbach DJ', 'Galbraith D', 'Kerger BD']","['1ChemRisk, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130605,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,['0 (Gasoline)'],IM,"['Gasoline/*toxicity', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Volatilization']",,,2013/06/07 06:00,2014/05/28 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0960327113476909 [pii]', '10.1177/0960327113476909 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2013 Oct;32(10):1007-27. doi: 10.1177/0960327113476909.

A total of 240 newborn rats were randomly divided into a normoxia control (N) group, a hyperoxia (H) group and a H + FSD (HF) group. The rats were sacrificed, and the eyes were enucleated from postnatal day (P)12 to P21. Samples were prepared for retinal flat mounts, mRNA and protein quantification. On P14, a higher number of circuitous retinal veins was observed in the H group compared with the HF group. In the HF group, the avascular area was significantly reduced compared with the H group on P18 (P<0.01). In the HF group, the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 was significantly increased on P15 compared with the N and H group (P<0.01). On P15 and P17 in the H group and on P13 in the HF group, the mRNA expression of ICAM1 was significantly increased compared with the other groups (P<0.05). In the H and HF group, the expression of HIF-1alpha was significantly increased on P12 compared with the N group (P<0.05). On P19 and P21, HIF-1alpha expression was significantly increased to a maximum level in the HF group compared with the H and N group (P<0.01). In conclusion, these results suggest that FSD inhibits the expression of ICAM-1, assisting in the release of Bcl-2, suppressing caspase-3. In the HF group, the retinal flat mounts revealed that FSD had a vasorelaxant effect. On P18, a double-layered retinal vascular network was formed, and the number of non-perfused regions was significantly reduced. However, the late-phase peak expression of HIF-1alpha resulted in an inevitable increase in vascular endothelial growth factor expression and further accelerated neovascularization and vascular reconstruction in the immature retinal model.","['Wang, Haiying', 'Chen, Xiaolong']","['Wang H', 'Chen X']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, The Fourth People's Hospital of Shenyang, Shenyang, Liaoning 110031, P.R.

However formalin fixation results in chemical modification of RNA and increased RNA degradation. This can affect RNA yield and quality. A critical step when analysing gene expression is the conversion of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) using a reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. FFPE derived RNA may affect the performance and efficiency of the RT enzyme and cDNA synthesis. We directly compared three commonly used FFPE RNA isolation methods and measured RNA yield, purity and integrity. We also assessed the effectiveness of three commercially available Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) RTs on cDNA synthesis and gene expression sensitivity when using FFPE RNA as a template. Our results show that gene detection sensitivity is dependent on the isolation method, RT and length of the PCR amplicon (<200bp) when using FFPE RNA. The use of an M-MLV RT enzyme with reduced RNaseH activity gave significantly increased qRT-PCR sensitivity when using FFPE RNA derived from prostate tissue. The choice of RT can also affect perceived changes in target gene expression and thus the same RT should be used when attempting to reproduce results from different studies. This study highlights the need to optimise and evaluate RNA isolation methods and RTs when using FFPE RNA as a template in order to maximise a successful outcome in PCR applications.","['Hagen, Rachel M', 'Rhodes, Anthony', 'Oxley, Jon', 'Ladomery, Michael R']","['Hagen RM', 'Rhodes A', 'Oxley J', 'Ladomery MR']","['Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK.

At diagnosis, median age was 61 years (51% females); thrombocytosis and venous thrombosis were more frequent in women and arterial thrombosis and abnormal karyotype in men. Considering patients from the center with the most mature follow-up information (n=337 with 44% of patients followed to death), median survival (14.1 years) was significantly worse than that of the age- and sex-matched US population (P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, survival for the entire study cohort (n=1545) was adversely affected by older age, leukocytosis, venous thrombosis and abnormal karyotype; a prognostic model that included the first three parameters delineated risk groups with median survivals of 10.9-27.8 years (hazard ratio (HR), 10.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.7-15.0). Pruritus was identified as a favorable risk factor for survival. Cumulative hazard of leukemic transformation, with death as a competing risk, was 2.3% at 10 years and 5.5% at 15 years; risk factors included older age, abnormal karyotype and leukocytes >/=15 x 10(9)/l. Leukemic transformation was associated with treatment exposure to pipobroman or P32/chlorambucil. We found no association between leukemic transformation and hydroxyurea or busulfan use.","['Tefferi, A', 'Rumi, E', 'Finazzi, G', 'Gisslinger, H', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Randi, M L', 'Vaidya, R', 'Cazzola, M', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Gisslinger, B', 'Pieri, L', 'Ruggeri, M', 'Bertozzi, I', 'Sulai, N H', 'Casetti, I', 'Carobbio, A', 'Jeryczynski, G', 'Larson, D R', 'Mullauer, L', 'Pardanani, A', 'Thiele, J', 'Passamonti, F', 'Barbui, T']","['Tefferi A', 'Rumi E', 'Finazzi G', 'Gisslinger H', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Randi ML', 'Vaidya R', 'Cazzola M', 'Rambaldi A', 'Gisslinger B', 'Pieri L', 'Ruggeri M', 'Bertozzi I', 'Sulai NH', 'Casetti I', 'Carobbio A', 'Jeryczynski G', 'Larson DR', 'Mullauer L', 'Pardanani A', 'Thiele J', 'Passamonti F', 'Barbui T']","['Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130606,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Young Adult']",PMC3768558,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013163 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.163 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Sep;27(9):1874-81. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.163.

The primary histopathologic differential diagnosis for histiocytoid Sweet syndrome includes leukemia cutis and true histiocytic dermatoses. However, it does not usually include a deep mycotic infection. Herein, we describe a case of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome in a 75-year-old man in which histopathologic examination showed a dense dermal infiltrate composed of mature neutrophils and numerous yeast-like mononuclear cells with a surrounding halo, suspicious for cryptococcal organisms. Immunohistochemical and histochemical studies demonstrated expression of myeloperoxidase by the yeast-like forms and an absence of periodic acid-Schiff and mucicarmine staining. Microbiologic culture studies were negative for fungal organisms. The case met all the criteria for Sweet syndrome and, given the cytomorphology of the mononuclear cells with vesicular irregularly rounded nuclei and myeloperoxidase expression, the case was most consistent with histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. The perinuclear haloes in this case most likely represent cytoplasmic vacuolization of the immature, histiocytoid appearing neutrophils secondary to a novel nonapoptotic caspase-independent death pathway. This case highlights the histopathologic similarities that may be present between cryptococcal infection and histiocytoid Sweet syndrome, and the utility of immunohistochemical markers and histochemical staining to differentiate between the two entities.","['Wilson, Thomas C', 'Stone, Mary S', 'Swick, Brian L']","['Wilson TC', 'Stone MS', 'Swick BL']","['Departments of *Pathology, and daggerDermatology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA; double daggerIowa City Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Iowa City, IA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cryptococcosis/*pathology', '*Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cells/*pathology', 'Sweet Syndrome/*pathology']",,,2013/06/07 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/DAD.0b013e31828b811b [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2014 Mar;36(3):264-9. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0b013e31828b811b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed the impact of the frequency of qPCR testing on progression-free survival (PFS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective chart review of 402 CML-CP patients on first line imatinib therapy, performed by 38 community-based US physicians, analyzed the impact of the frequency of molecular monitoring on the risk of progression and PFS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to progression and progression-free survival. RESULTS: Over the 3 year study, 13.2% of patients did not have any qPCR monitoring and 46.3% had 3-4 qPCR tests per year; 5.7% of CML-CP patients progressed to accelerated/blast phase or died. Compared to patients with no qPCR monitoring, those with 3-4 qPCR tests per year had a lower risk of progression (HR = 0.085; p = 0.001) and longer PFS (HR = 0.088; p = 0.001) after adjusting for potential confounders, as did those patients with 1-2 qPCR tests per year (both p < 0.02). Results were consistent after adjusting for Sokal score when available. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to document the clinical impact of frequent molecular monitoring, and the findings underscore the importance of regular molecular monitoring in delivering quality care for CML. These findings could be subject to unobserved confounders.","['Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Chen, Lei', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Macalalad, Alexander R', 'Liu, Nathan', 'Kaminsky, Michael', 'Ericson, Solveig G', 'Wu, Eric Q']","['Goldberg SL', 'Chen L', 'Guerin A', 'Macalalad AR', 'Liu N', 'Kaminsky M', 'Ericson SG', 'Wu EQ']","['John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130621,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage', '*Blast Crisis/blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,2013/06/07 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2013.812034 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2013 Sep;29(9):1075-82. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2013.812034.

On the other hand, persistent CMV infection has recently been shown to decrease tumor relapse and protect against lethal bacterial infection. The influence of persistent CMV on the outcome of an acute retroviral superinfection is still unknown. RESULTS: Here we show that a persistent murine CMV (mCMV) infection surprisingly confers higher resistance to a primary Friend retrovirus infection (FV) of mice. Decreased FV titers and augmented FV-specific CD8 T-cell responses were found in mCMV infected mice during primary FV superinfection. NK cells produced higher amounts of IFNgamma after FV infection of persistently mCMV infected mice suggesting that these cells were involved in the 'protective' effect. Depletion of NK1.1+ cells or neutralization of IFNgamma during FV superinfection abrogated the mCMV-mediated effect. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate for the first time that a persistent CMV infection induces long-lasting NK cell responses that can enhance immunity to primary retroviral infections. To our knowledge, studies investigating primary HIV infection have not analyzed the role of the CMV seropositivity in these patients. Our observations suggest that NK cells in CMV seropositive individuals might contribute to the control of primary HIV infection.","['Francois, Sandra', 'Peng, Jing', 'Schwarz, Tatjana', 'Duppach, Janine', 'Gibbert, Kathrin', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Kraft, Anke Rm']","['Francois S', 'Peng J', 'Schwarz T', 'Duppach J', 'Gibbert K', 'Dittmer U', 'Kraft AR']","['Institute for Virology of the University Hospital in Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. kraft.anke@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130605,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Animals', 'Coinfection/immunology/virology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Resistance', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Muromegalovirus/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology/virology']",PMC3744174,,2013/06/07 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-58 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-58 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Jun 5;10:58. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-58.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ESR studies provided evidence that copious free radicals can be generated from these N-H, N-S, and S-O containing compounds upon photoirradiation with UV/visible light. The analyses of spectral data allowed us to identify the free radical species. The cell viability studies showed that these agents after exposure to light exert cytotoxicity to kill cancer cells (U937 leukemia cell lines HTC11, KB, and HT29 cell lines) in a dosage- and time-dependent manner. We examined a possible pathway of cell death via DNA degradation by a plasmid cleavage assay for several compounds. The effects of photosensitization with benzophenone in the presence of oxygen were examined. The studies indicate that planar tricyclic amines and sulfenamides tend to form pi-electron delocalized aminyl radicals, whereas nonplanar ones tend to yield nitroxide radicals resulting from the recombination of aminyl radicals with oxygen. The ESR studies coupled with the results of cell viability measurements and DNA degradation reveal that planar N-centered radicals can provide higher potency in cell death and allow us to provide some insights on the reaction mechanisms. We also found the formation of azatropylium cations possessing high aromaticity derived from azepines can facilitate secondary electron transfer to form toxic O2(*-) radicals, which can further exert oxidative stress and cause cell death.","['Lin, Tien-Sung', 'Rajagopalan, Raghavan', 'Shen, Yuefei', 'Park, Sungho', 'Poreddy, Amruta R', 'Asmelash, Bethel', 'Karwa, Amolkumar S', 'Taylor, John-Stephen A']","['Lin TS', 'Rajagopalan R', 'Shen Y', 'Park S', 'Poreddy AR', 'Asmelash B', 'Karwa AS', 'Taylor JS']","['Department of Chemistry, Washington University , St. Louis, Missouri 63130, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130624,United States,J Phys Chem A,The journal of physical chemistry.

This phase II study assessed the efficacy of alemtuzumab combined with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to boost antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity mediated by neutrophils. Twelve patients with relapsed (n = 11) or refractory (n = 1) ALL, including four relapses postallogeneic stem cell transplantation, were treated and monitored between October 2006 and January 2011. Patients received 1 wk of alemtuzumab every other day at increasing doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg to test tolerance and 30 mg three times a week for 12-18 infusions. If in complete remission (CR), patients received maintenance therapy for 1 wk, every 2 months. G-CSF was administered at 5 mug/kg per day during alemtuzumab administration. The primary endpoint was disappearance of blast cells on a marrow aspirate. CD52 was expressed in all patients. Four patients reached CR. In one additional patient, clearance of blast cells was observed in peripheral blood but not in the marrow. The most frequent adverse events during course 1 of treatment were fever and chills (n = 3), skin rash (n = 3), and bronchospasm (n = 2). Tumor lysis syndrome was observed at treatment initiation in one patient who reached CR. All patients progressed within a few months and all but one died. The surviving patient is still alive after relapse and a second allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Fourteen patients were treated with bortezomib 1.5 mg/m(2) administered twice weekly for two weeks, every 3 weeks. Median age was 70 years (range 60-81) and the median number of cycles delivered was 2 (range 1-4). Of 13 evaluable patients, in 8 (61%), the administration of bortezomib resulted in an antileukemic effect as demonstrated by peripheral blood and/or bone marrow blast reduction. In 4 (50%) of these 8, a decrease by 37% of transfusion requirement was also observed (P = 0.009). Overall median survival was 4 months (range 0.25-10). Neurotoxicity was the most frequent adverse event with 7 of 13 (54%) patients experiencing grades 3-4 peripheral neuropathy. Neurotoxicity led to treatment discontinuation in 4 (57%) of 7. In conclusion, the observed anti-leukemic activity of bortezomib indicates that there is room for designing additional studies in which combination with other chemotherapeutic agents should be considered.

The eukaryotic expression vector expressing the hsa-miR-203 plasmid (PmiR-203) was transfected into K562 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. bcr/abl 3' untranslated region (UTR) and bcr/abl mutated 3'UTR dual luciferase report vectors (psi-CHECK-2) were used to validate the regulation of bcr/abl by miR-203. The inhibitory effects of ATO and PmiR-203, used singly or in combination, on cell proliferation were detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis of the K562 cells was detected by flow cytometry using double-staining with Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). The activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were detected by a colorimetric method and the cytochrome c protein levels were detected by western blotting. When used in combination with PmiR-203, the IC50 of ATO was reduced from 6.49 to 2.45 mug/ml and the sensitivity of cells to ATO increased 2.64-fold. In addition, PmiR-203 and ATO caused growth inhibition, apoptosis and G1-phase arrest in K562 cells. Furthermore, PmiR-203 significantly promoted ATO-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis, affecting the G1 phase. JC-1 fluorescent staining revealed that the membrane potential of the mitochondria had changed. The activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 increased, the expression levels of cytochrome c were upregulated and the expression level of bcr/abl mRNA was significantly suppressed. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter vector, containing tandem miR-203 binding sites from the bcr/abl 3'UTR, demonstrated that bcr/abl was directly regulated by miR-203. PmiR-203 sensitized K562 leukemia cells to ATO by inducing apoptosis and downregulating bcr/ abl gene levels. The induction of apoptosis may occur through the mitochondrial pathway. The combination of ATO and PmiR-203 presents therapeutic potential for chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['He, Jin-Hua', 'Li, Yu-Min', 'Li, Yu-Guang', 'Xie, Xing-Yi', 'Wang, Li', 'Chun, Shun-Yi', 'Cheng, Wu-Jia']","['He JH', 'Li YM', 'Li YG', 'Xie XY', 'Wang L', 'Chun SY', 'Cheng WJ']","['Department of Laboratory, Central Hospital of Panyu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong 511400;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130227,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,PMC3671790,,2013/06/06 06:00,2013/06/06 06:01,['2013/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2013.981 [doi]', 'etm-05-05-1315 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2013 May;5(5):1315-1321. doi: 10.3892/etm.2013.981.

BC is characterized by elevated beta-catenin signaling in granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs), which enables this population to function as leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and act as a reservoir for resistance. Because normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and LSCs depend on beta-catenin signaling for self-renewal, strategies to specifically target BC will require identification of drugable factors capable of distinguishing between self-renewal in BC LSCs and normal HSCs. Here, we show that the MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase (MNK)-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) axis is overexpressed in BC GMPs but not normal HSCs, and that MNK kinase-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation at serine 209 activates beta-catenin signaling in BC GMPs. Mechanistically, eIF4E overexpression and phosphorylation leads to increased beta-catenin protein synthesis, whereas MNK-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation is required for nuclear translocation and activation of beta-catenin. Accordingly, we found that a panel of small molecule MNK kinase inhibitors prevented eIF4E phosphorylation, beta-catenin activation, and BC LSC function in vitro and in vivo. Our findings identify the MNK-eIF4E axis as a specific and critical regulator of BC self-renewal, and suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of the MNK kinases may be therapeutically useful in BC chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Lim, Sharon', 'Saw, Tzuen Yih', 'Zhang, Min', 'Janes, Matthew R', 'Nacro, Kassoum', 'Hill, Jeffrey', 'Lim, An Qi', 'Chang, Chia-Tien', 'Fruman, David A', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Tan, Soo Yong', 'Fan, Hung', 'Chuah, Charles T H', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Lim S', 'Saw TY', 'Zhang M', 'Janes MR', 'Nacro K', 'Hill J', 'Lim AQ', 'Chang CT', 'Fruman DA', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Tan SY', 'Fan H', 'Chuah CT', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School, Singapore 169857.']",['eng'],['T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130604,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (CGP 57380)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MKNK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",PMC3690864,,2013/06/06 06:00,2013/09/05 06:00,['2013/06/06 06:00'],"['2013/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1301838110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1301838110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jun 18;110(25):E2298-307. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1301838110.

Alzheimer is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by accumulation of beta-amyloid (plaques) and hyper-phosphorylated Tau (tangles). Here we show that AD animals have high levels of insoluble parkin and decreased parkin-Beclin-1 interaction, while peripheral administration of TKIs, including Nilotinib and Bosutinib, increases soluble parkin leading to amyloid clearance and cognitive improvement. Blocking Beclin-1 expression with shRNA or parkin deletion prevents tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition-induced amyloid clearance, suggesting that functional parkin-Beclin-1 interaction mediates amyloid degradation. Isolation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in AD mouse brain shows accumulation of parkin and amyloid, consistent with previous results in AD brains, while Bosutinib and Nilotinib increase parkin-Beclin-1 interaction and result in protein deposition in the lysosome. These data suggest that decreased parkin solubility impedes parkin-Beclin-1 interaction and amyloid clearance.

Tumours contain transplantable and hyperproliferative tumour propagating cells, which can be enriched by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Single mutations stimulate stem cells, but tumours are not formed. We show that beta-catenin, CBP and Mll promote self-renewal and H3K4 tri-methylation in tumour propagating cells. Blocking beta-catenin-CBP interaction with the small molecule ICG-001 and small-interfering RNAs against beta-catenin, CBP or Mll abrogate hyperproliferation and H3K4 tri-methylation, and induce differentiation of cultured tumour propagating cells into acini-like structures. ICG-001 decreases H3K4me3 at promoters of stem cell-associated genes in vitro and reduces tumour growth in vivo. Remarkably, high Wnt/beta-catenin and low Bmp signalling also characterize human salivary gland SCC and head and neck SCC in general. Our work defines mechanisms by which beta-catenin signals remodel chromatin and control induction and maintenance of tumour propagating cells. Further, it supports new strategies for the therapy of solid tumours.","['Wend, Peter', 'Fang, Liang', 'Zhu, Qionghua', 'Schipper, Jorg H', 'Loddenkemper, Christoph', 'Kosel, Frauke', 'Brinkmann, Volker', 'Eckert, Klaus', 'Hindersin, Simone', 'Holland, Jane D', 'Lehr, Stephan', 'Kahn, Michael', 'Ziebold, Ulrike', 'Birchmeier, Walter']","['Wend P', 'Fang L', 'Zhu Q', 'Schipper JH', 'Loddenkemper C', 'Kosel F', 'Brinkmann V', 'Eckert K', 'Hindersin S', 'Holland JD', 'Lehr S', 'Kahn M', 'Ziebold U', 'Birchmeier W']","['Max-Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130604,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (ICG 001)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'CREB-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects', 'beta Catenin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC3715856,,2013/06/06 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2013127 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2013.127 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2013 Jul 17;32(14):1977-89. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2013.127.

ASXL proteins consist of ASXN, ASXH, ASXM1, ASXM2 and PHD domains. ASXL1 directly interacts with BAP1, KDM1A (LSD1), NCOA1 and nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), such as retinoic acid receptors, oestrogen receptor and androgen receptor. ASXL family members are epigenetic scaffolding proteins that assemble epigenetic regulators and transcription factors to specific genomic loci with histone modifications. ASXL1 is involved in transcriptional repression through an interaction with PRC2 and also contributes to transcriptional regulation through interactions with BAP1 and/or NHR complexes. Germ-line mutations of human ASXL1 and ASXL3 occur in Bohring-Opitz and related syndromes. Amplification and overexpression of ASXL1 occur in cervical cancer. Truncation mutations of ASXL1 occur in colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), malignant myeloid diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and liver, prostate and breast cancers; those of ASXL2 occur in prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer and those of ASXL3 are observed in melanoma. EPC1-ASXL2 gene fusion occurs in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma. The prognosis of myeloid malignancies with misregulating truncation mutations of ASXL1 is poor. ASXL family members are assumed to be tumour suppressive or oncogenic in a context-dependent manner.","['Katoh, M']",['Katoh M'],"['Division of Integrative Omics and Bioinformatics, National Cancer Centre, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo Ward, Tokyo, Japan. mkatoh-kkr@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130604,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (ASXL2 protein, human)', '0 (ASXL3 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Repressor Proteins/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology', 'Transcription Factors/classification/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3721406,,2013/06/06 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013281 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.281 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 Jul 23;109(2):299-306. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.281.

We translated these biological insights into clinical practice to improve diagnostic work-ups and patient management. Combined interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (CI-FISH), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and gene expression profiles (GEP) were applied in 51 children with T-ALL who were stratified according to minimal residual disease (MRD) risk categories (AIEOP-BFM ALL2000). CI-FISH identified type A abnormalities in 90% of patients. Distribution of each was in line with the estimated incidence in childhood T-ALL: 37.5% TAL/LMO, 22.5% HOXA, 20% TLX3, 7.5% TLX1, and 2.5% NKX2-1. GEP predictions concurred. SNP detected type B abnormalities in all cases, thus linking type A and B lesions. This approach provided an accurate, comprehensive genomic diagnosis and a complementary GEP-based classification of T-ALL in children. Dissecting primary and secondary lesions within MRD categories could improve prognostic criteria for the majority of patients and be a step towards personalized diagnosis.","['La Starza, Roberta', 'Lettieri, Antonella', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Nofrini, Valeria', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Songia, Simona', 'Crescenzi, Barbara', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Giordan, Marco', 'Leszl, Anna', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['La Starza R', 'Lettieri A', 'Pierini V', 'Nofrini V', 'Gorello P', 'Songia S', 'Crescenzi B', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Giordan M', 'Leszl A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Aversa F', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'Conter V', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Mecucci C']","['Hematology Unit, University of Perugia, Polo Unico S.M.

The leukemic cells harbored a novel apparent 3-way translocation t(6;19;11)(p22.2;p13.1;q23.3). We utilized advanced molecular cytogenetic methods including 24-color karyotyping, high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and DNA sequencing to characterize the genomic complement in the leukemic cells from aspirated bone marrow cells at AML diagnosis.

Retrospective fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed presence of the MLL-involving rearrangement in the initial stages of disease before clear morphological signs of bone marrow involvement. The patient responded well to therapy and remains in remission>6 years from diagnosis. This apparent 3-way translocation is remarkable because of its rarity and presentation with myeloid sarcoma, and may, as more cases are characterized, further our understanding onto how such complex translocations contribute to promote leukemogenesis and respond to therapy.","['Tuborgh, A', 'Meyer, C', 'Marschalek, R', 'Preiss, B', 'Hasle, H', 'Kjeldsen, E']","['Tuborgh A', 'Meyer C', 'Marschalek R', 'Preiss B', 'Hasle H', 'Kjeldsen E']","['Cancer Cytogenetics Section, Hemodiagnostic Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130530,Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.14.18.2 (CMPacetylneuraminate monooxygenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Fusion', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",,,2013/06/06 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/06 06:00'],"['2013/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['000351224 [pii]', '10.1159/000351224 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2013;141(1):7-15. doi: 10.1159/000351224.

A time-dependent increase in cell death and DNA cleavage was observed after 30muM Ptx treatment. Cell death induction by Ptx proceeds mainly as programmed cell death as shown by annexin V-FITC, reaching up to 30% of apoptotic cells after 24h. Significant reductions of p53, changes in Bax and Bcl-2 and activation of caspases 3 and 9 were observed as the treatment was applied for long times. Ptx treatments produced NFkB depletion with expression levels abolished at 19h what could be involved in reduction of survival signals. Phosphorylation of intracellular kinases showed that pERK1/2 decreased significantly at 19h of Ptx treatment. When these cells were preincubated for 90min with 20muM PD98059, 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone, an inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, a slight reduction of cell viability was observed in comparison to that produced by Ptx alone. Pretreatment with PD98059 neither activated caspases nor significantly increased the apoptotic effect of Ptx. Taken together, our data reveal that the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation does not seem to be an essential pathway for bursting an increased induction of apoptosis by Ptx. Decrease of p53 and Bcl-2, fragmentation of DNA, increase of Bax and, finally, activation of caspases 3 and 9 in NB4 leukaemia cells make the apoptotic process induced by Ptx irreversible. Application of Ptx in leukaemia cells shows therefore a promising potential with particular effects on different leukaemia cell types.","['Morales-Cano, Daniel', 'Calvino, Eva', 'Rubio, Virginia', 'Herraez, Angel', 'Sancho, Pilar', 'Tejedor, M Cristina', 'Diez, Jose C']","['Morales-Cano D', 'Calvino E', 'Rubio V', 'Herraez A', 'Sancho P', 'Tejedor MC', 'Diez JC']","['Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Campus Universitario, Universidad de Alcala, 28871 Alcala de Henares (Madrid), Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130602,Germany,Exp Toxicol Pathol,Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie,9208920,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2013/06/06 06:00,2014/06/08 06:00,['2013/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0940-2993(13)00058-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.etp.2013.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Toxicol Pathol. 2013 Nov;65(7-8):1101-8. doi: 10.1016/j.etp.2013.04.006.

To date, few programs exist for regional analysis of enriched or whole-genome bisulfate conversion sequencing data, even though such data are increasingly common. Here, we describe an open-source, optimized method for determining empirically based DMRs (eDMR) from high-throughput sequence data that is applicable to enriched whole-genome methylation profiling datasets, as well as other globally enriched epigenetic modification data. RESULTS: Here we show that our bimodal distribution model and weighted cost function for optimized regional methylation analysis provides accurate boundaries of regions harboring significant epigenetic modifications. Our algorithm takes the spatial distribution of CpGs into account for the enrichment assay, allowing for optimization of the definition of empirical regions for differential methylation. Combined with the dependent adjustment for regional p-value combination and DMR annotation, we provide a method that may be applied to a variety of datasets for rapid DMR analysis. Our method classifies both the directionality of DMRs and their genome-wide distribution, and we have observed that shows clinical relevance through correct stratification of two Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) tumor sub-types. CONCLUSIONS: Our weighted optimization algorithm eDMR for calling DMRs extends an established DMR R pipeline (methylKit) and provides a needed resource in epigenomics.

The objective was to describe infectious risk in children with newly diagnosed APL and to describe factors associated with these infections. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study that included children </= 18 years of age with de novo APL treated at 15 Canadian centers. Thirty-three children with APL were included; 78.8% were treated with APL -specific protocols. RESULTS: Bacterial sterile site infection occurred in 12 (36.4%) and fungal sterile site infection occurred in 2 (6.1%) children. Of the 127 chemotherapy courses, 101 (79.5%) were classified as intensive and among these, the proportion in which a sterile site microbiologically documented infection occurred was 14/101 (13.9%).

Both NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 are constitutively activated in B-cell CLL but not expressed in normal B cells and may be involved in survival and resistance to apoptosis in CLL. We screened for mutations in different parts of both NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 genes and related the changes to survival and other known risk factors. METHODS: In a cohort of 209 CLL patients, we used single strand conformation analysis to determine which of the samples carrying the NOTCH mutations and direct dideoxy sequencing was used to determine the exact nucleotide changes. Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank test were used to determine overall survival for NOTCH1 mutated cases and Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazardous ratios. RESULTS: In the present study, we found NOTCH1 PEST domain mutations in 6.7% of the cases. A shorter overall survival was found in patients with NOTCH1 mutations compared to wildtype (p = 0.049). Further, we also examined the extracellular and the heterodimerisation domains of the NOTCH1 gene and the PEST domain and heterodimerisation domain of the NOTCH2 gene, but no mutations were found in these regions. NOTCH1 mutations were most commonly observed in patients with unmutated IGHV gene (10/14), and associated with a more aggressive disease course. In addition, NOTCH1 mutations were almost mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations. In the combined group of NOTCH1 (6.7%) or TP53 (6.2%) mutations, a significant difference in overall survival compared to the wildtype NOTCH1 and TP53 was found (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Both NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations seem to be independent predictive markers for worse outcome in CLL-patients and this study emphasizes the contention that NOTCH1 mutations is a novel risk marker.","['Willander, Kerstin', 'Dutta, Ravi Kumar', 'Ungerback, Jonas', 'Gunnarsson, Rebeqa', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Fredrikson, Mats', 'Linderholm, Mats', 'Soderkvist, Peter']","['Willander K', 'Dutta RK', 'Ungerback J', 'Gunnarsson R', 'Juliusson G', 'Fredrikson M', 'Linderholm M', 'Soderkvist P']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Department of Hematology, County Council of Ostergotland, Linkoping University, SE-58185 Linkoping, Sweden. kerstin.willander@liu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130604,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",PMC3679784,,2013/06/06 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-274 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-274 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Jun 4;13:274. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the aim of uncovering the full spectrum of germline and somatic genetic alterations in childhood ALL genomes, we conducted whole-exome re-sequencing on a unique cohort of over 120 exomes of childhood ALL quartets, each comprising a patient's tumor and matched-normal material, and DNA from both parents. We developed a general probabilistic model for such quartet sequencing reads mapped to the reference human genome. The model is used to infer joint genotypes at homologous loci across a normal-tumor genome pair and two parental genomes.We describe the algorithms and data structures for genotype inference, model parameter training. We implemented the methods in an open-source software package (QUADGT) that uses the standard file formats of the 1000 Genomes Project.

Assigning clinical relevance to FIV infection in individual cats represents a considerable clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To compare signalment, hematologic and biochemical data, major clinical problem, and survival among client-owned, FIV-infected, and uninfected domestic cats. ANIMALS: Client-owned, domestic cats tested for FIV (n = 520). METHODS: Retrospective, case control study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors for FIV infection and to compare hematologic and biochemical data between cases and controls, after adjusting for potential confounders. Survival times were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: The prevalence of FIV infection was 14.6%. Mixed breed, male sex, and older age were risk factors for FIV infection. Hematologic abnormalities, biochemical abnormalities or both were common in both FIV-infected and uninfected cats. Lymphoid malignancies were slightly more common in FIV-infected than uninfected cats. Survival of FIV-infected cats was not significantly different from that of uninfected cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Multiple hematologic and biochemical abnormalities are common in old, sick cats regardless of their FIV status. Their presence should not be assumed to indicate clinical progression of FIV infection. A negative effect of FIV on survival was not apparent in this study.","['Liem, B P', 'Dhand, N K', 'Pepper, A E', 'Barrs, V R', 'Beatty, J A']","['Liem BP', 'Dhand NK', 'Pepper AE', 'Barrs VR', 'Beatty JA']","['Valentine Charlton Cat Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130604,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,,IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cat Diseases/mortality/pathology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Lentivirus Infections/mortality/pathology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Retroviridae Infections/veterinary/virology', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/veterinary/virology']",,,2013/06/06 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jvim.12120 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2013 Jul-Aug;27(4):798-805. doi: 10.1111/jvim.12120.

This study was carried out to investigate how to improve the anticancer effects of alpha-mangostin in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines bearing wild-type BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL-T315I mutation. We showed that alpha-mangostin inhibited cell proliferation of K562, KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. Significantly, alpha-mangostin increased the number of apoptotic cells and induced DNA fragmentation compared to control cells. Moreover, alpha-mangostin selectively inhibited proliferation in primary CML cells, while showing limited lethality in normal hematopoietic progenitors. Additionally, alpha-mangostin induced not only apoptosis but also autophagy in CML cells. alpha-Mangostin dramatically increased the expression levels of LC-3II, an autophagosome marker in mammals, and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs). Inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine enhanced alpha-mangostin-mediated cytotoxicity through increasing apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that targeting the autophagy pathway is a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance alpha-mangostin-induced apoptosis.

Treatment of APL patients with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) reverses the disease phenotype by a process involving the degradation of the fusion protein via its PML moiety. Several PML isoforms are generated from a single PML gene by alternative splicing. They share the same N-terminal region containing the RBCC/tripartite motif but differ in their C-terminal sequences. Recent studies of all the PML isoforms reveal the specific functions of each. Here, we review the nomenclature and structural organization of the PML isoforms in order to clarify the various designations and classifications found in different databases. The functions of the PML isoforms and their differential roles in antiviral defense also are reviewed.

Here, we investigated whether Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME)-specific T cells could be induced upon the priming of healthy donor- and AML patient-derived T cells with HLA-A2-matched, peptide-loaded allogeneic dendritic cells. AML-reactive, tetramer (Tm)-binding and interferon-producing, cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for PRAME could readily be isolated from healthy individuals and maintained in culture. In this setting, priming efficacy was significantly higher for PRAME than for WT1. The priming of T cells from patient-derived material proved to be near-to-impossible: No leukemia-associated antigen (LAA)-specific T cell could be primed in 4 patients that had recently achieved a complete response (CR), and in only 1 out of 3 patients exhibiting a sustained CR we did observe WT1-specific T cells, though with a low frequency. These findings suggest that the functionality and/or repertoire of T cells differ in healthy subjects and AML patients in CR, and may have repercussions for the implementation of active vaccination approaches against AML.","['van den Ancker, Willemijn', 'Ruben, Jurjen M', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Wulandari, Dewi', 'Bontkes, Hetty J', 'Hooijberg, Erik', 'Stam, Anita G M', 'Santegoets, Saskia J A M', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'de Gruijl, Tanja', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan']","['van den Ancker W', 'Ruben JM', 'Westers TM', 'Wulandari D', 'Bontkes HJ', 'Hooijberg E', 'Stam AG', 'Santegoets SJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'de Gruijl T', 'van de Loosdrecht A']","['Department of Hematology; VU University Medical Center/Cancer Center Amsterdam; Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,PMC3654602,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/06/05 06:01,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/onci.23971 [doi]', '2012ONCOIMM0337R [pii]']",ppublish,Oncoimmunology. 2013 Apr 1;2(4):e23971. doi: 10.4161/onci.23971.,,['NOTNLM'],"['PRAME', 'T- cell priming', 'WT1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'dendritic cell-based vaccination', 'immunotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use the model system Drosophila melanogaster to genetically dissect the toxicity of methotrexate (MTX), a drug used primarily to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis. We use the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from a multiparent advanced intercross, and quantify MTX toxicity as a reduction in female fecundity. We identify three quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting MTX toxicity; two colocalize with the fly orthologs of human genes believed to mediate MTX toxicity and one is a novel MTX toxicity gene with a human ortholog. A fourth suggestive QTL spans a centromere. Local single-marker association scans of candidate gene exons fail to implicate amino acid variants as the causative single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and we therefore hypothesize the causative variation is regulatory. In addition, the effects at our mapped QTL do not conform to a simple biallelic pattern, suggesting multiple causative factors underlie the QTL mapping results. Consistent with this observation, no single single-nucleotide polymorphism located in or near a candidate gene can explain the QTL mapping signal. Overall, our results validate D. melanogaster as a model for uncovering the genetic basis of chemotoxicity and suggest the genetic basis of MTX toxicity is due to a handful of genes each harboring multiple segregating regulatory factors.","['Kislukhin, Galina', 'King, Elizabeth G', 'Walters, Kelli N', 'Macdonald, Stuart J', 'Long, Anthony D']","['Kislukhin G', 'King EG', 'Walters KN', 'Macdonald SJ', 'Long AD']","['Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California 92697-2525, USA.']",['eng'],"['F32 GM099382/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM085251/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR024862/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130807,England,G3 (Bethesda),"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Centromere/drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Transposable Elements/genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Fertility/*drug effects', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*toxicity', 'Models, Genetic', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Quantitative Trait Loci']",PMC3737169,,2013/06/05 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['g3.113.006619 [pii]', '10.1534/g3.113.006619 [doi]']",epublish,G3 (Bethesda). 2013 Aug 7;3(8):1301-10. doi: 10.1534/g3.113.006619.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Drosophila synthetic population resource', 'chemotoxicity', 'methotrexate', 'pharmacogenomics', 'quantitative trait loci']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these mice established with cells from a chronic-type patient, treatment by i.p. injection of autologous Tax-CTL resulted in greater infiltration of CD8-positive T cells into each ATL lesion. This was associated with a significant decrease of ATL cell infiltration into blood, spleen, and liver. Tax-CTL treatment also significantly decreased human soluble IL-2R concentrations in the sera. In another group of ATL/NOG mice, Tax-CTL treatment led to a significant prolongation of survival time. These findings show that Tax-CTL can infiltrate the tumor site, recognize, and kill autologous ATL cells in mice in vivo. In ATL/NOG mice with cells from an acute-type patient, whose postchemotherapeutic remission continued for >18 mo, antitumor efficacy of adoptive Tax-CTL therapy was also observed. However, in ATL/NOG mice from a different acute-type patient, whose ATL relapsed after 6 mo of remission, no efficacy was observed. Thus, although the therapeutic effects were different for different ATL patients, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that adoptive therapy with Ag-specific CTL expanded from a cancer patient confers antitumor effects, leading to significant survival benefit for autologous primary cancer cell-bearing mice in vivo.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received decitabine 20 mg/m(2) SC per day for 3 consecutive days on days 1, 2, and 3 every 28 days (schedule A) or 20 mg/m(2) SC per day once every 7 days on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days (schedule B) for up to 1 year. Primary efficacy end point was overall improvement rate (OIR: complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], marrow CR [mCR], or hematologic improvement [HI]). Secondary end points were HI, transfusion independence, cytogenetic response, overall survival (OS), and time to acute myeloid leukemia or death. RESULTS: Efficacy and safety populations were identical: schedule A, n = 43; schedule B, n = 22. Median time from MDS diagnosis to treatment was 3.6 months; 89% had de novo MDS. The trial was terminated early on achievement of protocol-defined OIR superiority of schedule A over schedule B; OIR was 23% for schedule A (seven CRs, three HIs) and 23% for schedule B (one mCR, one PR, three HIs). No differences were observed in secondary end points. Median OS was not reached; approximately 70% of patients were alive at 500 days. Patients in schedule A (67%) and schedule B (59%) were RBC/platelet independent on study. The most frequent drug-related adverse events overall were neutropenia (28% v 36%), anemia (23% v 18%), and thrombocytopenia (16% v 32%).

Using a novel approach, we adoptively transferred conventional T cells expressing the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), which confers effector properties resembling invariant natural killer T cells, such as copious production of cytokines under suboptimal stimulation. PLZF expression in T-cell allografts attenuates expansion of alloreactive T cells, leading to lower GVHD. Intact alloreactivity-driven antitumor cytokine responses result in preserved GVT effects, leading to improved survival. Our findings suggest that therapy with PLZF-overexpressing T cells would result in overall improved outcomes due to less GVHD and intact GVT effects.","['Ghosh, Arnab', 'Holland, Amanda M', 'Dogan, Yildirim', 'Yim, Nury L', 'Rao, Uttam K', 'Young, Lauren F', 'West, Mallory L', 'Singer, Natalie V', 'Lee, Hae', 'Na, Il-Kang', 'Tsai, Jennifer J', 'Jenq, Robert R', 'Penack, Olaf', 'Hanash, Alan M', 'Lezcano, Cecilia', 'Murphy, George F', 'Liu, Chen', 'Sadelain, Michel', 'Sauer, Martin G', ""Sant'angelo, Derek"", 'van den Brink, Marcel R M']","['Ghosh A', 'Holland AM', 'Dogan Y', 'Yim NL', 'Rao UK', 'Young LF', 'West ML', 'Singer NV', 'Lee H', 'Na IK', 'Tsai JJ', 'Jenq RR', 'Penack O', 'Hanash AM', 'Lezcano C', 'Murphy GF', 'Liu C', 'Sadelain M', 'Sauer MG', ""Sant'angelo D"", 'van den Brink MR']","['Departments of Immunology and Medicine, and Cell Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. ghosha1@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['R01 AI101406/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL069929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI100288/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL069929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI100288/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI101406/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI080455/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107096/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI080455/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007621/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130603,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3732814,['NIHMS489572'],2013/06/05 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-4699 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4699 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Aug 1;73(15):4687-96. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4699.

Few studies have examined these outcomes in ethnic minority samples, despite speculation that socio-demographic factors may increase vulnerability for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes. We evaluated the neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes and their impact on the health-related quality of life in survivors of childhood cancer drawn from Latino families in the Los Angeles region. PROCEDURE: Using culturally-relevant recruitment strategies, 73 predominantly Spanish-speaking parents of pediatric brain tumor or leukemia survivors completed standardized questionnaires, including the Conners parent-report and the Bidimensional Acculturation Scales. Clinical and socio-demographic factors influencing the development of neurocognitive and behavioral dysfunction were examined. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of the children placed at or above the ""elevated"" level for difficulties with attention, school-based learning, and peer relations. Younger age at diagnosis significantly predicted dysfunction in inattention, learning problems, and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Children whose parents were less adherent to the non-Hispanic white culture were more likely to have problems with peer relations and executive functioning. HRQL was significantly lower in survivors with neurocognitive and behavioral dysfunction relative to those with normal range scores on the Conners scale. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the child's age at diagnosis, acculturation appears to predict select neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes in this socio-demographically homogeneous sample of Latino families. Further research is needed to understand the interaction of ethnic and cultural factors with therapeutic exposures in determining the adverse neurobehavioral outcomes, so as to optimally design interventions.","['Patel, Sunita K', 'Lo, Tracy T Y', 'Dennis, Jessica M', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Patel SK', 'Lo TT', 'Dennis JM', 'Bhatia S']","['Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center & Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, CA, USA. spatel@coh.org']",['eng'],"['P20 CA118775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 CA118783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P20CA118783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P20CA118775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130603,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Impulsive Behavior/*epidemiology/therapy', '*Learning', 'Learning Disabilities/*epidemiology/therapy', '*Leukemia', 'Male', 'Psychomotor Agitation/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors']",PMC3776597,['NIHMS506766'],2013/06/05 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24608 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Oct;60(10):1696-702. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24608.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using a medication diary-book on the treatment outcome of childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: A randomized study was conducted with 109 pediatric patients with ALL in a pediatric oncology center in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Both intervention and control groups received a structured parental education program and donated chemotherapy. The intervention group received a medication diary-book to remind parents and families to take oral chemotherapy and present for scheduled appointments or admissions. Event-free survival estimate (EFS) at 3 years was assessed. RESULTS: Among pediatric patients with ALL with highly educated mothers (senior high school or higher), the EFS-estimate at 3 years of the intervention group was significantly higher than the EFS-estimate at 3 years of the control group (62% vs. 29%, P = 0.04). Among pediatric patients with ALL with low-educated mothers, no significant difference was found in the EFS-estimates at 3 years between the intervention and control group (26% vs. 18%, P = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a medication diary-book might be useful to improve the survival of pediatric patients with ALL in resource-limited settings, particularly in patients with highly educated mothers.","['Sitaresmi, Mei N', 'Mostert, Saskia', 'Gundy, Chad M', 'Ismail, Djauhar', 'Veerman, Anjo J P']","['Sitaresmi MN', 'Mostert S', 'Gundy CM', 'Ismail D', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Dr Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130603,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Medical Records', '*Parents', '*Patient Education as Topic', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24570 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Oct;60(10):1593-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24570.

HSCT indications for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) now include high-risk patients in first and subsequent remission. There is a large burden of infectious and pre-HSCT morbidities, due to myelosuppressive therapy required for remission induction. We hypothesized that, despite these trends, overall survival (OS) had increased. PROCEDURE: A retrospective audit of allogeneic pediatric HSCT for ALL was performed in our institution over 25 years. Outcomes for 136 HSCTs were analyzed in three consecutive 8-year periods (Period 1: 1/1/1984-31/8/1992, Period 2: 1/9/1992-30/4/2001, Period 3: 1/5/2001-31/12/2009). RESULTS: Despite a significant increase in unrelated donor HSCT, event-free and OS over 25 years improved significantly. (EFS 31.6-64.8%, P = 0.0027; OS 41.8-78.9%, P < 0.0001) Concurrently, TRM dropped from 33% to 5% (P = 0.0004) whilst relapse rate was static (P = 0.07). TRM reduced significantly for matched sibling and unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCT) in Period 3 compared with earlier periods (P = 0.036, P = 0.0098, respectively). Factors leading to improved survival in patients undergoing UCT include better matching, higher total nucleated cell doses, and significantly faster neutrophil engraftment. Length of initial HSCT admission was similar over time. CONCLUSION: EFS and OS have increased significantly despite heightened HSCT complexity. This survival gain was due to TRM reduction. Contemporary patients have benefited from refined donor selection and improved supportive care. Overall rates of leukemic relapse post-HSCT are unchanged, and remain the focus for improvement.","['Mateos, Marion K', ""O'Brien, Tracey A"", 'Oswald, Cecilia', 'Gabriel, Melissa', 'Ziegler, David S', 'Cohn, Richard J', 'Russell, Susan J', 'Barbaric, Draga', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Trahair, Toby N']","['Mateos MK', ""O'Brien TA"", 'Oswald C', 'Gabriel M', 'Ziegler DS', 'Cohn RJ', 'Russell SJ', 'Barbaric D', 'Marshall GM', 'Trahair TN']","[""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130603,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3798104,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24559 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Sep;60(9):1520-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24559.

We explored familial aggregation of cancer in a population-based case-control study using genealogical record linkage and designed to overcome limitations of previous studies. Subjects were selected from the Utah Population Database. We compared risk of cancer in adult first-degree relatives of children who were diagnosed with cancer with the risk in relatives of children who had not had a cancer diagnosed. We identified 1,894 childhood cancer cases and 3,788 controls; 7,467 relatives of cases and 14,498 relatives of controls were included in the analysis. Relatives of children with cancer had a higher risk of cancer in adulthood than relatives of children without cancer [odds ratio (OR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.56]; this was restricted to mothers and siblings and was not evident in fathers. Familial aggregation appeared stronger among relatives of cases diagnosed before 5 years of age (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.13-1.95) than among relatives of cases who were older when diagnosed (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.98-1.51).

However, smudge cells are a cytological artifact influenced by multiple physical factors not related to CLL. To identify simple parameters reflecting CLL cell fragility, we studied CD45 expression in a series of 66 patients with Binet stage A CLL. Decreased CD45 expression was specific for CLL cells when compared to 44 patients with a leukemic phase of B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma and 42 control B-cells. CD45 expression was markedly decreased for all patients with CLL with high percentages of smudge cells. CLL cells with the lowest CD45 expression were the most sensitive to osmotic shock. Very low levels of CD45 expression were significantly associated with lack of CD38 expression, absence of trisomy 12, and with increased treatment free survival time. Altogether, these results demonstrate that low levels of CD45 expression are specific to CLL cells and reflect cell fragility, suggesting that this is an important intrinsic biological feature that determines disease course.","['Rizzo, David', 'Lotay, Angad', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Marfak, Ibtissam', 'Faucher, Jean-Luc', 'Trimoreau, Franck', 'Guerin, Estelle', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Jaccard, Arnaud', 'Feuillard, Jean']","['Rizzo D', 'Lotay A', 'Gachard N', 'Marfak I', 'Faucher JL', 'Trimoreau F', 'Guerin E', 'Bordessoule D', 'Jaccard A', 'Feuillard J']","['Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital Dupuytren, Limoges, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Osmotic Pressure', '*Trisomy']",,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23494 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Sep;88(9):747-53. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23494.

We investigated the clinical characteristics (age, sex, seasonal variation, lesion site, symptoms, complications, prognosis, and sequelae) and risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in 266 cases treated at our hospital in Hangzhou City, China, from January 2011 to December 2011. Risk of ICH increased dramatically with age; only 4.3% of cases were <30 years old, while 44.4% were >60 years of age. Men outnumbered women by 2:1 (67.3% vs. 32.7%). Single hemorrhage was most often located in the cerebral lobes (37.2% of cases), basal ganglia (34.2%), thalamus (8.3%), cerebellum (6.8%), ventricle (1.5%), and brainstem (1.1%), while 10.9% of cases exhibited hemorrhages at multiple sites. Hypertension was also a major risk factor for ICH, as 47% of all patients were hypertensive and the percentage increased with age. In hypertensive patients, the most common hemorrhage site was the basal ganglia and ICH was often associated with thrombopenia. In patients with leukemia (all forms), most hemorrhages were lobar. Warfarin- and encephalic operation-associated ICHs were all lobar. Headache was the major symptom of occipital, temporal, and frontal lobe hemorrhage. Dizziness, nausea, and vomiting were the major symptoms of cerebellum hemorrhage. Limb dysfunction was the major symptom of thalamic and basal ganglia hemorrhage. Disturbed level of consciousness was the major symptom in multisite, ventricular, parietal lobe, and brainstem hemorrhage. Hyperspasmia occurred most often in lobar hemorrhage and blurred vision in occipital lobe hemorrhage. Hospital mortality was 24.4% (n=65) with a mean delay from presentation to death of (10.5+/-18.5) d. The majority of fatalities were cerebral hernia cases (58.5%) and these patients also had the shortest time to death [(2.9+/-3.5) d]. Mortality was 100% in brainstem ICH and hemorrhagic conversion of cerebral infarct.

We performed exome sequencing in 7 TMD/AMKL cases and copy-number analysis in these and 10 additional cases. All TMD/AMKL samples contained GATA1 mutations. No exome-sequenced TMD/AMKL sample had other recurrently mutated genes. However, 2 of 5 TMD cases, and all AMKL cases, showed mutations/deletions other than GATA1, in genes proven as transformation drivers in non-DS leukemia (EZH2, APC, FLT3, JAK1, PARK2-PACRG, EXT1, DLEC1, and SMC3). One patient at the TMD stage revealed 2 clonal expansions with different GATA1 mutations, of which 1 clone had an additional driver mutation. Interestingly, it was the other clone that gave rise to AMKL after accumulating mutations in 7 other genes. Data suggest that GATA1 mutations alone are sufficient for clonal expansions, and additional driver mutations at the TMD stage do not necessarily predict AMKL progression. Later in infancy, leukemic progression requires ""third-hit driver"" mutations/somatic copy-number alterations found in non-DS leukemias.

Patients may present with lymphopenia or pancytopenia at diagnosis. We investigated the mechanisms by which AML causes pancytopenia and suppresses patients' immune response. This study identified for the first time that AML blasts alter the immune microenvironment through enhanced arginine metabolism. Arginase II is expressed and released from AML blasts and is present at high concentrations in the plasma of patients with AML, resulting in suppression of T-cell proliferation. We extended these results by demonstrating an arginase-dependent ability of AML blasts to polarize surrounding monocytes into a suppressive M2-like phenotype in vitro and in engrafted nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency mice. In addition, AML blasts can suppress the proliferation and differentiation of murine granulocyte-monocyte progenitors and human CD34(+) progenitors. Finally, the study showed that the immunosuppressive activity of AML blasts can be modulated through small-molecule inhibitors of arginase and inducible nitric oxide synthase, suggesting a novel therapeutic target in AML. The results strongly support the hypothesis that AML creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment that contributes to the pancytopenia observed at diagnosis.","['Mussai, Francis', 'De Santo, Carmela', 'Abu-Dayyeh, Issa', 'Booth, Sarah', 'Quek, Lynn', 'McEwen-Smith, Rosanna M', 'Qureshi, Amrana', 'Dazzi, Francesco', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Cerundolo, Vincenzo']","['Mussai F', 'De Santo C', 'Abu-Dayyeh I', 'Booth S', 'Quek L', 'McEwen-Smith RM', 'Qureshi A', 'Dazzi F', 'Vyas P', 'Cerundolo V']","['Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Radcliffe Department ofMedicine, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['11331/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'C399/A2291/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MC_U137961146/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130603,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Arginase/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Escape/physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology/physiology']",PMC3731930,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/10/29 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56042-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-480129 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 1;122(5):749-58. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-480129.

Mcl-1 has been reported to have a short half-life, and Noxa up-regulation accelerates Mcl-1 degradation by the proteasome. Unlike human Noxa, mouse Noxa has two BH3-domains, which both have affinity for Mcl-1. We here investigate two aspects of the molecular function of Noxa, namely the requirements for the two BH3-domains in mouse Noxa and the role of Noxa in Mcl-1-degradation. We found that only the C-terminal BH3-domain of mouse Noxa is active in neutralizing Mcl-1. This was the result of the targeting of Noxa to the outer mitochondrial membrane through its C-terminal alpha-helix, which allowed Mcl-1-neutralization only when the BH3-domain was immediately N-terminal of the membrane anchor. However, the N-terminal BH3-domain enhanced interaction with Mcl-1 and A1. The Noxa-dependent degradation of Mcl-1 was independent of the kinase GSK3 and the deubiquitinase Usp9x in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These data show that Noxa is targeted to the mitochondrial membrane where it neutralises Mcl-1 via its C-terminal BH3-domain and suggest that Noxa is co-degraded with Noxa, in a way independent of ubiquitin-modifying enzymes described for Mcl-1.","['Weber, Arnim', 'Auslander, David', 'Hacker, Georg']","['Weber A', 'Auslander D', 'Hacker G']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Freiburg, 79104, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/06/05 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0868-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Sep;18(9):1093-105. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0868-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The renal tumor in the left kidney had a diameter of 3 cm and showed a grey-brown cut surface. Histologically, the tumor presented with a typical thyroid-like microfollicular and macrofollicular structure filled with eosinophilic, colloid-like material with calcification.

In this study, we investigated whether HaA4 has anticancer activity against human leukemia cell lines such as U937 and Jurkat cells. HaA4 manifested cytotoxicity and decreased the cell viability of U937 and Jurkat cells in MTS assay and LDH release assay. We found that HaA4 induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death of the leukemia cells using flow cytometric analysis, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and nucleosomal fragmentation of genomic DNA. Activation of caspase-7 and -9 and fragmentation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase was detected in the HaA4-treated leukemia cells, suggesting induction of a caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway by HaA4. Caspase-dependent apoptosis was further confirmed by reversal of the HaA4-induced viability reduction by treatment of Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor. In conclusion, HaA4 caused necrosis and caspase-dependent apoptosis in both U937 and Jurkat leukemia cells, which suggests potential utility of HaA4 as a cancer therapeutic agent.","['Kim, In-Woo', 'Lee, Joon Ha', 'Kwon, Young-Nam', 'Yun, Eun-Young', 'Nam, Sung-Hee', 'Ahn, Mi-Young', 'Kang, Dong-Chul', 'Hwang, Jae Sam']","['Kim IW', 'Lee JH', 'Kwon YN', 'Yun EY', 'Nam SH', 'Ahn MY', 'Kang DC', 'Hwang JS']","['Department of Agricultural Biology, National Academy of Agricultural Science, RDA, Suwon 441-853, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130604,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HaA4 peptide)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 7/drug effects/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Insect Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/drug effects/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,,2013/06/05 06:00,2014/03/22 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.1973 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2013 Aug;43(2):622-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.1973.

In 3, both molecules present a different coordination geometry (distorted square planar and distorted square pyramidal) while in 4 they have an identical coordination environment (distorted square planar). The propensity for binding of 1-4 to calf thymus DNA was studied by thermal denaturation, viscosimetry, and fluorescence measurements. Results indicated that the N-sulfonamide derivative plays an important role in governing the type of interaction with DNA. The ability of the complexes to cleave DNA was studied in vitro with ascorbate activation and was tested by monitoring the expression of the yEGFP gene containing the RAD54 reporter. Moreover, their antiproliferative activity was verified in two cellular models: yeast and human tumor cells in culture. Their DNA cleavage efficiency at the cellular level was found to be: 1 < 3 ~ 4 < 2. The higher propensity of 2 for inflicting DNA damage was related with its higher binding affinity to DNA.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 converts sorafenib to multiple metabolites that have been detected in patient plasma. However, recent clinical findings suggest that combination therapy may elicit inhibitory pharmacokinetic interactions involving sorafenib that increase toxicity. While sorafenib N-oxide is an active metabolite, information on the anti-tumor actions of other metabolites is unavailable. The present study evaluated the actions of sorafenib and its five major metabolites in human breast cancer cell lines. All agents, with the exception of N'-hydroxymethylsorafenib N-oxide, decreased ATP formation in four breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7 and T-47D). Prolonged treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with N'-desmethylsorafenib, N'-desmethylsorafenib N-oxide and sorafenib (10 muM, 72 h) produced small increases in caspase-3 activity to 128-139% of control. Sorafenib and its metabolites, again with the exception of N'-hydroxymethylsorafenib N-oxide, impaired MEK/ERK signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells and modulated the expression of cyclin D1 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1, which regulate cell viability. When coadministered with doxorubicin (0.5 or 1 muM), sorafenib and N'-desmethylsorafenib (25 muM) produced greater effects on ATP production than either treatment alone. Thus, it emerges that, by targeting the MEK/ERK pathway, multiple sorafenib metabolites may contribute to the actions of sorafenib in breast cancer. Because N'-desmethylsorafenib is not extensively metabolized and does not inhibit major hepatic CYPs, this metabolite may have a lower propensity to precipitate pharmacokinetic drug interactions than sorafenib.","['Cui, Pei H', 'Rawling, Tristan', 'Gillani, Tina B', 'Bourget, Kirsi', 'Wang, Xiao-Suo', 'Zhou, Fanfan', 'Murray, Michael']","['Cui PH', 'Rawling T', 'Gillani TB', 'Bourget K', 'Wang XS', 'Zhou F', 'Murray M']","['Pharmacogenomics and Drug Development Group, Discipline of Pharmacology, University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130531,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymology', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib']",,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(13)00329-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2013.05.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2013 Aug 1;86(3):419-27. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2013.05.014.

As such, they prevent the natural ends of linear chromosomes from being subjected to DNA repair activities that would result in telomere fusion, degradation, or recombination. Both the DNA and protein components of the telomere are required for this essential function, because insufficient telomeric DNA length, loss of the terminal telomeric DNA structure, or deficiency of key telomere-associated factors may elicit a DNA damage response and result in cellular senescence or apoptosis. In the setting of failed checkpoint mechanisms, such DNA-protein defects can also lead to genomic instability through telomere fusions or recombination. Thus, as shown in both model systems and in humans, defects in telomere biology are implicated in cellular and organismal aging as well as in tumorigenesis. Bone marrow failure and malignancy are 2 life-threatening disease manifestations in the inherited telomere biology disorder dyskeratosis congenita. We provide an overview of basic telomere structure and maintenance. We outline the telomere biology defects observed in dyskeratosis congenita, focusing on recent discoveries in this field.

Recently, genome-wide technologies have been intensively applied to CLL genetics, with remarkable progress. Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays have identified recurring chromosomal aberrations, thereby focusing functional studies on discrete genomic lesions and leading to the first implication of somatic microRNA disruption in cancer. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has further transformed our understanding of CLL by identifying novel recurrently mutated putative drivers, including the unexpected discovery of somatic mutations affecting spliceosome function. NGS has further enabled in-depth examination of the transcriptional and epigenetic changes in CLL that accompany genetic lesions, and has shed light on how different driver events appear at different stages of disease progression and clonally evolve with relapsed disease. In addition to providing important insights into disease biology, these discoveries have significant translational potential. They enhance prognosis by highlighting specific lesions associated with poor clinical outcomes (for example, driver events such as mutations in the splicing factor subunit gene SF3B1) or with increased clonal heterogeneity (for example, the presence of subclonal driver mutations).

In response to stress signals, PML coordinates the regulation of numerous proteins, which activate fundamental cellular processes that suppress tumorigenesis. Importantly, PML itself is the subject of specific post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which in turn control PML activity and stability and ultimately dictate cellular fate. Improved understanding of the regulation of this key tumor suppressor is uncovering potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Targeting the key negative regulators of PML in cancer cells such as casein kinase 2, big MAP kinase 1, and E6-associated protein, with specific inhibitors that are becoming available, provides unique and exciting avenues for restoring tumor suppression through the induction of apoptosis and senescence. These approaches could be combined with DNA damaging drugs and cytokines that are known to activate PML. Depending on the cellular context, reactivation or enhancement of tumor suppressive PML functions, or targeted elimination of aberrantly functioning PML, may provide clinical benefit.","['Wolyniec, Kamil', 'Carney, Dennis A', 'Haupt, Sue', 'Haupt, Ygal']","['Wolyniec K', 'Carney DA', 'Haupt S', 'Haupt Y']","['Tumour Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre East Melbourne, VIC, Australia ; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130517,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC3656422,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/06/05 06:01,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00124 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 May 17;3:124. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00124. eCollection 2013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BMK1', 'CK2', 'E6AP', 'KLHL20', 'PML', 'small molecule inhibitors', 'targeted anti-cancer therapy', 'tumour suppression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with GSIs and glucocorticoids are strongly synergistic and may overcome the gastrointestinal toxicity associated with systemic inhibition of the NOTCH pathway.

In vitro studies suggest that cytotoxic activity of bendamustine on CLL-derived cells is synergized by rituximab. A retrospective chart review was conducted to characterize treatment-naive outpatients and those with relapsed disease aged 70 years and over with CLL receiving bendamustine (with or without rituximab) and to evaluate real-world patterns of care, safety, and effectiveness. METHODS: Using McKesson Specialty Care/US Oncology Network iKnowMed databases, 91 outpatients with at least two recorded visits and at least two cycles of bendamustine monotherapy or bendamustine-rituximab combination therapy were identified and included. Mean age at diagnosis and start of first therapy was 70.3 and 77.4 years respectively, and 63.7% of patients were men. RESULTS: Observed overall response rate was 56.3% in pooled treatment-naive patients [n = 9; complete response (CR) 18.8%; partial response (PR) 37.5%; nodular partial response (nPR) 0%] and 58.7% in pooled patients with relapsed disease (n = 44; CR 13.3%; PR 44.0%; nPR 1.3%). Median time to progressive disease has not been reached for the 16 treatment-naive patients (median follow up 15.1 months), and was 18.4 months for those with relapsed disease (n = 73). No unexpected toxicities were observed. Overall rate of blood/bone marrow toxicities (all grades) was 40.7%; grade 3/4 rates were 18.8% in treatment-naive patients and 25.3% in those with relapsed disease. Most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were fatigue and rash. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective chart review of 91 outpatients with CLL aged 70 years and over, bendamustine (with or without rituximab) was an effective therapeutic option with manageable toxicity.","['Kolibaba, Kathryn S', 'Sterchele, James A', 'Joshi, Avani D', 'Forsyth, Michael', 'Alwon, Erin', 'Beygi, Hooman', 'Kennealey, Gerard T']","['Kolibaba KS', 'Sterchele JA', 'Joshi AD', 'Forsyth M', 'Alwon E', 'Beygi H', 'Kennealey GT']","['Compass Oncology, 120 SE 136th Avenue, Vancouver, WA 98684, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC3666446,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/06/05 06:01,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620713478629 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620713478629 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2013 Jun;4(3):157-71. doi: 10.1177/2040620713478629.,,['NOTNLM'],"['bendamustine', 'chart review', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'retrospective', 'rituximab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The entrapment of C-61 was obtained using the pH gradient procedure with lactobionic acid (LBA) being used as a low pH buffer inside the NP. Formulation F6A was selected as a lead candidate for further biological testing. The average diameter, zeta potential and C-61 content of the F6A NP was 40 nm, 0.1 mV, and 12.6 mg/ml, respectively. F6A induces apoptosis in SYK(+) but not SYK(-) leukemia/lymphoma cells. We also evaluated the cytotoxic activity of F6A in the context of an in vitro artificial bone marrow assay platform based on a 3D scaffold with inverted colloidal crystal geometry mimicking the structural topology of actual bone marrow matrix. The ability of C-61 to induce apoptosis in ALL-1 cells was not adversely affected by the scaffolds. F6A, but not the drug-free NP formulation F6B, caused apoptosis of MCL cell lines MAVER-1 and MINO within 24h.

However, it remains unclear whether Tax2 encoded by the closely related human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 utilizes any post-translational mechanisms to activate NF-kappaB. This study examines the role of ubiquitination and SUMOylation in Tax2 activation of NF-kappaB. The authors have demonstrated that, in contrast to Tax1, Tax2 is not conjugated by ubiquitin or SUMO proteins. Overexpression of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 specifically enhances Tax1, but not Tax2, ubiquitination and NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, a Tax2 lysineless mutant that is unable to be ubiquitinated, SUMOylated or acetylated retains NEMO/IKKgamma interactions and activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Together, these results provide evidence that Tax1 and Tax2 utilize distinct mechanisms to activate NF-kappaB.","['Lavorgna, Alfonso', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Lavorgna A', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA128115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM083143/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,England,Future Virol,Future virology,101278124,,,,PMC3665948,['NIHMS466946'],2013/06/05 06:00,2013/06/05 06:01,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/fvl.13.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Virol. 2013 Mar;8(3):223-227. doi: 10.2217/fvl.13.1.,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'HTLV-2', 'NF-kappaB', 'SUMOylation', 'Tax', 'ubiquitination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of commonly used immune-markers for immunophenotyping of AL and to define the best immune-markers to be used for proper diagnosis and classification of AL. Besides, to recognize the frequency of different AL subtypes and the antigen expression profile in our Egyptian patients. We retrospectively analyzed the immunophenotypic data of 164 de novo AL patients from our institution during 2009 and 2010. Among these patients, 68.9% were classified as acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) while 31.1% classified as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The commonest FAB subtype in AML group was AML-M4/5 (34.5%) which may differ from most published data. As regard ALL, there were 74.5% with B-ALL and 25.5% with T-ALL. It was found that combined use of HLADR and CD34 was much more helpful in distinguishing APL from non-APL AML than either of these antigens alone. It was found that cCD79a and CD19 were the most sensitive marker for B-ALL while cCD3, CD7 and CD5 were the most sensitive antigens for T-ALL. Our analysis of AL phenotypes proved that employed antibody panels are adequate for proper diagnosis and classification of AL. Flowcytometry was found to be especially useful in the identification of AML-M0 and differentiation of APL from non-APL AML. Immunophenotyping results and FAB classification of our AL patients were comparable to internationally published studies apart from predominance of AML-M4/5 and more frequent APL.","['Salem, Dalia A', 'Abd El-Aziz, Sherin M']","['Salem DA', 'Abd El-Aziz SM']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Hematology Unit, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110921,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC3332273,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/06/05 06:01,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-011-0110-2 [doi]', '110 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2012 Jun;28(2):89-96. doi: 10.1007/s12288-011-0110-2.

The aim of our study was to see the efficacy, tolerability, toxicity and safety of imatinib in eastern Indian subset of CML population. The present study enrolled 831 patients with CML out of which 197 were excluded due to various reasons of noncompliance, death and not being fit to receive the drug. The rest, 634 (76% of total enrolled) were selected for the evaluation. In the beginning of the study, 603 patients were in chronic phase, 27 in accelerated phase and 4 patients in blast crisis phase. Among 634 patients, 280 patients (44%) received previously either interferon alpha or hydroxyurea and other 354 patients (56%) were previously untreated. Complete hematological remission and major cytogenetic response were 91 and 67%, respectively after 1 year of treatment. Complete molecular remission was 35% after 1 year of treatment. Sixty-four patients (10.1%) were resistant to imatinib mesylate in 5 years. The disease free and overall survival at 60 months were 72.2 and 76.1% respectively.

MATERIAL/METHODS: Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with a drug resistant leukemia cell line K562/ADM. Tumor-bearing animals were divided into control, adriamycin, HSS and combination therapy (adriamycin plus HSS) groups. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis of tumor cells, and RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of mdr1, BCR/ABL and sorcin. RESULTS: The apoptosis rate in the high (71.8%), medium (72.3%) and low doses HSS group (72.4%) was higher than in control (1.2%, p<0.01), adriamycin (34.4%, p<0.05) or combination therapy group (46.4%, p<0.05). The mean optical density of mdr1, BCR/ABL and sorcin in HSS groups was lower than in control, adriamycin and combination therapy group (p<0.01). The optical density of the three genes in high HSS group was lower than in medium and low HSS group (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Haishengsu promotes apoptosis of drug-resistant K562/ADM tumors in mice in a dose-dependent manner. The pro-apoptotic effect of Haishengsu may be related to a reduced expression of multidrug-resistance genes mdr1, BCR/ABL and sorcin.","['Li, G Y', 'Liu, J Z', 'Zhang, B', 'Yang, M', 'Chen, S G', 'Hou, M', 'Wang, L X']","['Li GY', 'Liu JZ', 'Zhang B', 'Yang M', 'Chen SG', 'Hou M', 'Wang LX']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shangdong, PR China']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Adv Med Sci,Advances in medical sciences,101276222,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Albumins)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (SRI protein, human)', '0 (haishengsu)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Albumins/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bivalvia/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",,,2013/06/05 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2478/v10039-012-0069-8 [doi]', 'S1896-1126(14)60179-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Adv Med Sci. 2013;58(1):112-7. doi: 10.2478/v10039-012-0069-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE: A 3.8-year-old girl who had been treated for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for 1.5 years was admitted to our hospital with excessive weight gain and depression for the last 2 months. Prior to her admission, she was on maintenance with the ALL-BFM95 study protocol for 10 months that does not contain corticosteroids. On physical examination, central obesity and moon face appearance were determined. Laboratory tests revealed high morning ACTH, cortisol level, and 24-h urinary free cortisol level. Morning cortisol level was 33.94 nmol/L after a 2-day (4 x 0.5 mg) dexamethasone suppression test. A lumbar puncture revealed leukemic cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. No pituitary adenoma was detected on magnetic resonance imaging. We diagnosed the patient with ACTH-dependent CS related to leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system. CONCLUSION: Central nervous system infiltration should be considered in leukemic patients who have developed CS. We believe increased leukemia inhibitory factor levels may be a factor for CS in our patient with ALL.","['Sahin, Nursel Muratoglu', 'Avci, Zekai', 'Malbora, Baris', 'Abaci, Ayhan', 'Kinik, Sibel Tulgar', 'Ozbek, Namik Yasar']","['Sahin NM', 'Avci Z', 'Malbora B', 'Abaci A', 'Kinik ST', 'Ozbek NY']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology/psychology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/pathology/physiopathology/psychology/*secondary', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cushing Syndrome/*etiology/metabolism', 'Depression/etiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', '*Models, Biological', 'Obesity, Abdominal/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Weight Gain']",,,2013/06/05 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/jpem-2012-0401 [doi]', '/j/jpem.ahead-of-print/jpem-2012-0401/jpem-2012-0401.xml [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2013;26(9-10):967-70. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2012-0401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in children aged 0-10 years were identified. Controls were chosen at random from the local population in each region. Parents were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The collected data were blindly reviewed by expert industrial hygienists in order to estimate exposure to a list of agents. Statistical analyses were performed for each agent using unconditional multivariable logistic regression models, taking into account timing of exposure. RESULTS: 683 cases of acute childhood leukaemia, 97 cases of NHL and 1044 controls were identified. Increased risk of childhood leukaemia was found for maternal exposure to aliphatic (OR 4.3) or aromatic hydrocarbons (OR 3.8) in the preconception period, and for paternal exposure to diesel exhaust (OR 1.4), lead exposure (OR 1.7) and mineral oils (OR 1.4)[corrected]. Risk of NHL appeared to be related to paternal exposure to oxygenated solvents (OR 2.5) and petrol exhaust (OR 2.2). CONCLUSIONS: We found increased risk for childhood leukaemia associated with maternal occupational exposure to aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly in the preconception period; increased risks were also observed for paternal exposure to diesel exhaust fumes, mineral oils and lead. The risk of NHL appeared to be related to paternal exposure to oxygenated solvent and petrol exhausts.","['Miligi, Lucia', 'Benvenuti, Alessandra', 'Mattioli, Stefano', 'Salvan, Alberto', 'Tozzi, Giulio Andrea', 'Ranucci, Alessandra', 'Legittimo, Patrizia', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Bisanti, Luigi', 'Zambon, Paola', 'Cannizzaro, Santina', 'Kirchmayer, Ursula', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Celentano, Egidio', 'Assennato, Giorgio', 'Merlo, Domenico Franco', 'Mosciatti, Paola', 'Minelli, Liliana', 'Cuttini, Marina', 'Torregrossa, Valeria', 'Lagorio, Susanna', 'Haupt, Riccardo', 'Risica, Serena', 'Polichetti, Alessandro', 'Magnani, Corrado']","['Miligi L', 'Benvenuti A', 'Mattioli S', 'Salvan A', 'Tozzi GA', 'Ranucci A', 'Legittimo P', 'Rondelli R', 'Bisanti L', 'Zambon P', 'Cannizzaro S', 'Kirchmayer U', 'Cocco P', 'Celentano E', 'Assennato G', 'Merlo DF', 'Mosciatti P', 'Minelli L', 'Cuttini M', 'Torregrossa V', 'Lagorio S', 'Haupt R', 'Risica S', 'Polichetti A', 'Magnani C']","['Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, ISPO Cancer Prevention and Research Institute, Florence, Italy. l.miligi@ispo.toscana.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130601,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Hazardous Substances)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemical Industry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Hazardous Substances/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Distribution', 'Solvents/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2013/06/05 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2012-100951 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2012-100951 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2013 Sep;70(9):648-55. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2012-100951.

LPC significantly showed cytotoxicity at 80 muM and induced apoptosis by sub-G1 accumulation, increase in Annexin V positive and caspase activation. LPC enhanced histone H3 acetylation but decreased histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and HDAC3 expression. LPC also inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3, its DNA binding activity and nuclear co-localization of HDAC3 and STAT3. In addition, LPC effectively attenuated the expression of survival genes such as Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and survivin but did not affect COX-2 expression in K562 cells. Furthermore, LPC suppressed phosphorylation of Src and Janus activated kinase 2 while promoted the expression of tyrosine phosphatase Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1). Consistently, silencing SHP-1 and pervanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase, reversed inactivation of HDAC and STAT3, cleavages of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in LPC-induced apoptosis. Of note, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that LPC suppressed the binding of HDAC3 and STAT3 to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and survivin promoter. Overall, our findings indicate that inactivation of STAT3 and HDAC mediates LPC-induced apoptosis in CML K562 cells.","['Jung, Ji Hoon', 'Jeong, Soo-Jin', 'Kim, Ji-Hyun', 'Jung, Sung-Ki', 'Jung, Deok-Beom', 'Lee, Duckgu', 'Sohn, Eun Jung', 'Yun, Miyong', 'Lee, Hyo-Jung', 'Lee, Hyo-Jeong', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Jung JH', 'Jeong SJ', 'Kim JH', 'Jung SK', 'Jung DB', 'Lee D', 'Sohn EJ', 'Yun M', 'Lee HJ', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim SH']","['Cancer Preventive Material Development Research Center, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 131-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5655-17-4 (stearoyl alpha-lysolecithin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/*toxicity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12013-013-9670-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2013;67(3):1379-89. doi: 10.1007/s12013-013-9670-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a prerequisite for individualized cancer treatment, we sought to characterize the landscape of recurrent somatic mutations in HCC. We performed whole-exome sequencing on 87 HCCs and matched normal adjacent tissues to an average coverage of 59x. The overall mutation rate was roughly two mutations per Mb, with a median of 45 nonsynonymous mutations that altered the amino acid sequence (range, 2-381). We found recurrent mutations in several genes with high transcript levels: TP53 (18%); CTNNB1 (10%); KEAP1 (8%); C16orf62 (8%); MLL4 (7%); and RAC2 (5%). Significantly affected gene families include the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing family, calcium channel subunits, and histone methyltransferases. In particular, the MLL family of methyltransferases for histone H3 lysine 4 were mutated in 20% of tumors. CONCLUSION: The NFE2L2-KEAP1 and MLL pathways are recurrently mutated in multiple cohorts of HCC.","['Cleary, Sean P', 'Jeck, William R', 'Zhao, Xiaobei', 'Chen, Kui', 'Selitsky, Sara R', 'Savich, Gleb L', 'Tan, Ting-Xu', 'Wu, Michael C', 'Getz, Gad', 'Lawrence, Michael S', 'Parker, Joel S', 'Li, Jinyu', 'Powers, Scott', 'Kim, Hyeja', 'Fischer, Sandra', 'Guindi, Maha', 'Ghanekar, Anand', 'Chiang, Derek Y']","['Cleary SP', 'Jeck WR', 'Zhao X', 'Chen K', 'Selitsky SR', 'Savich GL', 'Tan TX', 'Wu MC', 'Getz G', 'Lawrence MS', 'Parker JS', 'Li J', 'Powers S', 'Kim H', 'Fischer S', 'Guindi M', 'Ghanekar A', 'Chiang DY']","['Department of Surgery, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['F30 AG041567/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA168409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA143845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24CA143845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130924,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KEAP1 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics', '*Exome', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC3830584,['NIHMS483459'],2013/06/04 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2012/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.26540 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2013 Nov;58(5):1693-702. doi: 10.1002/hep.26540.

Amongst these, Lactobacillus plantarum Lp91 was the most potent anti-inflammatory strain as it evoked a significant (P < 0.001) down-regulation of TNF-alpha by -1.45-fold relative to the control in THP-1 cells. However, in terms of IL-6 expression, all the strains could up-regulate its expression considerably at different levels. Hence, based on in vitro expression of TNF-alpha, Lp91 was selected for in vivo study in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model to look at the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and E-selectin in mouse aorta. In LPS challenged (2 h) mice group fed with Lp91 for 10 days, TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin expressions were significantly down-regulated by 3.10-, 10.02-, 4.22-, -3.14-, 2.28- and 5.71-fold relative to control conditions.

Both of the patients had symptoms of infection and anemia and were therefore treated with antibiotics and transfusions. The SR lasted for two months and one month, respectively. Currently, the mechanisms underlying SR remain ambiguous. Possible underlying mechanisms with a review of the related literature are discussed.","['Zeng, Qingchao', 'Yuan, Yan', 'Li, Pei', 'Chen, Tong']","['Zeng Q', 'Yuan Y', 'Li P', 'Chen T']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/02/14 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/52.9505 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.52.9505 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2013;52(11):1227-33. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.52.9505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wnt/catenin signaling is critical for the self-renewal of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Deregulated Wnt signaling is evident in chronic and acute myeloid leukemia; however, little is known about ALL. Differential interaction of catenin with either the Kat3 coactivator CREBBP (CREB-binding protein (CBP)) or the highly homologous EP300 (p300) is critical to determine divergent cellular responses and provides a rationale for the regulation of both proliferation and differentiation by the Wnt signaling pathway. Usage of the coactivator CBP by catenin leads to transcriptional activation of cassettes of genes that are involved in maintenance of progenitor cell self-renewal. However, the use of the coactivator p300 leads to activation of genes involved in the initiation of differentiation. ICG-001 is a novel small-molecule modulator of Wnt/catenin signaling, which specifically binds to the N-terminus of CBP and not p300, within amino acids 1-110, thereby disrupting the interaction between CBP and catenin. Here, we report that selective disruption of the CBP/beta- and gamma-catenin interactions using ICG-001 leads to differentiation of pre-B ALL cells and loss of self-renewal capacity. Survivin, an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein, was also downregulated in primary ALL after treatment with ICG-001. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrate occupancy of the survivin promoter by CBP that is decreased by ICG-001 in primary ALL. CBP mutations have been recently identified in a significant percentage of ALL patients, however, almost all of the identified mutations reported occur C-terminal to the binding site for ICG-001. Importantly, ICG-001, regardless of CBP mutational status and chromosomal aberration, leads to eradication of drug-resistant primary leukemia in combination with conventional therapy in vitro and significantly prolongs the survival of NOD/SCID mice engrafted with primary ALL. Therefore, specifically inhibiting CBP/catenin transcription represents a novel approach to overcome relapse in ALL.","['Gang, E J', 'Hsieh, Y-T', 'Pham, J', 'Zhao, Y', 'Nguyen, C', 'Huantes, S',

PLZF (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger protein), a member of the POK family of transcription factors, acts as an epigenetic regulator of stem cell maintenance in germ cells and haematopoietic stem cells. We identified L1 retrotransposons as the primary targets of PLZF. PLZF-mediated DNA methylation induces silencing of the full-length L1 gene and inhibits L1 retrotransposition. Furthermore, PLZF causes the formation of barrier-type boundaries by acting on inserted truncated L1 sequences in protein coding genes. Cell stress releases PLZF-mediated repression, resulting in L1 activation/retrotransposition and impaired spermatogenesis and myelopoiesis. These results reveal a novel mechanism of action by which, PLZF represses retrotransposons, safeguarding normal progenitor homeostasis.","['Puszyk, William', 'Down, Thomas', 'Grimwade, David', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Oakey, Rebecca J', 'Solomon, Ellen', 'Guidez, Fabien']","['Puszyk W', 'Down T', 'Grimwade D', 'Chomienne C', 'Oakey RJ', 'Solomon E', 'Guidez F']","[""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['085448/Z/08/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '084358/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/J006742/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '085448/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '084358/Z/07/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130531,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenomics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Germ Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3810588,['EMS55167'],2013/06/04 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2013118 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2013.118 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2013 Jul 3;32(13):1941-52. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2013.118.

It is an enzyme of bacterial origin capable of transforming L-asparagine to aspartic acid. The extracellular depletion of L-asparagine inhibits protein synthesis in lymphoblasts, inducing their apoptosis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment with L-ASP improves survival of patients, but there are clear differences in the characteristics of the three currently available formulations. This article reviews the dosage, activity and side effects of the two L-ASP derived from Escherichia coli (native and pegylated), and the one derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinia ASP). Despite its indisputable indication over the past50 years, there are still many points of contention, and its use is still marked by the side effects of the inhibition of protein synthesis. The short half-life of native forms, and the most frequently used parenteral administration by intramuscular injections, affects the quality of life of the patients. Therefore, recent studies claim to evaluate alternatives, such as the formulation of longer half-life pegylated L-ASP, and the use of intravenous formulations. There are encouraging results to date with both preparations. Still, further studies are needed to establish which should be the formulation and frontline indicated route of administration, optimal dosing, and management of adverse effects.","['Moscardo Guilleme, C', 'Fernandez Delgado, R', 'Sevilla Navarro, J', 'Astigarraga Aguirre, I', 'Rives Sola, S', 'Sanchez de Toledo Codina, J', 'Fuster Soler, J L', 'Parra Ramirez, L', 'Molina Garicano, J', 'Gonzalez Martinez, B', 'Madero Lopez, L']","['Moscardo Guilleme C', 'Fernandez Delgado R', 'Sevilla Navarro J', 'Astigarraga Aguirre I', 'Rives Sola S', 'Sanchez de Toledo Codina J', 'Fuster Soler JL', 'Parra Ramirez L', 'Molina Garicano J', 'Gonzalez Martinez B', 'Madero Lopez L']","['Hospital General Universitario, Alicante, Espana.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20130531,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1695-4033(13)00153-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anpedi.2013.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2013 Nov;79(5):329.e1-329.e11. doi: 10.1016/j.anpedi.2013.03.015.

We explored this issue in a mouse knockin model of gain-of-function Flt3-ITD mutation because FLT3-ITDs are paradoxically restricted to acute myeloid leukemia even though Flt3 primarily promotes lymphoid development during normal hematopoiesis. When expressed in MPPs, Flt3-ITD collaborated with Runx1 mutation to induce high-penetrance aggressive leukemias that were exclusively of the myeloid phenotype. Flt3-ITDs preferentially expanded MPPs with reduced lymphoid and increased myeloid transcriptional priming while compromising early B and T lymphopoiesis. Flt3-ITD-induced myeloid lineage bias involved upregulation of the transcription factor Pu.1, which is a direct target gene of Stat3, an aberrantly activated target of Flt3-ITDs, further establishing how lineage bias can be inflicted on MPPs through aberrant GFR signaling. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into how oncogenic mutations might subvert the normal process of lineage commitment and dictate the phenotype of resulting malignancies.","['Mead, Adam J', 'Kharazi, Shabnam', 'Atkinson, Deborah', 'Macaulay, Iain', 'Pecquet, Christian', 'Loughran, Stephen', 'Lutteropp, Michael', 'Woll, Petter', 'Chowdhury, Onima', 'Luc, Sidinh', 'Buza-Vidas, Natalija', 'Ferry, Helen', 'Clark, Sally-Ann', 'Goardon, Nicolas', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N', 'Sitnicka, Ewa', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W']","['Mead AJ', 'Kharazi S', 'Atkinson D', 'Macaulay I', 'Pecquet C', 'Loughran S', 'Lutteropp M', 'Woll P', 'Chowdhury O', 'Luc S', 'Buza-Vidas N', 'Ferry H', 'Clark SA', 'Goardon N', 'Vyas P', 'Constantinescu SN', 'Sitnicka E', 'Nerlov C', 'Jacobsen SE']","['Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK. adam.mead@imm.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['G84/6443/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12020/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U137961146/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0801073/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/5/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0501838/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000729/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900892/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130530,United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",PMC3701326,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-1247(13)00213-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.celrep.2013.04.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2013 Jun 27;3(6):1766-76. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2013.04.031.

Previous studies indicated its anti-leukemia effect but the potential mechanisms have not been fully explained. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The present study was further to investigate the underlying mechanism of ethyl acetate extract of Polytrichum commune L.ex Hedw (EEF)-induced toxicity and apoptosis in L1210 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Viability, DNA damage and apoptotic protein expressions of L1210 cells were analyzed by ViaCount, comet assay and western blot, respectively. At different times after EEF treatment, Bax redistribution in L1210 cells was examined using confocal microscopy; loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was monitored by fluorescence microscope using rhodamine 123 staining; Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA fragmentation were measured by flow cytometry using fluorescent dye, DCFH-DA and PI, respectively. RESULTS: EEF significantly inhibited L1210 cell survival, promoted Bax translocation onto mitochondria, stimulated caspase-9 activation and subsequent DNA damage in L1210 cells. Abundant ROS was detected in L1210 cells after EEF treatment, and the ROS scavenger NAC significantly relieved EEF-induced cell viability decline, MMP loss, and DNA fragmentation. CONCLUSION: EEF could induce mitochondria-dependent cell apoptosis in L1210 cells, and ROS may play an important role in this action.","['Cheng, Xiaoxia', 'Xiao, Yaping', 'Wang, Pan', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Zhou, Yuetao', 'Yan, Han', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Cheng X', 'Xiao Y', 'Wang P', 'Wang X', 'Zhou Y', 'Yan H', 'Liu Q']","[""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710062, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130529,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Solvents)', '76845O8NMZ (ethyl acetate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Acetates/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', '*Bryophyta', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Solvents/chemistry']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/02/01 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(13)00396-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2013.05.045 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2013 Jul 30;148(3):926-33. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2013.05.045.

Here, we explored the use of lipid-modified polyethylenimines (PEI) of low molecular weights (0.6, 1.2 and 2.0kDa) in K562 cells and showed that the delivery efficiency was dependent on the type of lipid used for polymer modification, degree of lipid substitution and polymer molecular weight. Among the lipid-substituted polymers investigated, palmitic acid (PA)-substituted 1.2kDa PEI (~2 lipids/PEI) has proven to be highly efficient in delivering siRNA and silencing of the reporter gene green fluorescent protein (GFP). The silencing efficacy achieved with this polymer was found to be higher than the 25kDa PEI and is similar to commercial reagent Lipofectamine 2000. Moreover, when BCR-ABL protein was targeted in K562 cells, a reduction in the corresponding mRNA levels was observed, as well as an induction of early and late stage apoptosis. The results of this study demonstrated that PA-substitutions on low MW polymers could be useful for siRNA delivery in CML cells for therapeutic purposes.","['Valencia-Serna, Juliana', 'Gul-Uludag, Hilal', 'Mahdipoor, Parvin', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Uludag, Hasan']","['Valencia-Serna J', 'Gul-Uludag H', 'Mahdipoor P', 'Jiang X', 'Uludag H']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2V2, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130528,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Polyethyleneimine/*chemistry', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Transfection/*methods']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(13)00304-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.05.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2013 Dec 10;172(2):495-503. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.05.014.

Rac1 belongs to the small GTP-binding protein superfamily and is implicated in the interactions of hematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow niche. Our previous studies have shown that Rac1 is over-expressed in leukemia patients and activation of Rac1 GTPase is closely associated with the efficient migration of leukemia cells. However, the potential functions for Rac1 GTPase in LSCs behaviors and in the residence of leukemia cells in niche remain unknown. In this study, by forced expression of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 GTPase in a CD34(+) myeloid leukemia cell line, as well as bone marrow cells from leukemia patients, we show that inactivation of Rac1 GTPase causes impaired migration and enhances chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Inactivation of Rac1 in leukemia cells also lead to a reduction in the frequency of cells in quiescent state and inhibition of homing to bone marrow niche. Gene expression analysis shows that inactivation of Rac1 down-regulates the expression of several cell intrinsic cell cycle inhibitors such as p21, p27, and p57, as well as the extrinsic molecules that mediated the interaction of LSC with osteoblastic niche. Furthermore, we show that Rac1 mediated the localization in niche is further attributed to the maintenance of quiescence. Our results provide evidence for the critical role of Rac1 GTPase in leukemia cell chemotherapy resistance, quiescence maintenance and the interaction with bone marrow microenvironment.","['Wang, Ji-Ying', 'Yu, Pei', 'Chen, Shuying', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Chen, Yirui', 'Wang, Min', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Wang JY', 'Yu P', 'Chen S', 'Xing H', 'Chen Y', 'Wang M', 'Tang K', 'Tian Z', 'Rao Q', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130515,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5528460,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/04/20 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1574-7891(13)00080-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.molonc.2013.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2013 Oct;7(5):907-16. doi: 10.1016/j.molonc.2013.05.001.

We identified anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody immunoliposomes (ILs) as vehicles for targeted delivery to B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. To achieve maximal benefits for all patients, a new strategy of dual-ligand immunoliposomes (dILs) was developed. A combinatorial antibody microarray technology was adapted to quickly identify optimal antibody combinations for individual patient cells. For proof-of-concept, a B-cell specific antibody, either anti-CD19 or anti-CD20, was combined with anti-CD37 to construct dILs with enhanced selectivity and efficacy. Consistent with data from the antibody microarray, these dILs provided highly specific targeting to both leukemia cell lines and B-CLL patient cells. Compared with the single antibody ILs, the anti-CD19/CD37 dILs clearly demonstrated superior delivery efficiency and apoptosis induction to B-CLL patient cells, whereas the anti-CD20/anti-CD37 dILs were found to be the most efficient for delivery to leukemia cell lines. In addition, it was observed that anti-CD37 ILs without payload drug mediated effective CD37 cross-linking and induced potent apoptosis induction. The anti-CD19/CD20 dILs showed the improved cell apoptosis induction compared to either anti-CD19 ILs or anti-CD20 ILs. Our findings suggest that the dual-ligand ILs may provide a preferred strategy of personalized nanomedicine for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.","['Yu, Bo', 'Mao, Yicheng', 'Yuan, Yuan', 'Yue, Chaofang', 'Wang, Xinmei', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Paulaitis, Michael E', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lee, L James', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan']","['Yu B', 'Mao Y', 'Yuan Y', 'Yue C', 'Wang X', 'Mo X', 'Jarjoura D', 'Paulaitis ME', 'Lee RJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Lee LJ', 'Muthusamy N']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA159296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130528,Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (Tetraspanins)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Liposomes/*immunology', 'Propylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tetraspanins/*immunology']",PMC3756150,['NIHMS490750'],2013/06/04 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0142-9612(13)00537-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.063 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2013 Aug;34(26):6185-93. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.063.

In fact, multiples allergic, toxic and infectious manifestations are more reported in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. The objective of our study was to analyse the epidemiological, mycological and clinical features of fusariosis reported in our CHU. Eighty-seven cases of Fusarium infections were collected: 34 cases of onychomycosis (39%), 26 cases of intertrigos (30%), 25 cases of keratomycosis (29%), one case of atypical invasive fusariosis due to Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC) and one case of localized gingivolabial fusariosis due to Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) in a patient with leukemia in phase of deep bone marrow aplasia, whose outcome was favorable after exiting of aplasia period and a treatment by amphotericine B. The case of pseudotumoral cutaneous fusariosis to F. oxysporum complicated with osteolysis and septic arthritis occurred in a pregnant woman without any immune deficit. The evolution was fatal in spite of prescription of multiple systemic antifungals. Concerning keratomycosis, Fusarium was the first agent responsible for these infections (43%). The corneal traumatism was found in 37.5% of cases and FSSC was the most isolated (72%). For superficial dermatomycosis, Fusarium was the third agent of onychomycosis in molds (25%). The most isolated species were FSSC (68%) and FOSC (20%). The intertrigo frequency was 0.07% and they were mostly caused by FSSC (84%) and FOSC (16%). Fusarium is an important cause of mold infections in our region. So, the species identification is useful because some species are resistant to the most common systemic antifungal agents.","['Neji, S', 'Trabelsi, H', 'Cheikhrouhou, F', 'Sellami, H', 'Guidara, R', 'Trigui, A', 'Feki, J', 'Boudaya, S', 'Turki, H', 'Makni, F', 'Ayadi, A']","['Neji S', 'Trabelsi H', 'Cheikhrouhou F', 'Sellami H', 'Guidara R', 'Trigui A', 'Feki J', 'Boudaya S', 'Turki H', 'Makni F', 'Ayadi A']","['Laboratoire de biologie moleculaire parasitaire et fongique, faculte de medecine, rue Magida Boulila, 3029 Sfax, Tunisie.']",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20130530,France,J Mycol Med,Journal de mycologie medicale,9425651,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques/statistics & numerical data', 'Corneal Ulcer/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Eye Infections, Fungal/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Fusariosis/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*microbiology/therapy', 'Hospitals, University/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Onychomycosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tunisia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/07/02 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1156-5233(13)00027-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mycmed.2013.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mycol Med. 2013 Jun;23(2):130-5. doi: 10.1016/j.mycmed.2013.04.003.

METHODS: Western blot, flow cytometry and cell viability assays were used to investigate the effects of hypoxia (1% O2) on cell proliferation, drug resistance and expression of the hypoxia inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha), the octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), CD133, CD34 and the ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) as well as Smad2 phosphorylation in the drug resistant cell line K562/DOX and its parental cell line. RESULTS: Hypoxia induced growth inhibition and significantly upregulated HIF-2alpha, CD133, Oct4, CD34 and ABCG2 expression in the wild type K562 cells (p<0.05). The IC50 of doxorubicin was also enhanced about 2.5-fold in hypoxia. In contrast, the K562/DOX cells, which showed significantly higher ABCG2 expression and IC50 for various drugs, no significant difference in cell proliferation was observed between hypoxia and normoxia. The hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF-2alpha, CD133, Oct4, CD34 and ABCG2 expression was significantly lower than in the wild type cells (p<0.05). Moreover, hypoxia induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and additional treatment with SD-208, an inhibitor of the TGF-beta receptor I kinase, resulted in a dose-dependent downregulation of CD133 and Oct4 in the K562/DOX cells. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia plays an important role in enhancing the stem cell-like properties and to induce multidrug resistance of leukemia cells. The activation of the TGF-beta/Smad2 signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of this pathophysiological process.","['Cui, Xue Yan', 'Skretting, Grethe', 'Jing, Ying', 'Sun, Hui', 'Sandset, Per Morten', 'Sun, Ling']","['Cui XY', 'Skretting G', 'Jing Y', 'Sun H', 'Sandset PM', 'Sun L']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. x.y.cui@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130529,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad2 Protein/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2012/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(13)00116-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2013.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2013 Oct;51(3):177-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2013.05.003.

We investigated the role of RNaseL in counteracting Friend retrovirus (FV) infection relative to a well-described restriction factor, Apobec3. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and RNaseL knock-out (KO) mice exhibited similar acute FV infection levels despite significant transcriptional induction of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, which produces activators of RNase L. Apobec3 KO mice showed higher FV infection levels relative to WT mice, but deletion of RNaseL in Apobec3 KO mice did not augment FV infection. Moreover, RNaseL did not influence FV-specific IgG responses and recovery from viremia by 28 days post-infection.

METHOD: The qualitative descriptive approach was selected in order to obtain rich content by exploring of individual perceptions related to the experiences of primary nursing. Focus group interviews were used with staff and individual interviews with the parents. Data from different participants were analysed together by using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Primary nursing was revealed as a confused and unstructured tradition which allowed variation in the role of the primary nurse and in the process. Within the role of a primary nurse, the orientation to primary nursing varied consisting of coordinating of care, task orientated and relation orientated primary nursing. The starting of the process was sudden and accidental by nature involving the aspects of commencement and allocation of the process. At the end of the process different emphasis existed in terms of the length of the process as highlighting early phase, comprehensive process and never getting to the end. Staff notions varied more than those of the parents. CONCLUSION: Perceptions related to primary nursing as a working model were revealed to be confusing by nature from the point of view of all involved. Thus, clarification is needed in the role of primary nurses and the process of primary nursing in order to gain expected family and organisational outcomes.","['Korhonen, Anne', 'Kangasniemi, Mari']","['Korhonen A', 'Kangasniemi M']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescence, Oulu University Hospital, P.O.

As a deubiquitination enzyme, CYLD regulates the proliferation, development and activation of lymphoid cells. Here we determined the CYLD mRNA expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 125 patients with CLL. CYLD was considerably down-regulated in CLL cells compared to normal B cells. Low CYLD expression was associated with unmutated status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IGHV) gene (p = 0.0018) and CD38 positivity (p = 0.0499). Patients with high CYLD expression showed a trend toward improved overall survival (OS) (10-year OS: CYLD high: 94.74%, CYLD low: 52.71%; p = 0.0534). For patients with mutated IGHV gene, high CYLD was also associated with better OS (10-year OS: CYLD high: 100%, CYLD low: 66.67%; p = 0.0547). In conclusion, low CYLD expression identifies a subgroup of patients with CLL with inferior outcome, indicating the role of CYLD as a tumor suppressor in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Wu, Wei', 'Zhu, Huayuan', 'Fu, Yuan', 'Shen, Wenyi', 'Xu, Jiadai', 'Miao, Kourong', 'Hong, Ming', 'Xu, Wei', 'Liu, Peng', 'Li, Jianyong']","['Wu W', 'Zhu H', 'Fu Y', 'Shen W', 'Xu J', 'Miao K', 'Hong M', 'Xu W', 'Liu P', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University , Nanjing , P.R.

We aimed to study the frequency of CYP1A1 allelic variants in Egyptian patients with ALL, to evaluate their role in the development of ALL and to correlate these allelic variants with clinical and biological characteristics of the patients. Polymorphism of CYP1A1*2A, *2B and *4 alleles was examined in 186 Egyptian children with ALL and 200 normal individuals using polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). A higher prevalence of the CYP1A1*4 allele was found in patients with ALL than in the normal population (19.4%vs. 10.0%, odds ratio [OR] = 2.160, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.200-3.89, p = 0.01), especially in the homozygous variant (OR = 6.6, 95% CI = 2.23-19.58, p = 0.001) and in male patients (p = 0.005), particularly those aged 2-10 years (OR = 5.214, 95% CI = 1.535-17.706, p = 0.008). CYP1A1*2A showed a significant difference between age groups (p = 0.046), with a higher incidence in the 10-17-year-old group (21.1%). Multivariate analysis showed that only the CYP1A1*4 allele remained as a probable independent risk factor for ALL development (OR = 2.250, 95% CI = 1.244-4.069; p = 0.007). Our results suggest that polymorphic variants in the CYP1A1*4 gene may increase the risk of childhood ALL, particularly in male patients aged 2-10 years.","['Agha, Adel', 'Shabaan, Howyda', 'Abdel-Gawad, Eman', 'El-Ghannam, Doaa']","['Agha A', 'Shabaan H', 'Abdel-Gawad E', 'El-Ghannam D']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University , Banha , Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130715,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sex Distribution']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.809527 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Mar;55(3):618-23. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.809527.

Different processes are involved in its pathogenesis, such as (epi)genetic alterations and immunological dysfunctions. The nature of immune dysregulation is markedly different between various MDS risk groups. In low-risk MDS, the immune system is in a proinflammatory state, whereas in high-risk disease, immunosuppressive features facilitate expansion of the dysplastic clone and can eventually lead to disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Various cell types contribute to dysregulation of immune responses in MDS. Dendritic cells (DCs) are important regulators of immunity. However, the role of DCs in MDS has yet to be elucidated. It has been suggested that impaired DC function can hamper adequate immune responses. This review focuses on the involvement of DCs in immune dysregulation in low- and high-risk MDS and the implications for DC-targeted therapies.","['Kerkhoff, Nathalie', 'Bontkes, Hetty J', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'Kordasti, Shahram', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Kerkhoff N', 'Bontkes HJ', 'Westers TM', 'de Gruijl TD', 'Kordasti S', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. n.kerkhoff@vumc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/*therapy']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/imt.13.51 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2013 Jun;5(6):621-37. doi: 10.2217/imt.13.51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study explored inhibitory effects of BITC on human glioma U87MG cells, as well as potential mechanisms. It was found that BITC could inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and arrest cell cycling of U87MG cells. In addition, it inhibited the expression of SOD and GSH, and caused oxidative stress to tumor cells. Therefore, it is believed that BITC can inhibit the growth of U87MG cells outside the body.

IL-10 mRNA expression in incipient AML patients was obvious higher than the non- tumor group and the remission group (7.78?10-3 vs 2.43?10-3, 3.64?10-3, P<0.05).The study suggested that the haploid TA and genotype TA/TA may be associated with AML in Han people in Hunan province.The IL-10 SNPs at -819 and -592 sites were associated with AML and may affect IL-10 mRNA expression in AML patients.","['Yao, Chen-Jiao', 'Du, Wei', 'Chen, Hai-Bing', 'Xiao, Sheng', 'Wang, Cheng-Hong', 'Fan, Zi-Li']","['Yao CJ', 'Du W', 'Chen HB', 'Xiao S', 'Wang CH', 'Fan ZL']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'DNA Primers/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', 'Haploidy', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.4.2439 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(4):2439-42. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.4.2439.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data on newly diagnosed (incident) leukemia and MM cases were obtained from collected from Golestan population-based cancer registry. Data was entered into CanReg-4 software. Age standardized incidence rates (ASR) (per 100000 person-years) for leukemia and MM were calculated. Data on Golestan population was obtained from the data of Iranian national census in 2006. RESULTS: Totally, 11036 new cancer cases were registered in GPRC from 2004-2009. Leukemia and MM accounted for 693 and 124 of cases, respectively. The mean age in patients with leukemia and MM was 43.8 and 62.4 years, respectively. The ASRs for leukemia among men and women were 10.4 and 7.8, respectively (p<0.001). The ASRs for MM were 2.1 and 2 in men and women, respectively (p=0.93). The rate of leukemia was significantly higher in rural areas (p=0.02) whereas the incidence of MM was higher in urban areas (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a high incidence rate of leukemia in Golestan province of Iran. The incidence of leukemia was significantly higher in males and residents of rural areas. High exposure to pesticides and other agricultural related products may be a possible explanation for epidemiological pattern of leukemia in this area. Determining and controlling important risk factors, especially environmental factors, of leukemia may lead to decrease in its burden in Golestan province of Iran.","['Rajabli, Niloofar', 'Naeimi-Tabeie, Mohammad', 'Jahangirrad, Ataollah', 'Sedaghat, Seyed-Mehdi', 'Semnani, Shahryar', 'Roshandel, Gholamreza']","['Rajabli N', 'Naeimi-Tabeie M', 'Jahangirrad A', 'Sedaghat SM', 'Semnani S', 'Roshandel G']","['Golestan Research Center of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.4.2333 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(4):2333-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.4.2333.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study 294 acute leukemia cases, comprising 152 of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 142 of acute myeloid leukemia, and 251 control samples were analyzed for GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms through multiplex PCR methods. Significantly increased frequencies of GSTM1 null genotype (M0), GSTT1 null genotype (T0) and GST double null genotype (T0M0) were observed in the both ALL and AML cases as compared to controls. When data were analyzed with respect to clinical variables, increased mean levels of WBC, Blast %, LDH and significant reduction in DFS were observed in both ALL and AML cases with T0 genotype. In conclusion, absence of both GST M and GST T might confer increased risk of developing ALL or AML. The absence of GST enzyme might lead to oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage resulting in genomic instability, a hallmark of acute leukemia. The GST enzyme deficiency might also exert impact on clinical prognosis leading to poorer DFS. Hence GST genotyping can be made mandatory in management of acute leukemia so that more aggressive therapy such as allogenic stem cell transplantation may be planned in the case of patients with a null genotype.","['Dunna, Nageswara Rao', 'Vure, Sugunakar', 'Sailaja, K', 'Surekha, D', 'Raghunadharao, D', 'Rajappa, Senthil', 'Vishnupriya, S']","['Dunna NR', 'Vure S', 'Sailaja K', 'Surekha D', 'Raghunadharao D', 'Rajappa S', 'Vishnupriya S']","['School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA University, Thanjavur, India.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.4.2221 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(4):2221-4. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.4.2221.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because miR levels are deregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 is constitutively activated in CLL, we sought to determine whether STAT3 affects the transcription of miR genes in CLL cells. METHODS: We used publically available data from the ENCODE project to identify putative STAT3 binding sites in the promoters of miR genes. Then we transfected CLL cells with STAT3-shRNA or with an empty vector, and to determine which miRs are differentially expressed, we used a miR microarray approach followed by validation of the microarray results for 6 miRs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: We identified putative STAT3 binding sites in 160 promoter regions of 200 miRs, including miR-21, miR-29, and miR-155, whose levels have been reported to be upregulated in CLL. Levels of 72 miRs were downregulated (n = 63) or upregulated (n = 9). qRT-PCR confirmed the array data in 5 of 6 miRs.

An increasing number of studies indicate that melatonin protects normal cells, while it reducing cancer cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on the growth of the human leukemia cells and found that it efficiently reduced the number of cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Thus, incubation with the indoleamine increased the percentage of cells with a hypodiploid DNA content, augmented the number of annexin V-positive cells, and also provoked ultrastructural changes that are features of apoptotic cell death. Evaluation of caspases revealed that caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, and caspase-9, but not caspase-8 and caspase-2, were quickly activated (3-6 hr). The increase in the activity of these proteases was associated with up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax and also with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Pretreatment of the cells with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, reduced melatonin-induced apoptosis, but it did not block cell death suggesting that melatonin activates an alternative cell death modality in the absence of caspase activity. Thus, the activation of caspases was preceded by a fast (<30 min) increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Rotenone and antimycin A reduced the levels of ROS stimulated by melatonin, indicating that the complex I and the complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain are important sources of these chemical species. However, the role of ROS in melatonin-induced cell death remains elusive because anti-oxidants that were shown to decrease ROS levels (glutathione, N-acetyl-l-cysteine and Trolox) were unable to abrogate melatonin-induced cell death.","['Perdomo, Juan', 'Cabrera, Javier', 'Estevez, Francisco', 'Loro, Juan', 'Reiter, Russel J', 'Quintana, Jose']","['Perdomo J', 'Cabrera J', 'Estevez F', 'Loro J', 'Reiter RJ', 'Quintana J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Fisiologia, Genetica e Inmunologia, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130601,England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 9/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Melatonin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2013/06/04 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jpi.12062 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2013 Sep;55(2):195-206. doi: 10.1111/jpi.12062.

The importance of promptly diagnosing and treating this disease in pregnancy stems from its life-threatening potential, both to the mother and fetus. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of relapse of acute myeloid leukemia at 23 weeks of pregnancy in a 24-year-old Albanian woman. Our patient categorically refused chemotherapy treatment, and in her 35th week of gestation, severe hemorrhagic diathesis rapidly developed. The manifestation and course of this life-threatening complication posed therapeutic challenges for the attending medical team. CONCLUSION: Based both on our experience and the results of other gynecological studies, there exists a strong indication that the earlier a patient's chemotherapy treatment begins, the better the maternal outcome. We support chemotherapy for patients who are pregnant presenting with such illness. The present case report testifies that refusal of chemotherapy by such patients is a high-risk decision.","['Hoxha, Syheda Latifi', 'Ibishi, Vlora Ademi', 'Brovina, Ahmet', 'Hoxha, Mynevere', 'Lulaj, Shefqet']","['Hoxha SL', 'Ibishi VA', 'Brovina A', 'Hoxha M', 'Lulaj S']","['Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, University Clinical Center of Kosova, Prishtina, 10000, Kosova. drsyheda@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130531,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC3679992,,2013/06/04 06:00,2013/06/04 06:01,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2012/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/04 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-7-148 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-7-148 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2013 May 31;7:148. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-7-148.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show evidence for the existence of minor but highly expanded unrelated B-cell clones in patients with MM defined by their complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) peak. We further characterize these clones over the disease and subsequent treatment. Second clones were identified by their specific IgH-VDJ sequences that are distinct from those of dominant MM clones. Clonal frequencies were determined through semi-quantitative PCR, quantitative PCR and single-cell polymerase chain reaction of the clone-specific sequence. In 13/74 MM patients, more than one dominant CDR3 peak was identified with 12 patients (16%) being truly biclonal. Second clones had different frequencies, were found in different locations and were found in different cell types from the dominant MM clone. Where analysis was possible, they were shown to have chromosomal characteristic distinct from those of the MM clone. The frequency of the second clone also changed over the course of the disease and often persisted despite treatment. Molecularly-defined second clones are infrequent in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS, 1/43 individuals or 2%), suggesting that they may arise at relatively late stages of myelomagenesis. In further support of our findings, biclonal gammopathy and concomitant MM and CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) were confirmed to originate from two unrelated clones. Our data supports the idea that the clone giving rise to symptomatic myeloma exerts clonal dominance to prevent expansion of other clones. MM and second clones may arise from an underlying niche permissive of clonal expansion. The clinical significance of these highly expanded but unrelated clones remains to be confirmed. Overall, our findings add new dimensions to evaluating related and unrelated clonal expansions in MM and the impact of disease evolution and treatment on clonal diversity.","['Kriangkum, Jitra', 'Motz, Sarah N', 'Debes Marun, Carina S', 'Lafarge, Sandrine T', 'Gibson, Spencer B', 'Venner, Christopher P', 'Johnston, James B', 'Belch, Andrew R', 'Pilarski, Linda M']","['Kriangkum J', 'Motz SN', 'Debes Marun CS', 'Lafarge ST', 'Gibson SB', 'Venner CP', 'Johnston JB', 'Belch AR', 'Pilarski LM']","['Department of Oncology, Cross Cancer Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130528,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/chemistry/immunology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*pathology', 'V(D)J Recombination/immunology']",PMC3665682,,2013/06/01 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0064927 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-33152 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 28;8(5):e64927. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064927.

To understand its roles during ontogeny and immunity, we analyzed its mRNA expression pattern by in situ hybridization and generated MLF1-IP gene knockout (KO) mice. MLF1-IP was expressed at elevated levels in most rudimentary tissues during the mid-gestation stage, between embryonic day 9.5 (e9.5) and e15.5. It declined afterwards in these tissues, but was very high in the testes and ovaries in adulthood. At post-natal day 10 (p10), the retina and cerebellum still expressed moderate MLF1-IP levels, although these tissues do not contain fast-proliferating cells at this stage. MLF1-IP expression in lymphoid organs, such as the thymus, lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow, was high between e15.5 and p10, and decreased in adulthood. MLF1-IP KO embryos failed to develop beyond e6.5. On the other hand, MLF1-IP(+/-) mice were alive and fertile, with no obvious anomalies. Lymphoid organ size, weight, cellularity and cell sub-populations in MLF1-IP(+/-) mice were in the normal range. The functions of MLF1-IP(+/-) T cells and naive CD4 cells, in terms of TCR-stimulated proliferation and Th1, Th17 and Treg cell differentiation in vitro, were comparable to those of wild type T cells. Our study demonstrates that MLF1-IP performs unique functions during mouse embryonic development, particularly around e6.5, when there was degeneration of epiblasts.

The firm white nodules were located at the base of unilateral uterine horns and were approximately 6 mm and 4 mm in diameter. Histopathologically, the nodules were composed of three areas, each with a distinct type of proliferating cells: large epithelioid decidual cells with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (antimesometrial region); compact spindle-shaped cells with oval nuclei and vacuolar cytoplasm (transitional region); and pleomorphic and spiny cells with round to oval nuclei and compact eosinophilic cytoplasm (mesometrial region). These cells proliferated in sheet-like arrangements and transformed into the other types of cells located in surrounding regions. Immunohistochemically, proliferating cells in all regions were strongly positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The proliferating cells were positive for vimentin, and large decidual cells were positive for common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen 10, a marker of uterine interstitial cells. Large decidual cells were positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin and desmin, suggesting differentiation into muscular cells. Progesterone receptor was expressed in all cell types; however, estrogen receptor alpha was not expressed in the antimesometrial region. These extremely rare tumor-like nodules represent nonneoplastic lesions referred as decidual reactions of endometrial interstitial cells, and their biological behavior is that of a space-occupying benign tumor in young rats. Our cases might provide information as a historical control in toxicity and pharmacological studies in rats.","['Yoshizawa, Katsuhiko', 'Emoto, Yuko', 'Kinoshita, Yuichi', 'Kimura, Ayako', 'Uehara, Norihisa', 'Yuri, Takashi', 'Shikata, Nobuaki', 'Tsubura, Airo']","['Yoshizawa K', 'Emoto Y', 'Kinoshita Y', 'Kimura A', 'Uehara N', 'Yuri T', 'Shikata N', 'Tsubura A']","['Department of Pathology II, Kansai Medical University, 10-15 Fumizono, Moriguchi, Osaka 570-8506, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130422,Japan,J Toxicol Pathol,Journal of toxicologic pathology,9306408,,,,PMC3620216,,2013/06/01 06:00,2013/06/01 06:01,['2013/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1293/tox.26.61 [doi]', '2012-0041 [pii]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Pathol. 2013 Mar;26(1):61-6. doi: 10.1293/tox.26.61.

We conducted a meta-analysis of published cohort and case-control studies exploring occupational TCE exposure in relation to five different lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, N=24), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL, N=13), multiple myeloma (MM, N=11), leukaemia (N=12) and chronic/small lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL/SLL, N=7). Studies published between 1950 and 2011 were identified through a PubMed Medline search. All studies included in analyses were classified as those that assessed either occupational TCE exposure specifically ('TCE-exposure' studies) or a broader classification of all chlorinated solvents ('chlorinated solvent-exposure' studies). A significantly raised summary estimate for NHL was seen for all cohort and case-control 'TCE-exposure' studies combined (N=19; relative risk (RR)=1.32, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.54; I(2)=25.20; p-heterogeneity=0.12) and for cohort 'TCE-exposure' studies (N=10; RR=1.52, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.79; I(2)=7.09; p-heterogeneity=0.63). A non-significant but raised summary estimate was seen for NHL case-control 'TCE-exposure' studies. No significant association with NHL risk was detected overall for any 'chlorinated solvent-exposure' studies. Summary estimates for occupational TCE exposure were not associated with risk of HL, MM, leukaemia or CLL/SLL. Our updated meta-analysis of NHL, which incorporates new analytical results from three cohort and four case-control studies, supports an association between occupational TCE exposure and NHL.","['Karami, Sara', 'Bassig, Bryan', 'Stewart, Patricia A', 'Lee, Kyoung-Mu', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Moore, Lee E', 'Lan, Qing']","['Karami S', 'Bassig B', 'Stewart PA', 'Lee KM', 'Rothman N', 'Moore LE', 'Lan Q']","['Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland 20852, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20130530,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Solvents)', '290YE8AR51 (Trichloroethylene)']",IM,"['*Carcinogens', 'Hodgkin Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Solvents/*toxicity', 'Trichloroethylene/*toxicity']",,,2013/06/01 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/06/01 06:00'],"['2013/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2012-101212 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2012-101212 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2013 Aug;70(8):591-9. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2012-101212.

The BCL2 inhibitor ABT-263 (navitoclax) is active in clinical trials for lymphoid malignancies, yet resistance is expected on the basis of preclinical models. We recently showed that vinblastine can dramatically sensitize several leukemia cell lines to ABT-737 (the experimental congener of ABT-263). The goal of these experiments was to determine the impact of vinblastine on ABT-737 sensitivity in CLL cells isolated from peripheral blood and to define the underlying mechanism. Freshly isolated CLL cells from 35 patients, as well as normal lymphocytes and platelets, were incubated with various microtubule-disrupting agents plus ABT-737 to assess sensitivity to the single agents and the combination. ABT-737 and vinblastine displayed a range of sensitivity as single agents, and vinblastine markedly sensitized all CLL samples to ABT-737 within six hours. Vinblastine potently induced the proapoptotic protein PMAIP1 (NOXA) in both time- and dose-dependent manner and this was required for the observed apoptosis. Combretastatin A4, which dissociates microtubules by binding to a different site, had the same effect, confirming that interaction of these agents with microtubules is the initial target. Similarly, vincristine and vinorelbine induced NOXA and enhanced CLL sensitivity to ABT-737. Furthermore, vinblastine plus ABT-737 overcame stroma-mediated resistance to ABT-737 alone. Apoptosis was induced with clinically achievable concentrations with no additional toxicity to normal lymphocytes or platelets. These results suggest that vinca alkaloids may improve the clinical efficacy of ABT-263 in patients with CLL.","['Bates, Darcy J P', 'Danilov, Alexey V', 'Lowrey, Christopher H', 'Eastman, Alan']","['Bates DJ', 'Danilov AV', 'Lowrey CH', 'Eastman A']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, USA.']",['eng'],"['3P30CA023108-31S4/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130530,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology/toxicity']",PMC3742582,['NIHMS487706'],2013/06/01 06:00,2014/04/02 06:00,['2013/06/01 06:00'],"['2013/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-1197 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1197 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 Aug;12(8):1504-14. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1197.

Although the genetic determinants underlying disease onset remain unclear, epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation are suggested to contribute significantly to leukemogenesis. Using the Illumina 450K array, we assessed DNA methylation in matched tumor-normal samples of 46 childhood patients with pre-B ALL, extending single CpG-site resolution analysis of the pre-B ALL methylome beyond CpG-islands (CGI). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of CpG-site neighborhood, gene, or microRNA (miRNA) gene-associated methylation levels separated the tumor cohort according to major pre-B ALL subtypes, and methylation in CGIs, CGI shores, and in regions around the transcription start site was found to significantly correlate with transcript expression. Focusing on samples carrying the t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, we identified 119 subtype-specific high-confidence marker CpG-loci. Pathway analyses linked the CpG-loci-associated genes with hematopoiesis and cancer. Further integration with whole-transcriptome data showed the effects of methylation on expression of 17 potential drivers of leukemogenesis. Independent validation of array methylation and sequencing-derived transcript expression with Sequenom Epityper technology and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, respectively, indicates more than 80% empirical accuracy of our genome-wide findings. In summary, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling enabled us to separate pre-B ALL according to major subtypes, to map epigenetic biomarkers specific for the t(12;21) subtype, and through a combined methylome and transcriptome approach to identify downstream effects on candidate drivers of leukemogenesis.","['Busche, Stephan', 'Ge, Bing', 'Vidal, Ramon', 'Spinella, Jean-Francois', 'Saillour, Virginie', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Chen, Shu-Huang', 'Droit, Arnaud', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Pastinen, Tomi']","['Busche S', 'Ge B', 'Vidal R', 'Spinella JF', 'Saillour V', 'Richer C', 'Healy J', 'Chen SH', 'Droit A', 'Sinnett D', 'Pastinen T']","['Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130530,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenomics/*methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site', '*Transcriptome']",,,2013/06/01 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/06/01 06:00'],"['2013/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-4367 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4367 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jul 15;73(14):4323-36. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4367.

PML-RARalpha disrupts the discrete nuclear speckles termed nuclear bodies, which are formed in PML, suggesting that nuclear body disruption is involved in leukemogenesis. Nuclear body formation that relies upon PML oligomerization and its stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible protein kinase (HIPK)-2 is disrupted by expression of the PML-RARalpha chimera. Here, we report that disruption of nuclear bodies is also mediated by PML-RARalpha inhibition of PML oligomerization. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PML-RARalpha blocked its ability to inhibit PML oligomerization and destabilize HIPK2.

Several protein components function in NHEJ, and of these, DNA Ligase IV is essential for performing the final 'end-joining' step. Mutations in DNA Ligase IV result in LIG4 syndrome, which is characterised by growth defects, microcephaly, reduced number of blood cells, increased predisposition to leukaemia and variable degrees of immunodeficiency. In this manuscript, we report the creation of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of LIG4 deficiency, which accurately replicates the DSB repair phenotype of LIG4 patients. Our findings demonstrate that impairment of NHEJ-mediated-DSB repair in human iPSC results in accumulation of DSBs and enhanced apoptosis, thus providing new insights into likely mechanisms used by pluripotent stem cells to maintain their genomic integrity. Defects in NHEJ-mediated-DSB repair also led to a significant decrease in reprogramming efficiency of human cells and accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting a key role for NHEJ in somatic cell reprogramming and providing insights for future cell based therapies for applications of LIG4-iPSCs. Although haematopoietic specification of LIG4-iPSC is not affected per se, the emerging haematopoietic progenitors show a high accumulation of DSBs and enhanced apoptosis, resulting in reduced numbers of mature haematopoietic cells. Together our findings provide new insights into the role of NHEJ-mediated-DSB repair in the survival and differentiation of progenitor cells, which likely underlies the developmental abnormalities observed in many DNA damage disorders. In addition, our findings are important for understanding how genomic instability arises in pluripotent stem cells and for defining appropriate culture conditions that restrict DNA damage and result in ex vivo expansion of stem cells with intact genomes.","['Tilgner, K', 'Neganova, I', 'Moreno-Gimeno, I', 'Al-Aama, J Y', 'Burks, D', 'Yung, S', 'Singhapol, C', 'Saretzki, G', 'Evans, J', 'Gorbunova, V', 'Gennery, A', 'Przyborski, S', 'Stojkovic, M', 'Armstrong, L', 'Jeggo, P', 'Lako, M']","['Tilgner K', 'Neganova I', 'Moreno-Gimeno I', 'Al-Aama JY', 'Burks D', 'Yung S', 'Singhapol C', 'Saretzki G', 'Evans J', 'Gorbunova V', 'Gennery A', 'Przyborski S', 'Stojkovic M', 'Armstrong L', 'Jeggo P', 'Lako M']","['Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle University, Newcastle, UK.']",['eng'],"['BB/E012841/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'PG/12/60/29799/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'R01 AG027237/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'G1000050/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0301182/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130531,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (LIG4 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/*physiology', 'DNA Ligase ATP', 'DNA Ligases/*deficiency/physiology', 'Genomic Instability/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",PMC3705601,,2013/06/01 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201344 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.44 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2013 Aug;20(8):1089-100. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.44.

NLE-mediated apoptosis was examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 41 patients with CLL. NLE induced a dose-dependent reduction in CLL cell viability with significant apoptosis observed at 0.06% (w/v) by 24 h. Annexin-V staining and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and caspase 3 cleavage were observed after NLE treatment. However, a pan-caspase inhibitor only partially blocked NLE-mediated cell death. NLE also caused loss of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor. Furthermore, NLE treatment resulted in LC3-I cleavage.

The diagnosis of this unconventional neoplastic evolution relies on a combination of immunophenotypic analysis and genotypic studies. A genotype identical to that of the primary B-cell neoplasm in a secondary neoplasm with H/DS immunophenotype supports the lineage conversion to H/DS. Putative mechanisms for this unusual phenomenon include dedifferentiation, common immature progenitor, and transdifferentiation models, the latter of which is suggested by clinical laboratory data at the present time. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing this lineage conversion may facilitate the understanding of carcinogenesis of not only hematopoietic but also nonhematolymphoid neoplasms.

Our objective was to determine the criterion validity of a risk-stratification algorithm based on treatment characteristics available from a pediatric cancer registry as a proxy for disease risk, by comparing it to traditional biology-based risk classifications. METHODS: We identified all children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed at a single institution between January 2000 and June 2011, and linked them to a population-based cancer registry. Several risk algorithms were then constructed using disease risk variables collected through chart review by a pediatric oncologist, and compared to a risk algorithm based on treatment protocol name and age, available from the registry. RESULTS: Of 596 patients identified, 579 (97.1%) met inclusion criteria and were successfully linked. The registry-based algorithm showed almost perfect agreement with a biology-based algorithm based on age, initial white blood cell count, immunophenotype and cytogenetics (kappa=0.85, 95th confidence interval 0.81-0.90). Discrepant cases were often due to the presence of unusual high risk features not captured by standard disease-risk variables but reflected in clinicians' choices of higher intensity treatment protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Protocol name represents a valid proxy of disease risk, allowing for risk stratification while conducting comparative effectiveness research using cancer registries and health services data. Future studies should examine the validity of treatment-based risk algorithms in other malignancies and using other treatment characteristics commonly found in health services data, such as the receipt of specific chemotherapeutic agents.","['Gupta, Sumit', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Guttmann, Astrid', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Gupta S', 'Pole JD', 'Guttmann A', 'Sung L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology and Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada. sumit.gupta@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20130530,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Registries', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",PMC3679990,,2013/06/01 06:00,2013/09/12 06:00,['2013/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2288-13-68 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-13-68 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2013 May 30;13:68. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-13-68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study of mice with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) specifically inactivated in osteoblast lineage cells revealed that EGFR stimulates bone formation by expanding the population of mesenchymal progenitors. EGFR ligands are potent regulators for the osteoprogenitor pool, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that activation of EGFR increases the number of osteoprogenitors by promoting cell proliferation and suppressing either serum depletion-induced or TNFalpha-induced apoptosis mainly through the MAPK/ERK pathway. Mouse calvarial organ culture revealed that EGF elevated the number of proliferative cells and decreased the number of apoptotic cells, which led to increased osteoblasts. Microarray analysis of MC3T3 cells, an osteoprogenitor cell line, revealed that EGFR signaling stimulates the expression of MCL1, an antiapoptotic protein, and a family of EGR transcription factors (EGR1, -2, and -3). The up-regulation of MCL1 and EGR2 by EGF was further confirmed in osteoprogenitors close to the calvarial bone surface. Overexpression of NAB2, a co-repressor for EGRs, attenuated the EGF-induced increase in osteoprogenitor number. Interestingly, knocking down the expression of EGR2, but not EGR1 or -3, resulted in a similar effect. Using inhibitor, adenovirus overexpression, and siRNA approaches, we demonstrate that EGFR signaling activates the MAPK/ERK pathway to stimulate the expression of EGR2, which in turn leads to cell growth and MCL1-mediated cell survival. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that EGFR-induced EGR2 expression is critical for osteoprogenitor maintenance and new bone formation.","['Chandra, Abhishek', 'Lan, Shenghui', 'Zhu, Ji', 'Siclari, Valerie A', 'Qin, Ling']","['Chandra A', 'Lan S', 'Zhu J', 'Siclari VA', 'Qin L']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['R25 CA101871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR050950/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA101871-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AR050950/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK095803/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 DK071988/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130529,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Egr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Immunoblotting', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Skull/cytology/metabolism']",PMC3711314,,2013/05/31 06:00,2013/09/28 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45618-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.447250 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Jul 12;288(28):20488-98. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.447250.

Somatic mutations in JAK2 are commonly associated with this myeloid proliferative disorder. To gain insight into the molecular events that are required for abnormally developing erythroid cells to escape dependence on normal growth signals, we performed in vitro expansion of mature erythroblasts (ERY) from seven normal healthy donors and from seven polycythemic patients in the presence of IL3, EPO, SCF for 10, 11, or 13 days. Normal ERYs required exposure to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) for expansion, while PV-derived ERYs expanded in the absence of dexamethasone. RNA expression profiling revealed enrichment of two known oncogenes, GPR56 and RAB4a, in PV-derived ERYs along with reduced expression levels of transcription factor TAL1 (ANOVA FDR < 0.05). While both normal and polycythemic-derived ERYs integrated signaling cascades for growth, they did so via different signaling pathways which are represented by their differential phospho-profiles. Our results show that normal ERYs displayed greater levels of phosphorylation of EGFR, PDGFRbeta, TGFbeta, and cKit, while PV-derived ERYs were characterized by increased phosphorylation of cytoplasmic kinases in the JAK/STAT, PI3K, and GATA1 pathways. Together these data suggest that PV erythroblast expansion and maturation may be maintained and enriched in the absence of dexamethasone through reduced TAL1 expression and by accessing additional signaling cascades. Members of this acquired repertoire may provide important insight into the pathogenesis of aberrant erythropoiesis in myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera.","['Hricik, Todd', 'Federici, Giulia', 'Zeuner, Ann', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Tirelli, Valentina', 'Varricchio, Lilian', 'Masiello, Francesca', 'Ciaffoni, Fiorella', 'Vaglio, Stefania', 'Petricoin, Emanuel F', 'Girelli, Gabriella', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Migliaccio, Anna Rita F']","['Hricik T', 'Federici G', 'Zeuner A', 'Alimena G', 'Tafuri A', 'Tirelli V', 'Varricchio L', 'Masiello F', 'Ciaffoni F', 'Vaglio S', 'Petricoin EF', 'Girelli G', 'Levine RL', 'Migliaccio AR']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 HL054459/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL116329/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'HL116329-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA138424/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130703,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (ADGRG1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (EPO protein, human)', '0 (IL3 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab4 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Erythroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'rab4 GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3771389,['NIHMS503075'],2013/05/31 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23487 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Sep;88(9):723-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23487.

DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of morphologically abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC expression of CD25 and/or CD2, and presence of KITD816V. RISK STRATIFICATION: The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of SM has been shown to be prognostically relevant. Classification of SM patients into indolent (SM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM associated with a clonal non-MC lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) and mast cell leukemia (MCL) subgroups is a useful first step in establishing prognosis. MANAGEMENT: SM treatment is generally palliative. ISM patients have a normal life expectancy and receive symptom-directed therapy; infrequently, cytoreductive therapy may be indicated for refractory symptoms. ASM patients have disease-related organ dysfunction; interferon-alpha (+/-corticosteroids) can control dermatological, hematological, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and mediator-release symptoms, but is hampered by poor tolerability. Similarly, cladribine has broad therapeutic activity, with particular utility when rapid MC debulking is indicated; the main toxicity is myelosuppression. Imatinib has a therapeutic role in the presence of an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation or in KITD816-unmutated patients. Treatment of SM-AHNMD is governed primarily by the non-MC neoplasm; hydroxyurea has modest utility in this setting. INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS: Dasatinib's in vitro anti- KITD816V activity has not translated into significant therapeutic activity in most SM patients. In contrast, recently updated data confirms Midostaurin's significant anti-MC activity in patients with advanced SM.","['Pardanani, Animesh']",['Pardanani A'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130530,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'CD2 Antigens/blood/genetics', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/blood/genetics', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', '*Palliative Care', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/blood/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Tryptases/blood/genetics']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23459 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Jul;88(7):612-24. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23459.

This study will investigate the exact mechanism of CJY on P-gp. METHODS: By assessment of ATPase activity, we gained further insight into the nature of the CJY interactions with P-gp. Kinetic studies on ATPase activity were applied to show the effects of Verapamil (Ver) on CJY-stimulated, CJX1 on Ver-stimulated, and CJX1 on CJY-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity. Furthermore, the combined effects of CJY with Ver, and CJY with CJX1 were also evaluated isobolographically in numerous fixed-ratio combinations of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:10. RESULTS: The results showed that basal P-gp ATPase activity was increased by CJY with half-maximal activity concentration (Km) of 2.9+/-0.3 muM and the maximal ATPase activity velocity (Vmax) of 265+/-21 nM . min-1 . mg-1. Kinetic studies on ATPase activity showed the effects of Verapamil (Ver) on CJY-stimulated, CJX1 on Ver-stimulated, and CJX1 on CJY-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity were all non-competitive inhibition, indicating that these substrates can simultaneously but independently bind to diverse sites on P-gp. The combined effects of CJY with Ver, and CJY with CJX1 show that mixtures of both drugs at these fixed-ratios displayed synergistic interactions. CONCLUSIONS: CJY, CJX1 and Ver bind P-gp on different sites. CJY could be applied combining with other P-gp inhibitors to get better reversal of multidrug resistance than it used alone.","['Cen, J', 'Liu, L', 'He, L', 'Ji, B-S']","['Cen J', 'Liu L', 'He L', 'Ji BS']","['Key Laboratory of Natural Medicine and Immune Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130529,Germany,Drug Res (Stuttg),Drug research,101602406,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CJX1, amlodipine derivative)', '0 (CJY compound)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '1J444QC288 (Amlodipine)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/*metabolism', 'Amlodipine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2015/03/03 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1345175 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Res (Stuttg). 2013 Aug;63(8):429-34. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1345175.

The disease typically occurs in elderly patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that impair apoptosis of clonal B-cells. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen as well as B-cell markers. PROGNOSIS: Two prognostic staging systems exist, the Rai and Binet staging systems, which are established by physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers also have prognostic value. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) predict resistance to most available therapies. THERAPY: Patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. For physical fit patients, chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab represents the current standard therapy. For unfit patients, treatment with an anti-CD20 antibody plus a milder chemotherapy (chlorambucil) is currently established as standard treatment. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated, if the treatment-free interval exceeds two years. If the disease relapses earlier, alternative therapies such as bendamustine alone or with rituximab, alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, or ofatumumab should be used. Patients with a del(17p) or TP53 should be considered for an allogeneic SCT. FUTURE CHALLENGES: Several new agents (e.g., ibrutinib, obinutuzumab) hold the potential to change standard of CLL treatment in the next 6-12 months. Therefore, CLL patients should be included into current clinical trials whenever possible.","['Hallek, Michael']",['Hallek M'],"['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Center for Integrated Oncology Koln-Bonn, Center of Excellence on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases, Kerpener Strasse 62, Koln, Germany. michael.hallek@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'CD5 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23491 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Sep;88(9):803-16. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23491.,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: A 28-year-old immunocompromised man with pneumonia, respiratory failure, and neutropenic fever was initiated on ABLC and other antibiotics for suspected invasive aspergillosis. Due to the patient's deteriorating renal function, the use of amphotericin B was deemed preferable to the standard therapy for invasive aspergillosis (voriconazole) even though he had experienced likely infusion-related reactions to ABLC on two prior occasions. During the infusion of ABLC, significant increases in the man's temperature, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were observed. Although those symptoms were suspected to be infusion related, it was decided that continuing amphotericin B therapy with an alternative lipid-based form of the drug was the best course of action. After the patient was switched to liposomal amphotericin B one day later, no further infusion-related adverse reactions were noted for the duration of therapy. While this case suggests that adverse reactions to one type of amphotericin B might not occur with the use of an alternative formulation, further research is needed to better define the potential for cross-reactivity among various forms of amphotericin B and related safe-infusion practices. CONCLUSION: A patient with invasive aspergillosis who experienced likely infusion- related reactions to ABLC was able to tolerate continued amphotericin B therapy after a switch to the liposomal formulation.","['Buckley, Mitchell S', 'Anderson, Clint S', 'Patel, Shardool A', 'Yerondopoulos, Melanie J', 'Wicks, Laura M', 'Martin, Mary T']","['Buckley MS', 'Anderson CS', 'Patel SA', 'Yerondopoulos MJ', 'Wicks LM', 'Martin MT']","['Department of Pharmacy, Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, 1111 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, AZ 85006, USA. mitchell.buckley@bannerhealth.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Dosage Forms)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross Reactions/*drug effects', 'Dosage Forms', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*drug effects', 'Infusions, Intravenous/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Neutropenia', 'Pneumonia', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic', 'Respiratory Insufficiency']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2013/10/29 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['70/12/1047 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp120530 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2013 Jun 15;70(12):1047-51. doi: 10.2146/ajhp120530.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted retrospectively, using data from the Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant, National Transplant Registry, Malaysia. All cases of AML treated with allogeneic HSCT registered at the registry between 1st January 1987 and 31st December 2010 were included in the study. A total of 300 patients were included for final analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression were used for statistical analysis. The overall 10-year OS and DFS for Malaysian AML patients after allogeneic HSCT were 63 and 67 %, respectively. Donor gender, marrow status, and conditioning intensity were identified as important prognostic factors for overall survival, whereas the significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival were ethnic group, donor gender, marrow status, and conditioning intensity. In conclusion, the survival outcomes for Malaysian AML patients treated with allogeneic HSCT were good, and this treatment should be considered the standard therapeutic approach for suitable candidates.","['Mangantig, Ernest', 'Naing, Nyi Nyi', ""Norsa'adah, Bachok"", 'Azlan, Husin']","['Mangantig E', 'Naing NN', ""Norsa'adah B"", 'Azlan H']","['Regenerative Medicine Cluster, Advanced Medical & Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Bertam, 13200 Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. ernestmangantig@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20130530,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2014/06/19 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1373-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Aug;98(2):197-205. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1373-1.

It is caused by an expansion of fetal megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) triggered by trisomy of chromosome 21 and is further enhanced by the somatic acquisition of a mutation in GATA1. These mutations result in the expression of a short-isoform GATA1s lacking the N-terminal domain. To examine the hypothesis that the Hsa21 ETS transcription factor ERG cooperates with GATA1s in this process, we generated double-transgenic mice expressing hERG and Gata1s. We show that increased expression of ERG by itself is sufficient to induce expansion of MEPs in fetal livers. Gata1s expression synergizes with ERG in enhancing the expansion of fetal MEPs and megakaryocytic precursors, resulting in hepatic fibrosis, transient postnatal thrombocytosis, anemia, a gene expression profile that is similar to that of human TMD and progression to progenitor myeloid leukemia by 3 months of age. This ERG/Gata1s transgenic mouse model also uncovers an essential role for the N terminus of Gata1 in erythropoiesis and the antagonistic role of ERG in fetal erythroid differentiation and survival. The human relevance of this finding is underscored by the recent discovery of similar mutations in GATA1 in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.","['Birger, Yehudit', 'Goldberg, Liat', 'Chlon, Timothy M', 'Goldenson, Benjamin', 'Muler, Inna', 'Schiby, Ginette', 'Jacob-Hirsch, Jasmin', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Crispino, John D', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Birger Y', 'Goldberg L', 'Chlon TM', 'Goldenson B', 'Muler I', 'Schiby G', 'Jacob-Hirsch J', 'Rechavi G', 'Crispino JD', 'Izraeli S']","['Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA120772/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA120772-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130529,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Down Syndrome/*blood/*complications', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Liver/embryology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/*complications', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",PMC3739041,,2013/05/31 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56005-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-10-460998 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 8;122(6):988-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-10-460998.

Ligation of activating NK receptors with their ligands expressed on target cells induces receptor clustering and actin reorganization at the interface and triggers polarized movement of lytic granules to the contact site. Although activation of the small GTPase Rac has been implicated in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, its precise role and the upstream regulator remain elusive. Here, we show that DOCK2, an atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac, plays a key role in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We found that although DOCK2 deficiency in NK cells did not affect conjugate formation with target cells, DOCK2-deficienct NK cells failed to effectively kill leukemia cells in vitro and major histocompatibility complex class I-deficient bone marrow cells in vivo, regardless of the sorts of activating receptors. In DOCK2-deficient NK cells, NKG2D-mediated Rac activation was almost completely lost, resulting in a severe defect in the lytic synapse formation. Similar results were obtained when the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of DOCK2 was selectively abrogated. These results indicate that DOCK2-Rac axis controls NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through the lytic synapse formation.","['Sakai, Yusuke', 'Tanaka, Yoshihiko', 'Yanagihara, Toyoshi', 'Watanabe, Mayuki', 'Duan, Xuefeng', 'Terasawa, Masao', 'Nishikimi, Akihiko', 'Sanematsu, Fumiyuki', 'Fukui, Yoshinori']","['Sakai Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Yanagihara T', 'Watanabe M', 'Duan X', 'Terasawa M', 'Nishikimi A', 'Sanematsu F', 'Fukui Y']","['Division of Immunogenetics, Department of Immunobiology and Neuroscience, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130529,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DOCK2 protein, mouse)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Immunological Synapses/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/enzymology/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56068-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-12-475897 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jul 18;122(3):386-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-12-475897.

We aimed to study the impact of TKIs on the in vivo B-cell response to vaccination. Cellular and humoral responses to influenza and pneumococcal vaccines were evaluated in 51 chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients on imatinib, or second-line dasatinib and nilotinib, and 24 controls. Following vaccination, CML patients on TKI had significant impairment of IgM humoral response to pneumococcus compared with controls (IgM titer 79.0 vs 200 U/mL, P = .0006), associated with significantly lower frequencies of peripheral blood IgM memory B cells. To elucidate whether CML itself or treatment with TKI was responsible for the impaired humoral response, we assessed memory B-cell subsets in paired samples collected before and after imatinib therapy. Treatment with imatinib was associated with significant reductions in IgM memory B cells. In vitro coincubation of B cells with plasma from CML patients on TKI or with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib induced significant and dose-dependent inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and indirectly its downstream substrate, phospholipase-C-gamma2, both important in B-cell signaling and survival. These data indicate that TKIs, through off-target inhibition of kinases important in B-cell signaling, reduce memory B-cell frequencies and induce significant impairment of B-cell responses in CML.","['de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Khoder, Ahmad', 'Hart, Melanie', 'Sarvaria, Anushruti', 'Sekine, Takuya', 'Alsuliman, Abdullah', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Bazeos, Alexandra', 'Stringaris, Kate', 'Ali, Sara', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Chaidos, Aristeidis', 'Cooper, Nichola', 'Gabriel, Ian', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Belsey, Sarah', 'Flanagan, Robert J', 'Goldman, John', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Kelleher, Peter', 'Marin, David', 'Rezvani, Katayoun']","['de Lavallade H', 'Khoder A', 'Hart M', 'Sarvaria A', 'Sekine T', 'Alsuliman A', 'Mielke S', 'Bazeos A', 'Stringaris K', 'Ali S', 'Milojkovic D', 'Foroni L', 'Chaidos A', 'Cooper N', 'Gabriel I', 'Apperley J', 'Belsey S', 'Flanagan RJ', 'Goldman J', 'Shpall EJ', 'Kelleher P', 'Marin D', 'Rezvani K']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130529,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Influenza Vaccines)', '0 (Pneumococcal Vaccines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/drug effects/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood/immunology', 'Immunologic Memory/drug effects', 'Influenza Vaccines/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phospholipase C gamma/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pneumococcal Vaccines/immunology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC5726329,,2013/05/31 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56094-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-465039 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jul 11;122(2):227-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-465039.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cytotoxic effects of Nutlin-3 encapsulated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (NP-Nut) and into rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody)-engineered NP (NP-Rt-Nut) as well as of NPs engineered with rituximab alone (NP-Rt) were initially analyzed in vitro in JVM-2 B-leukemic cells, by assessing both the functional activation of the p53 pathway (by Nutlin-3) and/or the activation of the complement cascade (by rituximab). Moreover, the potential therapeutic efficacy of NP-Nut, NP-Rt, and NP-Rt-Nut were comparatively assessed in vivo in CD20(+) JVM-2 leukemic xenograft SCID mice. RESULTS: Functional in vitro assays showed that NP-Nut and NP-Rt-Nut exhibited a comparable ability to activate the p53 pathway in the p53(wild-type) JVM-2 leukemic cells. On the other hand, NP-Rt and NP-Rt-Nut, but not NP nor NP-Nut, were able to promote activation of the complement cascade. Of note, the in vivo intratumoral injection in JVM-2 B-leukemic/xenograft mice showed that NP-Rt-Nut displayed the maximal therapeutic activity promoting a survival rate significantly higher not only with respect to control animals, treated either with vehicle or with empty NP, but also with respect to animals treated with NP-Nut or NP-Rt.

This follow-up study first compared the activity of reporter constructs with three haplotypes estimated with the rs2239633 and its proximity nucleotide variants in strong linkage. The most frequent haplotype was CTTTTGT (H1), and the second most frequent haplotype consisted of entirely opposite alleles to H1 (TCGCACC, H2). Their luciferase activity revealed the strongest expression with H2 and the weakest with H1. Subsequent analysis revealed that different luciferase activity was found by the single-nucleotide substitution at rs2239632 and rs2239633 (P<0.05). Especially, the difference in luciferase activity between two alleles of rs2239632 corresponded to the difference between H1 and H2. We concluded that rs2239632 could regulate the expression of the CEBPE gene. We suggest a hypothesis that its risk allele (G) might increase the gene product and lead to leukemogenesis. As a result, a person with the allele or the corresponding haplotype might have increased susceptibility to ALL. Further research is warranted to investigate this hypothesis and the underlying mechanisms.","['Ryoo, Hyunju', 'Kong, Minyoung', 'Kim, Younyoung', 'Lee, Chaeyoung']","['Ryoo H', 'Kong M', 'Kim Y', 'Lee C']","['School of Systems Biomedical Science, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130530,England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Variation', '*Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleotides/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2014/04/03 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['jhg201362 [pii]', '10.1038/jhg.2013.62 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2013 Sep;58(9):600-3. doi: 10.1038/jhg.2013.62.

This review summarizes the recent findings in this field and their impact on our current understanding of this neoplasm. RECENT FINDINGS: Genomic studies have revealed a remarkable molecular heterogeneity of the disease, with only few genes mutated in up to 10-15% of the patients and a relatively large number of genes recurrently mutated at low frequency. The mutated genes tend to cluster in different pathways that include NOTCH1 signaling, RNA splicing, processing and transport machinery, innate inflammatory response, and DNA damage and cell cycle control, among others. NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations are emerging as new drivers of aggressive forms of the disease. Genome-wide methylation studies have shown that CLL transformation is associated with a massive hypomethylation phenomenon frequently affecting the enhancer regions. This epigenetic reprogramming maintains an imprint of the putative cell of origin from naive and memory B-cells. SUMMARY: Genomic and epigenomic studies of CLL are reshaping our understanding of the disease and provide new perspective for a more individualized diagnosis and new potential therapeutic targets.","['Martin-Subero, Jose I', 'Lopez-Otin, Carlos', 'Campo, Elias']","['Martin-Subero JI', 'Lopez-Otin C', 'Campo E']","[""Unidad de Hematopatologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital Clinic, Universidad de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenomics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32836235dc [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2013 Jul;20(4):362-8. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32836235dc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically the cat was obese, pyrexic (39.8 degrees C), had acute abdominal pain and severe bilirubinuria. Haematology and serum biochemistry revealed severe panleukopenia, thrombocytopenia, markedly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and five-fold increased pre-prandial bile acids. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the abdomen did not identify any abnormalities. Serum tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) were negative. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment for infectious hepatitis was to no avail; the cat deteriorated and died 72 h after admission. Necropsy revealed mild icterus and anaemia, severe multifocal hepatic necrosis, serofibrinous hydrothorax, pulmonary oedema and interstitial pneumonia. Histopathology confirmed the macroscopic findings and revealed multifocal microgranulomata in the brain and myocardium, as well as areas of necrosis in lymph nodes and multifocally in splenic red pulp. Long bone shaft marrow was hyperplastic with a predominance of leukocyte precursors and megakaryocytes and splenic red pulp showed mild extramedullary haemopoiesis.

Intensive chemotherapy treatment in elderly patients (over 60) has disappointing results. In these patients, conservative treatment, including compensation of deficiency of red blood cells and platelets by transfusions and treatment of infectious complications is recommended. Also, relatively new treatment with hypometyl agents (azacytidine, decitabine) could be used. DESIGN: The idea of this article is to present a spontaneous remission phenomenon, which has not been published in Czech literature yet. In this article, we present 2 case studies of our patients who were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, were not treated with chemotherapy and spontaneously reached remission of acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of the spontaneous remission remain unclear, but we assume positive effect of a severe systemic infection or previous applications of blood transfusions. Antibodies in blood transfusions and a strong immune response to sepsis may have contributed to spontaneous remission.","['Pachner, M', 'Vokurka, S', 'Koza, V', 'Svoboda, T', 'Hrabetova, M', 'Jindra, P', 'Lysak, D', 'Vozobulova, V', 'Schutzova, M', 'Karas, M']","['Pachner M', 'Vokurka S', 'Koza V', 'Svoboda T', 'Hrabetova M', 'Jindra P', 'Lysak D', 'Vozobulova V', 'Schutzova M', 'Karas M']","['Hematologicko-onkologicke oddeleni, FN Plzen. pachnerm@fnplzen.cz']",['cze'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Middle Aged', '*Remission, Spontaneous']",,,2013/05/31 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['40624 [pii]', '10.14735/amko2013140 [doi]']",ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2013;26(2):140-2. doi: 10.14735/amko2013140.,,,,,Spontanni remise akutni myeloidni leukemie - klinicke pripady jednoho centra.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frequent relapses and eventual resistance to fludarabine characterize symptomatic CLL and portends a dismal prognosis for patients. Growing evidence has shown that signaling pathways such as the B cell receptor and NFkB are implicated in the survival and proliferation of the CLL cells which are ultimately associated with persistence of the disease. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase pathway regulates downstream activation of the B cell receptor and has emerged as an attractive target. Ibrutinib inhibits the Bruton's tyrosine kinase pathway, and consequently induces apoptosis of B cells.

Recently, beneficial effects for immune functions of Korean red ginseng (KRG) have been reported in adults. This study was performed to investigate the effects of ginseng on immune functions in children after cessation of chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation for advanced cancer. Thirty patients, who were diagnosed and treated for leukemia and solid cancer at the department of pediatrics and adolescence of the Yeungnam University Hospital from June 2004 to June 2009, were enrolled for the study. The study group consisted of 19 patients who received KRG extract (60 mg/kg/d) for 1 yr and 11 patients who did not receive KRG extract were the control group. Blood samples were collected every 6 mo. Immune assays included circulating lymphocyte subpopulation, serum cytokines (IL- 2, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma), and total concentrations of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM subclasses. Age at diagnosis ranged from 2 mo to 15 yr (median 5 yr). Nine patients received stem cell transplantation. The cytokines of the KRG treated group were decreasing more rapidly than that of the control group. Lymphocyte subpopulations (T cell, B cell, NK cell, T4, T8, and T4/ T8 ratio) and serum immunoglobulin subclasses (IgG, IgA, and IgM) did not show significant differences between the study and the control groups. This study suggests that KRG extract might have a stabilizing effect on the inflammatory cytokines in children with cancer after chemotherapy.","['Lee, Jae Min', 'Hah, Jeong Ok', 'Kim, Hee Sun']","['Lee JM', 'Hah JO', 'Kim HS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu 705-717, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),J Ginseng Res,Journal of ginseng research,100890690,,,,PMC3659604,,2013/05/30 06:00,2013/05/30 06:01,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5142/jgr.2012.36.4.383 [doi]', 'grosbr-36-383 [pii]']",ppublish,J Ginseng Res. 2012 Oct;36(4):383-90. doi: 10.5142/jgr.2012.36.4.383.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancer', 'Cytokine', 'Korean red ginseng', 'Panax ginseng']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Associations between cumulative external radiation dose and mortality due to solid cancers, leukaemia and circulatory disease were examined. METHODS: All workers hired by CEA, AREVA NC and EDF between 1950 and 1994 who were employed for at least 1 year, badge-monitored for radiation exposure and alive on 1 January 1968 were included. Individual data of annual exposure to penetrating photons (X-rays and gamma rays) were reconstructed for each worker. Estimates of radiation dose-mortality associations were obtained using a linear excess relative risk (ERR) Poisson regression model. RESULTS: Among the 59 021 nuclear workers, 2312 died of solid cancer, 78 of leukaemia and 1468 of circulatory diseases during the 1968-2004 period. Approximately 72% of the cohort had a non-zero cumulative radiation dose estimate, with a mean cumulative dose of 22.5 mSv. Positive but non-significant ERR/Sv were observed for all solid cancers, leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), ischaemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular diseases. A significant ERR/Sv was found for myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first combined analysis of major French cohorts of nuclear workers. Results were consistent with risks estimated in other nuclear worker cohorts and illustrate the potential of a further joint international study to yield direct risk estimates in support to radiation protection standards.","['Metz-Flamant, C', 'Laurent, O', 'Samson, E', 'Caer-Lorho, S', 'Acker, A', 'Hubert, D', 'Richardson, D B', 'Laurier, D']","['Metz-Flamant C', 'Laurent O', 'Samson E', 'Caer-Lorho S', 'Acker A', 'Hubert D', 'Richardson DB', 'Laurier D']","['PRP-HOM/SRBE/LEPID, Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130528,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality/pathology/physiopathology', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring', 'Radiation Protection/methods', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2013/05/30 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2012-101149 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2012-101149 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2013 Sep;70(9):630-8. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2012-101149.

Therefore, a more comprehensive methylation profiling is needed to study the implications of this epigenetic marker in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Here, we have analyzed 71 chronic (24 polycythemia vera, 23 essential thrombocythemia and 24 primary myelofibrosis) and 13 transformed myeloproliferative neoplasms using genome-wide DNA methylation arrays. The three types of chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms showed a similar aberrant DNA methylation pattern when compared to control samples. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in a gene network centered on the NF-kappaB pathway, indicating that they may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In the case of transformed myeloproliferative neoplasms, we detected an increased number of differentially methylated regions with respect to chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. Interestingly, these genes were enriched in a list of differentially methylated regions in primary acute myeloid leukemia and in a gene network centered around the IFN pathway. Our results suggest that alterations in the DNA methylation landscape play an important role in the pathogenesis and leukemic transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Immunohistochemical staining is therefore recommended as the technique of choice in front-line screening. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed bone marrow biopsies compared with gold standard molecular analysis to predict nucleophosmin 1 mutation status in 119 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Discrepant cases were further characterized by gene expression analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A large overlap between both methods was observed. Nevertheless, nine patients demonstrated discordant results at initial screening. Five cases demonstrated nuclear staining of nucleophosmin 1 by immunohistochemistry, but a nucleophosmin 1 mutation by molecular analysis. In two cases this could be attributed to technical issues and in three cases minor subpopulations of myeloblasts had not been discovered initially. All tested cases exhibited the characteristic nucleophosmin-mutated gene expression pattern. Four cases had cytoplasmic nucleophosmin 1 staining and a nucleophosmin-mutated gene expression pattern without a detectable nucleophosmin 1 mutation. In two of these cases we found the chromosomal translocation t(3;5)(q25;q35) encoding the NPM-MLF1 fusion protein. In the other discrepant cases the aberrant cytoplasmic nucleophosmin staining and gene expression could not be explained. In total six patients (5%) had true discordant results between immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis. We conclude that cytoplasmic nucleophosmin localization is not always caused by a conventional nucleophosmin 1 mutation and that in the screening for nucleophosmin 1 abnormalities, most information will be obtained by combining immunohistochemistry with molecular analysis.","['Woolthuis, Carolien M', 'Mulder, Andre B', 'Verkaik-Schakel, Rikst Nynke', 'Rosati, Stefano', 'Diepstra, Arjan', 'van den Berg, Eva', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Kluin, Philip M', 'Huls, Gerwin']","['Woolthuis CM', 'Mulder AB', 'Verkaik-Schakel RN', 'Rosati S', 'Diepstra A', 'van den Berg E', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Vellenga E', 'Kluin PM', 'Huls G']",['c.m.woolthuis@umcg.nl.'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130528,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Young Adult']",PMC3789457,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.079806 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.079806 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Oct;98(10):1532-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.079806.

Of a total of 397 patients who were diagnosed with core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia, 208 experienced a first relapse, and analyses were performed in 139 patients for whom additional data were available. In the entire cohort, the overall survival rate after relapse was 48% at 3 years. By multivariate analysis, younger age at diagnosis, a longer interval before relapse, and inv(16) were shown to be independently associated with better survival after relapse. Although there was no significant difference in survival after relapse between patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and those who did not in the overall series of relapsed patients, we found that transplantation significantly improved survival among patients who had t(8;21) (54% versus 26% at 3 years, P=0.002). In addition, among patients with t(8;21), those who had different cytogenetics at relapse had a significantly improved survival after transplantation, while those who had same cytogenetics did not.

Among the non-hyperdiploid myelomas, the hypodiploid subtype has the most aggressive clinical phenotype, but the genetic differences between groups are not completely defined. In order to understand the genetic background of hypodiploid multiple myeloma better, we compared the genomic (array-based comparative genomic hybridization) and transcriptomic (gene expression profiling) background of 49 patients with hypodiploid myeloma with 50 other non-hyperdiploid and 125 hyperdiploid myeloma patients. There were significant chromosomal and gene expression differences between hyperdiploid patients and non-hyperdiploid and hypodiploid patients. Non-hyperdiploid and hypodiploid patients shared most of the chromosomal abnormalities; nevertheless a subset of these abnormalities, such as monosomies 13, 14 and 22, was markedly increased in hypodiploid patients. Furthermore, deletions of 1p, 12p, 16q and 17p, all associated with poor outcome or progression in multiple myeloma, were significantly enriched in hypodiploid patients. Molecular risk-stratification indices reinforce the worse prognosis associated with hypodiploid multiple myeloma compared with non-hyperdiploid multiple myeloma. Gene expression profiling clustered hypodiploid and non-hyperdiploid subgroups closer than hyperdiploid myeloma but also highlighted the up-regulation of CCND2, WHSC1/MMSET and FGFR3 in the hypodiploid subtype. In summary, hypodiploid multiple myeloma is genetically similar to non-hyperdiploid multiple myeloma but characterized by a higher prevalence of genetic alterations associated with poor outcome and disease progression. It is provocative to hypothesize that hypodiploid multiple myeloma is an advanced stage of non-hyperdiploid multiple myeloma.","['Van Wier, Scott', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Baker, Angela', 'Ahmann, Gregory', 'Levy, Joan', 'Carpten, John D', 'Fonseca, Rafael']","['Van Wier S', 'Braggio E', 'Baker A', 'Ahmann G', 'Levy J', 'Carpten JD', 'Fonseca R']",['fonseca.rafael@mayo.edu.'],['eng'],"['R01 CA083724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21115T/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90297052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA062242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130528,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', '*Diploidy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/genetics']",PMC3789464,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.081083 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.081083 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Oct;98(10):1586-92. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.081083.

However, the impact of this mutation on survival in early stages of disease, in chronic phase, has never been detailed. Using matched pair analysis, a cohort of 64 patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia harboring a T315I mutation and resistant to imatinib mesylate was compared to a similar cohort of 53 chronic phase patients resistant to imatinib, but with no detectable T315I mutation, in the pre-ponatinib era. These patients were matched according to age at diagnosis, interval between disease diagnosis and start of imatinib treatment, and duration of imatinib therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated the significant negative impact of the presence of the T315I mutation on overall survival (since imatinib-resistance: 48.4 months for T315I(+) patients versus not reached for T315I(-) ones; P=0.006) and failure-free survival (since imatinib-resistance: 34.7 months for T315I(+) patients versus not reached for T315I(-) patients; P=0.003). In addition, Cox proportional hazard models adjusted on overall survival demonstrated the negative influence of the T315I mutation (P=0.02, HR=2.54). These results confirm early assumptions concerning the poor prognosis of chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patients with the T315I mutation who are not eligible for allogeneic transplantation, and demonstrate the need for more therapeutic options.","['Nicolini, Franck E', 'Ibrahim, Amr R', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Dufva, Inge H', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Labussiere, Helene', 'Morisset, Stephane', 'Roche-Lestienne, Catherine', 'Lippert, Eric', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Peter, Senaka', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Maguer-Satta, Veronique', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Goldman, John', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Marin, David', 'Etienne, Gabriel']","['Nicolini FE', 'Ibrahim AR', 'Soverini S', 'Martinelli G', 'Muller MC', 'Hochhaus A', 'Dufva IH', 'Kim DW', 'Cortes J', 'Mauro MJ', 'Chuah C', 'Labussiere H', 'Morisset S', 'Roche-Lestienne C', 'Lippert E', 'Hayette S', 'Peter S', 'Zhou W', 'Maguer-Satta V', 'Michallet M', 'Goldman J', 'Apperley JF', 'Mahon FX', 'Marin D', 'Etienne G']",['franck-emmanuel.nicolini@chu-lyon.fr.'],['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20130528,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC3789454,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.080234 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.080234 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Oct;98(10):1510-6. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.080234.

This study evaluated complete molecular response rates in imatinib-treated chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients with major molecular response by using the international standardization for quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson1 gene. The correlation of complete molecular response with various clinical, pharmacokinetic, and immunological parameters was determined. Complete molecular response was observed in 75/152 patients (49.3%). In the univariate analysis, Sokal score, median time to major molecular response, ABCG2 421C>A, and regulatory T cells were significantly lower in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients with complete molecular response than in those without complete molecular response. In the multivariate analysis, duration of imatinib treatment (odds ratio: 1.0287, P=0.0003), time to major molecular response from imatinib therapy (odds ratio: 0.9652, P=0.0020), and ABCG2 421C/C genotype (odds ratio: 0.3953, P=0.0284) were independent predictors of complete molecular response. In contrast, number of natural killer cells, BIM deletion polymorphisms, and plasma trough imatinib concentration were not significantly associated with achieving a complete molecular response. Several predictive markers for achieving complete molecular response were identified in this study. According to our findings, some chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with imatinib may benefit from a switch to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ClinicalTrials.gov, UMIN000004935).","['Shinohara, Yoshinori', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Nishiwaki, Kaichi', 'Hino, Masayuki', 'Kashimura, Makoto', 'Wakita, Hisashi', 'Hatano, Yoshiaki', 'Hirasawa, Akira', 'Nakagawa, Yasuaki', 'Itoh, Kuniaki', 'Masuoka, Hidekazu', 'Aotsuka, Nobuyuki', 'Matsuura, Yasuhiro', 'Takahara, Sinobu', 'Sano, Koji', 'Kuroki, Jun', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Mugitani, Atsuko', 'Nakane, Takahiko', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Niioka, Takenori', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Sawada, Kenichi']","['Shinohara Y', 'Takahashi N', 'Nishiwaki K', 'Hino M', 'Kashimura M', 'Wakita H', 'Hatano Y', 'Hirasawa A', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Itoh K', 'Masuoka H', 'Aotsuka N', 'Matsuura Y', 'Takahara S', 'Sano K', 'Kuroki J', 'Hata T', 'Nakamae H', 'Mugitani A', 'Nakane T', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Niioka T', 'Miura M', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20130528,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Internationality', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*standards', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3762097,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.085167 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.085167 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Sep;98(9):1407-13. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.085167.

Despite the incorporation of rituximab into fludarabine-based chemotherapy regimens, the incidence of autoimmune cytopenias has remained high. Inadequate rituximab exposure due to rapid antibody clearance may be a contributing factor. To test this hypothesis, we measured serum rituximab levels in patients treated with fludarabine and rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). All patients had undetectable rituximab trough levels by the end of cycle 1, and one-third had undetectable levels already on Day 6 of cycle 1. Although rituximab trough levels increased progressively with each cycle, only by cycle 4 did the median trough level exceed 10 ug/mL. The median half-life of rituximab during cycle 1 was 27 hours, compared to 199 hours during cycle 4 (P<0.0001). There was a significant inverse correlation between the rituximab half-life in cycle 1 and the degree of tumor burden (P=0.02). Two patients who were identified as having subclinical autoimmune hemolysis prior to therapy were given additional doses of rituximab during the initial cycles of therapy and did not develop clinically significant hemolysis. One patient who developed clinically significant hemolysis during therapy was given additional rituximab doses during cycles 3-5 and was able to successfully complete his treatment. In conclusion, rituximab is cleared so rapidly during the initial cycles of therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia that most patients have only transient serum levels. More frequent dosing of rituximab may be required to prevent autoimmune complications in at-risk patients (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:00001586).","['Mo, Clifton C', 'Njuguna, Ndegwa', 'Beum, Paul V', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Vire, Berengere', 'Lee, Elinor', 'Marti, Gerald', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Taylor, Ronald P', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Mo CC', 'Njuguna N', 'Beum PV', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Vire B', 'Lee E', 'Marti G', 'Wilson WH', 'Taylor RP', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130528,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*blood/*chemically induced', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/blood']",PMC3729907,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.080929 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.080929 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Aug;98(8):1259-63. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.080929.

Since there is limited information on the distribution of clinico-biological variables in different age cohorts, we analyzed 5202 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the Italian multicenter AIEOP and GIMEMA protocols and stratified them in nine age cohorts. The highest prevalence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was observed in children, although a second peak was recorded from the 4(th) decade onwards. Interestingly, the lowest incidence was found in females between 14-40 years. Immunophenotypic characterization showed a B-lineage in 85.8% of patients: a pro-B stage, associated with MLL/AF4 positivity, was more frequent in patients between 10-50 years. T-lineage leukemia (14.2%) was rare among small children and increased in patients aged 10-40 years. The prevalence of the BCR/ABL1 rearrangement increased progressively with age starting from the cohort of patients 10-14 years old and was present in 52.7% of cases in the 6th decade. Similarly, the MLL/AF4 rearrangement constantly increased up to the 5(th) decade, while the ETV6/RUNX1 rearrangement disappeared from the age of 30 onwards. This study shows that acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adolescents and young adults is characterized by a male prevalence, higher percentage of T-lineage cases, an increase of poor prognostic molecular markers with aging compared to cases in children, and conclusively quantified the progressive increase of BCR/ABL(+) cases with age, which are potentially manageable by targeted therapies.","['Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Cazzaniga, Gianni', 'Orlando, Sonia Maria', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Testi, Anna Maria', 'Mancini, Francesca', 'Conter, Valentino', 'te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Fioritoni, Giuseppe', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Foa, Robin']","['Chiaretti S', 'Vitale A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Orlando SM', 'Silvestri D', 'Fazi P', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Elia L', 'Testi AM', 'Mancini F', 'Conter V', 'te Kronnie G', 'Ferrara F', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Tedeschi A', 'Fioritoni G', 'Fabbiano F', 'Meloni G', 'Specchia G', 'Pizzolo G', 'Mandelli F', 'Guarini A', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'Foa R']",['rfoa@bce.uniroma1.it or chiaretti@bce.uniroma1.it.'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130528,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC3815170,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.080432 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.080432 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Nov;98(11):1702-10. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.080432.

CLL is searched whenever a persistent lymphocytosis is found. AIM: To evaluate the performance of flow cytometry in etiologic diagnosis of lymphocytosis. Could it allow us to distinguish CLL from other causes of lymphocytosis? METHODS: Blood samples from 104 adult patients having a rate of lymphocytes> 5000 ele/mm3 persisting more than three months were analyzed using a large panel of monoclonal antibodies in three colors and Cell Quest software. results: Lymphoproliferative B disorder was retained in 83 cases, including 50 cases of typical CLL with Matutes score>/= 4 and 12 cases of atypical CLL with Matutes score = 3 . Diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia and follicular lymphoma were guided by the respective specific antigen expression CD103 and CD10. Large granular T lymphoma (LGL-T) was the most common etiology of lymphoid T proliferation. Unusual cases of Natural Killer (NK) and NK/T proliferations were found.

METHODS: Body height and the GH-related parameters insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3(IGFBP-3) were determined repetitively 3-monthly over 2 years in 21 pediatric CML-patients on standardized imatinib treatment. In an animal model 4-week-old male Wistar rats were exposed over 10 weeks to imatinib, dasatinib, or bosutinib at varying concentrations via the drinking water. Blood was collected at prepubertal age, pubertal age, and at adult age, respectively, and animals' serum levels of IGFBP-3 were measured. RESULTS: Independent from treatment duration patients exhibited IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels almost exclusively in the very low range when compared to age-matched references. No clear pattern of rising or falling IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels was observed. In rats, compared to controls, serum IGFBP-3 was significantly lowered for all TKIs tested, at all concentrations applied, and at all ages under investigation. CONCLUSION: Besides direct off-target effects on the growing skeleton, TKI treatment also results in lowered blood levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3.A juvenile rat model predicts this side effect for dasatinib and bosutinib. Thus, growth and GH- related parameters should be monitored regularly in pediatric patients with CML on TKIs.","['Ulmer, A', 'Tabea Tauer, J', 'Glauche, I', 'Jung, R', 'Suttorp, M']","['Ulmer A', 'Tabea Tauer J', 'Glauche I', 'Jung R', 'Suttorp M']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130528,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (IGFBP3 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Body Height/drug effects', 'Bone Development/drug effects', 'Child', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/03/25 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1343483 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2013 May;225(3):120-6. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1343483.

We report here that T cells deficient for c-Rel have a dramatically reduced ability to cause acute GVHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation using major and minor histocompatibility mismatched murine models. In the study to understand the underlying mechanisms, we found that c-Rel(-/-) T cells had a reduced ability to expand in lymphoid organs and to infiltrate in GVHD target organs in allogeneic recipients. c-Rel(-/-) T cells were defective in the differentiation into Th1 cells after encountering alloantigens, but were enhanced in the differentiation toward Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. Furthermore, c-Rel(-/-) T cells had largely preserved activity to mediate graft-versus-leukemia response. Taken together, our findings indicate that c-Rel plays an essential role in T cells in the induction of acute GVHD, and suggest that c-Rel can be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in the clinic.","['Yu, Yu', 'Wang, Dapeng', 'Kaosaard, Kane', 'Liu, Chen', 'Fu, Jianing', 'Haarberg, Kelley', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Beg, Amer A', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong']","['Yu Y', 'Wang D', 'Kaosaard K', 'Liu C', 'Fu J', 'Haarberg K', 'Anasetti C', 'Beg AA', 'Yu XZ']","['Department of Immunology, H.

Accumulation of ROS triggers oxidative stress in various cell types and contributes to the development, progression, and persistence of cancer. Recent research has demonstrated that redox dysregulation caused by ROS promotes proliferation, differentiation, genomic, and epigenetic alterations; immune evasion; and survival in leukemic cells. ROS act as signaling molecules to regulate redox-sensitive transcriptional factors, enzymes, oncogenes, and other downstream effectors. Thus, a thorough understanding the role of ROS as key mediators in leukemogenesis is likely to provide opportunities for improved pharmacological intervention.

This phase I study of the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer Consortium assessed dasatinib safety and efficacy in pediatric patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Escalating once-daily dasatinib doses (60 to 120 mg/m(2)) were administered to children (n = 58) with (i) imatinib-pretreated CML or Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymhoblastic leukemia (ALL) and (ii) treatment-refractory Ph-negative ALL or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Dasatinib safety and efficacy profiles compared favorably with those in adults. The most common drug-related nonhematologic adverse events were nausea (31%, all grades; 2%, grade 3 to 4), headache (22%, 3%), diarrhea (21%, 0%), and vomiting (17%, 2%). Of 17 patients with CML-CP, 14 (82%) achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and eight (47%) achieved major molecular response. After >/= 24 months of follow-up, median complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) durations were not reached. Of 17 patients with advanced-phase CML or Ph-positive ALL, six (35%) achieved confirmed CHR and 11 (65%) achieved CCyR. Median MCyR duration was 4.6 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 17.4 months).

This study describes changes in use, technique, and survival in a population-based cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 38,060 patients with hematologic malignancies or disorders who underwent first alloHCT in a US or Canadian center from 1994 to 2005 and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. RESULTS: AlloHCT as treatment for acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid leukemias (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas increased by 45%, from 2,520 to 3,668 patients annually. From 1994 to 2005, use of both peripheral (7% to 63%) [corrected] and cord blood increased (2% to 10%), whereas use of marrow decreased (90% to 27%). Despite a median age increase from 33 to 40 years and 165% [corrected] increase in unrelated donors for alloHCT, overall survival (OS) at day 100 significantly improved for patients with AML in first complete remission after myeloablative sibling alloHCT (85% to 94%; P < .001) and unrelated alloHCT (63% to 86%; P < .001); 1-year OS improved among those undergoing unrelated alloHCT (48% to 63%; P = .003) but not among those undergoing sibling alloHCT. Similar results were seen for ALL and MDS. Day-100 OS after cord blood alloHCT improved significantly from 60% to 78% (P < .001) for AML, ALL, MDS, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Use of reduced-intensity regimens increased, yielding OS rates similar to those of myeloablative regimens. CONCLUSION: Survival for those undergoing alloHCT has significantly improved over time. However, new approaches are needed to further improve 1-year OS.","['Hahn, Theresa', 'McCarthy, Philip L Jr', 'Hassebroek, Anna', 'Bredeson, Christopher', 'Gajewski, James L', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Isola, Luis M', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Lemaistre, Charles F', 'Loberiza, Fausto', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Joffe, Steven', 'Parsons, Susan', 'Majhail, Navneet S']","['Hahn T', 'McCarthy PL Jr', 'Hassebroek A', 'Bredeson C', 'Gajewski JL', 'Hale GA', 'Isola LM', 'Lazarus HM', 'Lee SJ', 'Lemaistre CF', 'Loberiza F', 'Maziarz RT', 'Rizzo JD', 'Joffe S', 'Parsons S', 'Majhail NS']","['National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, MN 55413, USA.']",['eng'],"['5U01HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSH234200637015C/PHS HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130528,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*mortality/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'United States/epidemiology', '*Unrelated Donors']",PMC3691359,,2013/05/30 06:00,2013/08/30 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.46.6193 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.46.6193 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jul 1;31(19):2437-49. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.46.6193.

Although many consider the standard RT regimen to be 45 Gy in 1.5 Gy twice-daily fractions, this has failed to gain widespread acceptance. We pooled data of patients assigned to receive daily RT of 70 Gy from three, consecutive prospective Cancer and Leukemia Group B L-SCLC cancer trials and report the results here. METHODS: All patients from consecutive Cancer and Leukemia Group B L-SCLC trials (39808, 30002, and 30206) using high-dosage daily RT with concurrent chemotherapy were included, and analyzed for toxicity, disease control, and survival. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were modeled using Cox proportional hazards models. Prognostic variables for OS-rate and PFS-rate were assessed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were included. The median follow-up was 78 months. Grade 3 or greater esophagitis was 23%. The median OS for pooled population was 19.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.7-22.3), and 5-year OS rate was 20% (95% CI: 16-27%). The 2-year PFS was 26% (95% CI: 21-32%). Multivariate analysis found younger age (p = 0.02; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.023; 95% CI: 21-32), and female sex (p = 0.02; HR:0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.94) independently associated with improved overall survival. CONCLUSION: Two-Gy daily RT to a total dosage of 70 Gy was well tolerated with similar survival to 45 Gy (1.5 Gy twice-daily). This experience may aid practitioners decide whether high-dosage daily RT with platinum-based chemotherapy is appropriate outside of a clinical trial.","['Salama, Joseph K', 'Hodgson, Lydia', 'Pang, Herbert', 'Urbanic, James J', 'Blackstock, A William', 'Schild, Steven E', 'Crawford, Jeffrey', 'Bogart, Jeffrey A', 'Vokes, Everett E']","['Salama JK', 'Hodgson L', 'Pang H', 'Urbanic JJ', 'Blackstock AW', 'Schild SE', 'Crawford J', 'Bogart JA', 'Vokes EE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Box 3085, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. joseph.salama@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['49DFR088MY (Platinum)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', '*Chemoradiotherapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Platinum/therapeutic use', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/mortality/*therapy']",PMC3822578,['NIHMS473344'],2013/05/30 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e318293d8a4 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)33444-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2013 Aug;8(8):1043-9. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e318293d8a4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,,,

Here we identify a novel activity for the anthracycline class of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors: histone eviction from open chromosomal areas. We show that anthracyclines promote histone eviction irrespective of their ability to induce DNA double-strand breaks. The histone variant H2AX, which is a key component of the DNA damage response, is also evicted by anthracyclines, and H2AX eviction is associated with attenuated DNA repair. Histone eviction deregulates the transcriptome in cancer cells and organs such as the heart, and can drive apoptosis of topoisomerase-negative acute myeloid leukaemia blasts in patients. We define a novel mechanism of action of anthracycline anticancer drugs doxorubicin and daunorubicin on chromatin biology, with important consequences for DNA damage responses, epigenetics, transcription, side effects and cancer therapy.","['Pang, Baoxu', 'Qiao, Xiaohang', 'Janssen, Lennert', 'Velds, Arno', 'Groothuis, Tom', 'Kerkhoven, Ron', 'Nieuwland, Marja', 'Ovaa, Huib', 'Rottenberg, Sven', 'van Tellingen, Olaf', 'Janssen, Jeroen', 'Huijgens, Peter', 'Zwart, Wilbert', 'Neefjes, Jacques']","['Pang B', 'Qiao X', 'Janssen L', 'Velds A', 'Groothuis T', 'Kerkhoven R', 'Nieuwland M', 'Ovaa H', 'Rottenberg S', 'van Tellingen O', 'Janssen J', 'Huijgens P', 'Zwart W', 'Neefjes J']","['Division of Cell Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066CX, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anthracyclines/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity/drug effects', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",PMC3674280,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms2921 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms2921 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Commun. 2013;4:1908. doi: 10.1038/ncomms2921.,,,,['GEO/GSE33634'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of this indicator allows the identification of factors contributing to the development of the illness and the final condition of affected children. OBJECTIVE: The operative experience results were described from data obtained by committee of analysis of institutional mortality by childhood acute leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formal reports of deaths in children under 15 due to acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia were provided to the National Cancer Institute of Colombia. A descriptive analysis of these reports from the period 2008-2010 was undertaken by the National Cancer Institute. Avoidability analysis was performed using the 1994 ""three delays"" model of Thaddeus and Maine. RESULTS: Of 24 deaths analyzed, 21 were caused by acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

CCS exhibits a peculiar histopathologic appearance, as it commonly manifests as granulomatous inflammation involving the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, with features of chronicity in the colon. Importantly, the treatment for CCS differs from that for acute graft-versus-host disease, which is commonly in the clinical differential diagnosis: CCS responds to antibiotic treatment, whereas acute graft-versus-host disease responds to immunosuppression. We describe here the case of a 36-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia who developed refractory diarrhea after cord blood transplant. Endoscopic biopsies of the stomach and colon revealed granulomatous inflammation, consisting of scattered ill-defined aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes, with associated mild neutrophilic inflammation and mildly increased epithelial cell apoptosis. In the colon, the granulomatous inflammation was associated with surface epithelial injury (including surface erosions) and contained occasional multinucleated epithelioid giant cells. Paneth cell metaplasia was present in the distal colon, but crypt architecture was preserved, and there was no basal lymphoplasmacytosis. Special stains and immunohistochemical stains for infectious organisms were negative. A diagnosis of CCS was made, and the patient promptly responded to treatment with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. We present this case to raise awareness among pathologists of this newly described entity, in order to facilitate its timely diagnosis and treatment.","['Gupta, Nitin K', 'Masia, Ricard']","['Gupta NK', 'Masia R']","['Gastrointestinal Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA009216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007191/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32DK007191/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09216./CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '140QMO216E (Metronidazole)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Ciprofloxacin/therapeutic use', 'Colitis/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Crohn Disease/etiology/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diarrhea/etiology/*pathology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Epithelioid Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/*pathology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Histiocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/surgery', 'Metronidazole/therapeutic use']",PMC3687023,['NIHMS451471'],2013/05/30 06:00,2013/08/16 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e31828a827a [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2013 Jul;37(7):1109-13. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31828a827a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been difficult to provide effective immunotherapy to improve outcomes for the majority of patients. Rhabdoviruses induce strong antiviral immune responses. We hypothesized that mice administered ex vivo rhabdovirus-infected ALL cells [immunotherapy by leukemia-oncotropic virus (iLOV)] would develop robust antileukemic immune responses capable of controlling ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Viral protein production, replication, and cytopathy were measured in human and murine ALL cells exposed to attenuated rhabdovirus. Survival following injection of graded amounts of ALL cells was compared between cohorts of mice administered gamma-irradiated rhabdovirus-infected ALL cells (iLOV) or multiple control vaccines to determine key immunotherapeutic components and characteristics. Host immune requirements were assessed in immunodeficient and bone marrow-transplanted mice or by adoptive splenocyte transfer from immunized donors. Antileukemic immune memory was ascertained by second leukemic challenge in long-term survivors. RESULTS: Human and murine ALL cells were infected and killed by rhabdovirus; this produced a potent antileukemia vaccine. iLOV protected mice from otherwise lethal ALL by developing durable leukemia-specific immune-mediated responses (P < 0.0001), which required an intact CTL compartment. Preexisting antiviral immunity augmented iLOV potency. Splenocytes from iLOV-vaccinated donors protected 60% of naive recipients from ALL challenge (P = 0.0001). Injecting leukemia cells activated by, or concurrent with, multiple Toll-like receptor agonists could not reproduce the protective effect of iLOV. Similarly, injecting uninfected irradiated viable, apoptotic, or necrotic leukemia cells with/without concurrent rhabdovirus administration was ineffective. CONCLUSION: Rhabdovirus-infected leukemia cells can be used to produce a vaccine that induces robust specific immunity against aggressive leukemia.","['Conrad, David P', 'Tsang, Jovian', 'Maclean, Meaghan', 'Diallo, Jean-Simon', 'Le Boeuf, Fabrice', 'Lemay, Chantal G', 'Falls, Theresa J', 'Parato, Kelley A', 'Bell, John C', 'Atkins, Harold L']","['Conrad DP', 'Tsang J', 'Maclean M', 'Diallo JS', 'Le Boeuf F', 'Lemay CG', 'Falls TJ', 'Parato KA', 'Bell JC', 'Atkins HL']","['Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Center for Cancer Therapeutics, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130528,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Rhabdoviridae/*physiology', 'Vero Cells']",,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/02/06 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-3199 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3199 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jul 15;19(14):3832-43. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3199.

Chemotherapy alone or combined-modality therapy are both acceptable standard treatment options for nonbulky early-stage HL. Combined-modality therapy is associated with more serious late effects and, in at least one study, showed inferior survival rates compared with chemotherapy alone. Modern radiotherapy fields and doses are likely to result in fewer complications, but given the common involvement of the mediastinum in HL, complete avoidance of the heart, lungs, and breasts in the radiotherapy field is unlikely. In patients receiving chemotherapy alone, four to six cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD), with fewer cycles being given to those with an early complete remission, is recommended. Three cycles of ABVD may be adequate in those with an early negative PET, but these results have been published only in abstract form. Current standards for combined-modality therapy include two cycles of ABVD and 20 Gy of involved field radiotherapy in those with a favorable risk profile and four cycles of ABVD plus 30 Gy for unfavorable HL in early-stage patients. Standard of care for bulky early-stage HL remains combined-modality therapy. Whether an interim PET will allow selection of patients with nonbulky HL who will benefit most from consolidative radiotherapy is still under investigation.","['Bartlett, Nancy L']",['Bartlett NL'],"['From the Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

A combination of graft manipulation, donor selection, fine-tuning of conditioning regimens, and use of lower and novel forms of immunosuppression following transplant has maximized the tolerability of alloHSCT in children. This outcome has facilitated new advances in disease-specific transplant regimens that seek to amplify the antitumor effects of the allograft, while reducing transplant-related mortality. However, disease relapse remains the preeminent challenge to the success of transplantation as a modality for successful treatment of high-risk disease. Separating graft versus host disease (GVHD) from graft versus leukemia (GVL) remains the most significant obstacle to enhancing disease-free survival. However, with increased clarity and discrimination in the effector mechanisms responsible for GVHD and/or GVL in patients of all ages, a new wave of clinical trials has become feasible that harnesses GVL effects to treat patients with high-risk myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. Exciting progress is being made in the use of alloHSCT with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) in almost all forms of pediatric hematologic malignancies.

A significant fraction of patients with clinical resistance are recognized to harbor point mutations/substitutions in the Abl kinase domain, which limit or preclude drug binding and activity. Recent data suggest that compound mutations may develop as well. Proper identification of clinical resistance and prudent screening for all causes of resistance, ranging from adherence to therapy to Abl kinase mutations, is crucial to success with kinase inhibitor therapy. There is currently an array of Abl kinase inhibitors with unique toxicity and activity profiles available, allowing for individualizing therapy beginning with initial choice at diagnosis and as well informed choice of subsequent therapy in the face of toxicity or resistance, with or without Abl kinase domain mutations. Recent studies continue to highlight the merits of increasingly aggressive initial therapy to subvert resistance and importance of early response to identify need for change in therapy. Proper knowledge and navigation amongst novel therapy options and consideration of drug toxicities, individual patient characteristics, disease response, and vigilance for development of resistance are necessary elements of optimized care for the patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Mauro, Michael J']",['Mauro MJ'],"['From the Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

In 2007, the first-in-class agent INC18424, ruxolitinib, JAKafi, or JAKAVI was first tested in patients with intermediate-risk 2 or high-risk myelofibrosis regardless of whether they possessed the JAK2V617F mutation. Patients treated with this agent had major reduction in splenomegaly as well as impressive reduction, and in some cases resolution, of symptoms. This study was followed by the two Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK Inhibitor Therapy (COMFORT) trials (the first-ever phase III trials in myelofibrosis), which confirmed results in these aspects were superior to either placebo or standard care, and updated results show a survival advantage with this therapy. This paper discusses these results and data from other JAK inhibitors while speculating on the future of these therapies. It also reflects on the fact that the true targets and agents' mode of action are uncertain. Unlike targeted therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), these agents do not deliver molecular remission, and it is not clear whether their predominant benefit is mediated via JAK2, JAK1, or both. Nonetheless, the advent of the JAK inhibitor is a welcome advance and has made a dramatic improvement to the therapeutic landscape of these conditions.","['Keohane, Clodagh', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'Harrison, Claire']","['Keohane C', 'Mesa R', 'Harrison C']","[""From the Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Phoenix, AZ.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Medication adherence is difficult to assess and there is no gold standard of measurement. The act of measuring adherence can affect outcomes. Medication noncompliance is common, and is estimated to be 50% in treatment of chronic diseases. Studies have shown that women initiate adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer 64% to 88% of the time when prescribed. Of those who initiate therapy, 50% to 80% are adherent for the prescribed duration, depending on the study. Patients noncompliant with adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer have worse overall survival than their counterparts. Suboptimal treatment responses in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are also associated with medication noncompliance. Poor adherence can also affect clinical trial results, leading to inaccuracies of treatment efficacy. Barriers to compliance can occur on the individual, cultural, or system level. Examples of specific barriers are side effects, cost and access to medication, and individual health beliefs. Specific populations, including racial minorities, elderly patients, and very young patients, may be at higher risk for medication noncompliance. Strategies to improve compliance are multifactorial and include improvement of patient education, reduction of treatment side effects, interventions to alter behavior, and changes in public policy to improve financial barriers to treatment. Technology has been an effective tool in improving compliance in noncancer-related illness, and ongoing studies are evaluating its role in the oncology population.","['Accordino, Melissa K', 'Hershman, Dawn L']","['Accordino MK', 'Hershman DL']","['From the Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Over the past several decades, ADCs have been evaluated in a variety of preclinical models of hematologic malignancies, as well as early-phase clinical trials with limited success. More recently, advancements in linkage technology, improvements in cytotoxin selection, and use of smaller conjugates containing partial rather than complete antibodies have drastically improved the potential clinical value of ADCs.

We explored the expression profile of LEF1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determined its specific prognostic significance in this disease. The LEF1 mRNA level in patients with previously untreated AML was significantly higher than in normal controls. Patients with AML with relatively higher LEF1 expression were more likely to achieve a complete remission (CR) following induction therapy in comparison to those with a lower LEF1 level. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that primary AML samples with AML1-ETO or PML-RARalpha have a higher LEF1 level compared with those without each fusion gene. High LEF1 expression predicts a significantly better overall survival for patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. High LEF1 level was associated with a favorable relapse-free survival in patients with FLT3-ITD wild-type. Finally, a scoring system based on LEF1 level and mutation status of FLT3-ITD or NPM1 is reliable to predict the outcome for AML with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Our results indicate that LEF1 contributes to the pathophysiology of AML and could serve as a novel predictor of better treatment response. LEF1 level may be incorporated into an improved risk classification system for certain specific subtypes of AML.","['Fu, Yuan', 'Zhu, Huayuan', 'Wu, Wei', 'Xu, Jiadai', 'Chen, Tingmei', 'Xu, Bei', 'Qian, Sixuan', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Liu, Peng']","['Fu Y', 'Zhu H', 'Wu W', 'Xu J', 'Chen T', 'Xu B', 'Qian S', 'Li J', 'Liu P']",['Department of Hematology.'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130708,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.805759 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Feb;55(2):371-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.805759.

One HMA, azacitidine (Vidaza(R), Celgene Corp.), has demonstrated improved survival versus conventional care regimens in patients with intermediate-2/high-risk MDS and AML (20-30% blasts) and has a favorable tolerability profile. Emerging evidence indicates that azacitidine can have an immunomodulatory effect by, for example, increasing functional regulatory T-cell (Treg) numbers and killer-cell-immunoglobulin-like receptor expression. Allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (allo HPCT) is the only potentially curative treatment approach in patients with advanced MDS or AML. Unfortunately, allo HPCT in these settings is limited because most patients are ineligible due to age/comorbidities, or are at a high risk of treatment failure due to disease relapse. Recent studies have shown that azacitidine after allo HPCT increases Treg numbers while inducing a cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell response, suggesting a potential mechanism for augmenting the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect without increasing graft-versushost- disease (GVHD). In patients at a high risk of relapse following allo HPCT, pre-emptive azacitidine may help prevent/delay relapse. For patients who have relapsed following allo HPCT, azacitidine may be a salvage therapy option, either as monotherapy or in combination with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). In this mini-review, we discuss these emerging clinical data for HMAs in the post-allo HPCT regimens and highlight the possible future role of azacitidine in this setting.","['Martino, Massimo', 'Fedele, Roberta', 'Moscato, Tiziana', 'Ronco, Francesca']","['Martino M', 'Fedele R', 'Moscato T', 'Ronco F']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera BMM, Via Cantaffio, 89133 Reggio Calabria, Italy. maxmartino@live.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['CCDT-EPUB-20130522-2 [pii]', '10.2174/15680096113139990005 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2013 Jul;13(6):661-9. doi: 10.2174/15680096113139990005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Totally 60 female Kunming mice were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. BZD was perfused by gastric tube to mice in the experimental group, twice daily. Meanwhile, mice in the control group were administered with normal saline by gastrogavage. Mice were sacrificed on the 10th day and the 20th day of medication respectively, 15 mice each time in each group. The serum levels of estradiol and progesterone were detected by radioimmunoassay. The morphological changes of uterus and ovary were observed using HE staining. The expressions of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and calcitionin (CT) were determined using immunohistochemical assay. RESULTS: Compared with the control group at the same time point, the weights of uterus and ovary increased, the serum levels of estradiol and progestogen increased, the expressions of LIF, CT, and EGF increased in the experimental group on the 10th day and the 20th day of medication (P <0.05, P <0.01). Better results were shown on the 20th day of medication (P <0.05). Histological results showed increased ovarian follicle numbers, increased endometrial gland numbers, endometrial hyperplasia (stratiform arranged), and increased stromal cells in the experimental group, especially on the 20th day of medication. CONCLUSION: BZD could improve the reproductive capacity by advancing the development of generative organs, promoting the secretion of estradiol and progestogen and the follicular growth, and increasing the receptivity of endometrium.","['Li, Xiao-ni', 'Li, Ya-xuan', 'Zhou, Ji-hai', 'Tan, Ji-chun']","['Li XN', 'Li YX', 'Zhou JH', 'Tan JC']","['Centre for Auxiliary Human Reproduction, Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Estradiol/metabolism', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organ Size', 'Ovary/*drug effects', 'Progesterone/metabolism', 'Uterus/*drug effects']",,,2013/05/30 06:00,2014/04/11 06:00,['2013/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2013 Mar;33(3):365-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the emergence of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas (SCCs) and secondary melanomas in patients on BRAF-inhibitor therapy have been well described, reports are emerging of additional secondary premalignant and malignant events, including RAS-mutant leukaemia, the metastatic recurrence of RAS-mutant colorectal cancer and the development of gastric and colonic polyps. In most cases, paradoxical MAPK activation--resulting from the BRAF-inhibitor-mediated homodimerization and heterodimerization of nonmutant RAF isoforms--seems to underlie the development of these secondary tumours. Although evidence supports that therapy with the simultaneous administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors abrogates the onset of treatment-induced SCCs, whether combination treatment will limit the emergence of all BRAF-inhibitor-driven pathologies is unclear. In this Review, we describe the clinical and mechanistic manifestations of secondary cancers that have thus far been observed to arise as a consequence of BRAF inhibition. We discuss the concept of pre-existing populations of partly transformed cells with malignant potential that might be present in various organ systems, and the rationale for novel therapeutic strategies for the management of BRAF-inhibitor-induced neoplasia.","['Gibney, Geoffrey T', 'Messina, Jane L', 'Fedorenko, Inna V', 'Sondak, Vernon K', 'Smalley, Keiran S M']","['Gibney GT', 'Messina JL', 'Fedorenko IV', 'Sondak VK', 'Smalley KS']","['Department of Cutaneous Oncology, The Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA161107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA161107-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143970-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20130528,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

Moreover, during spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, a substantial increase in GALIG gene expression is observed: GALIG still opposes MCL-1. Finally, in bone marrow and peripheral blood cells from patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia type 2, the level of GALIG transcripts is massively down-regulated when compared to their normal counterparts, while MCL-1 is expressed to the same extent.

JMJD3 is a histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylase, a histone mark associated with transcriptional repression and activation of a diverse set of genes. The present study assessed stable JMJD3 knockdown (KD)-dependent proteomic profiling in human leukemia monocyte (THP-1) cells to analyze the JMJD3-mediated differential changes of marker expression in inflammatory cells. To analyze the protein expression profile of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells, we employed matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Additionally, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was applied to establish the molecular networks. A comparative proteomic profile was determined in TNF-alpha-treated both of JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells and THP-1 scrambled (sc) cells. The expression of tripartite motif protein (TRIM5), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glia maturation factor-gamma (GMFG), caspase recruitment domain family, member 14 (CARMA2), and dUTP pyrophosphatase were significantly down-regulated, whereas heat shock protein beta-1 (HspB1) and prohibition were significantly up-regulated in JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells. The molecular and signaling networks of the differentially expressed proteins in JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells were determined by IPA. The molecular network signatures and functional proteomics obtained in this study may facilitate the suppression of different key inflammatory regulators through JMJD3-attenuation, which would be crucial to evaluate potential therapeutic targets and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of JMJD3-kd dependent effects in THP-1 cells.","['Das, Amitabh', 'Das, Nando Dulal', 'Jung, Kyoung Hwa', 'Park, Ji Hyun', 'Lee, Hyung Tae', 'Han, DalMuri', 'Choi, Mi Ran', 'Kang, Sung Chul', 'Chai, Young Gyu']","['Das A', 'Das ND', 'Jung KH', 'Park JH', 'Lee HT', 'Han D', 'Choi MR', 'Kang SC', 'Chai YG']","['Department of Molecular & Life Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, Republic of Korea. amitabhdas.kn@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130525,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (NUDC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6B protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteome/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,,2013/05/29 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2013/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(13)00164-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2013.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2013 Nov;56(1-2):113-22. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2013.04.013.

Cytotoxin 1 (CTX1)from Naja atra Cantor venom is a 60 amino acid, 6698 Da protein with as yet untested anticancer efficacy and cell selectivity. We tested the toxicity of CTX1 on a number of cancer cell lines (MCF-7, P388, K562, and H22) and on one normal human cell line (16HBE). The rank order of cytotoxicity was MCF-7 > P388 approximately K562 >H22 approximately 16HBE, indicating that the effect of CTX1 on certain cancer cell types was relatively selective.Treatment with CTX1 greatly prolonged the survival of P388 ascites tumors bearing KM mice compared to cyclophosphamide treatment. Cell viability, apoptosis, and lysosomal permeability assays all demonstrated that CTX1 induced dose- and time-dependent cell death, with most cells exhibiting the morphological and biochemical features of late apoptosis and necrosis. Mitochondrial membrane potential was lost in CTX1-treated P388 cells. In addition, CTX1 induced an increase in both lysosomal membrane permeability and cathepsin B protease activity. These analyses reveal that CTX1 possesses significant and selective anticancer activity, likely by inducing programmed cell death through mitochondrial and/or lysosomal pathways.","['Wu, Minyan', 'Ming, Wei', 'Tang, Ya', 'Zhou, Shengming', 'Kong, Tianhan', 'Dong, Weihua']","['Wu M', 'Ming W', 'Tang Y', 'Zhou S', 'Kong T', 'Dong W']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510182, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '0 (cobra cytotoxin I)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cathepsin B/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Elapid Venoms/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Elapidae', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/*drug effects', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Permeability']",,,2013/05/29 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/05/29 06:00'],"['2013/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1142/S0192415X13500456 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2013;41(3):643-63. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X13500456.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we determined interleukin 21 (IL21) function in CLL and showed that IL21 and interleukin 4 (IL4) act co-operatively to promote leukaemic cell proliferation without apoptosis or differentiation We further show that IL21 increased side population (SP) cells, which are associated with resistance to chemotherapy and increased self-renewal capacity in CLL. IL21 and IL4 are the major cytokines produced by the recently described CD4(+) T follicular helper (Tfh) cell subset. Determination of Tfh cells in peripheral blood showed that patients had significantly increased numbers as compared to normal subjects although no association was found between Tfh numbers and IGHV gene mutational status or clinical stage. Our data suggests that the Tfh cytokines, IL4 and IL21, contribute to driving leukaemic cell proliferation in the lymph node microenvironment, and may contribute to the specific production of cells resistant to conventional chemotherapy.

Aberrations in the AML1 gene are frequently found in human leukemia. To better understand AML1 and its potential utility for diagnosis and therapy, we obtained RNA aptamers that bind specifically to the AML1 Runt domain. Enzymatic probing and NMR analyses revealed that Apt1-S, which is a truncated variant of one of the aptamers, has a CACG tetraloop and two stem regions separated by an internal loop. All the isolated aptamers were found to contain the conserved sequence motif 5'-NNCCAC-3' and 5'-GCGMGN'N'-3' (M:A or C; N and N' form Watson-Crick base pairs). The motif contains one AC mismatch and one base bulged out. Mutational analysis of Apt1-S showed that three guanines of the motif are important for Runt binding as are the three guanines of RDE, which are directly recognized by three arginine residues of the Runt domain. Mutational analyses of the Runt domain revealed that the amino acid residues used for Apt1-S binding were similar to those used for RDE binding. Furthermore, the aptamer competed with RDE for binding to the Runt domain in vitro. These results demonstrated that the Runt domain of the AML1 protein binds to the motif of the aptamer that mimics DNA. Our findings should provide new insights into RNA function and utility in both basic and applied sciences.","['Fukunaga, Junichi', 'Nomura, Yusuke', 'Tanaka, Yoichiro', 'Amano, Ryo', 'Tanaka, Taku', 'Nakamura, Yoshikazu', 'Kawai, Gota', 'Sakamoto, Taiichi', 'Kozu, Tomoko']","['Fukunaga J', 'Nomura Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Amano R', 'Tanaka T', 'Nakamura Y', 'Kawai G', 'Sakamoto T', 'Kozu T']","['Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Ina, Saitama 362-0806, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130524,United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)']",IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide', 'Base Sequence', '*Conserved Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'Guanine/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3683927,,2013/05/28 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['rna.037879.112 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.037879.112 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2013 Jul;19(7):927-36. doi: 10.1261/rna.037879.112.

A single cycle of alemtuzumab, administered over 5 days, depletes lymphocytes. Reconstitution causes prolonged alterations in the lymphocyte repertoire, with relatively increased regulatory T-cell numbers and reduced naive T cells. It is currently approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is being considered for licensing for multiple sclerosis (MS).When first used, alemtuzumab successfully reduced relapses and new lesion formation based on magnetic resonance imaging in people with progressive MS, but this cohort continued to accumulate disability, associated with progressive cerebral atrophy, presumably due to axonal degeneration. From this experience, we advocated that immunotherapies should be given early in the course of the disease. Since then, one phase II and two phase III trials have shown that alemtuzumab reduces the relapse rate, compared with the active comparator interferon beta-1a (IFNbeta-1a), in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced MS up to 10 years from disease onset. Furthermore, in two of these trials, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of accumulating disability compared with IFNbeta-1a; indeed alemtuzumab treatment led to an improvement in disability and reduction in cerebral atrophy. Safety issues are infusion-associated reactions, mainly controlled by methyl-prednisolone, antihistamines, and antipyretics; mild to moderate infections; and autoimmunity. After 5 years, 30 to 40% of alemtuzumab patients have developed autoimmunity, largely against the thyroid gland, but rarely (2%) against platelets in immune thrombocytopenia, and in a few cases, Goodpasture's renal syndrome.Alemtuzumab is an effective therapy for early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, offering disability improvement at least to 5 years after treatment. Its use requires careful monitoring so that potentially serious side effects can be treated early and effectively.","['Coles, Alasdair J']",['Coles AJ'],"[""Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, United Kingdom. ajc1020@medschl.cam.ac.uk""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130525,United States,Semin Neurol,Seminars in neurology,8111343,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/immunology/*metabolism', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1343797 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Neurol. 2013 Feb;33(1):66-73. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1343797.

Therapy based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been developed to increase the selectivity of cytotoxic agents by conjugating them with a mAb. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is a conjugate of a cytotoxic agent, a calicheamicin derivative, linked to a recombinant humanized mAb directed against the CD33 antigen, which is expressed on leukemia cells from more than 90 % of patients with AML. This conjugated mAb was introduced following promising results from phase I and II studies. However, the initial phase III study did not confirm the efficacy of GO in combination with conventional chemotherapies. Several subsequent phase III studies have shown the efficacy of GO in favorable and intermediate risk AML. Several resistance mechanisms against GO have been reported. Multidrug resistant (MDR) P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a trans-membrane glycoprotein that pumps out many anti-leukemic agents from cells, also affects GO. For this reasons, GO has been used in combination with MDR modifiers, such as cyclosporine, and in cases without P-gp. Several investigators have reported successful results of the use of GO in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). GO has also been described as effective in cases relapsed after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic acid and conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The efficacy of GO will be studied mainly in a favorable risk of AML, such as core binding factor leukemia and APL.

For patients, the convenience of self-administration constitutes a major benefit associated with oral therapy. For clinicians, however, the transition from parenteral to oral therapy has resulted in concerns about adherence to therapy, its monitoring, and its effects on clinical outcomes. Several studies have demonstrated that imatinib is effective at improving overall survival and/or recurrence-free survival in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors and chronic myeloid leukemia (primary and metastatic disease). Despite the survival benefit and the favorable toxicity profile of imatinib, however, adherence to imatinib remains poor. Herein, we review the evidence showing the effects of nonadherence on patient outcomes as well as data indicating that adherence to imatinib (and oral anticancer therapy in general) is suboptimal. We also highlight factors that may contribute to nonadherence and suggest key steps that can be implemented by the multidisciplinary medical team to overcome the daily challenges of adherence. Improving adherence to imatinib depends on open communication and comprehensive patient education. All of this is essential to maximize benefits from therapy and improve clinical outcomes for our patients.","['Al-Barrak, Jasem', 'Cheung, Winson Y']","['Al-Barrak J', 'Cheung WY']","['Division of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130525,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Medication Adherence', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/05/14 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-013-1831-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2013 Aug;21(8):2351-7. doi: 10.1007/s00520-013-1831-6.

Data were analysed from 507 patients (313 males; 194 females; median age 15 years; 318 with ALL; 188 with AML; 1 case not recorded). Besides 128 autologous transplants, donors included 192 matched siblings, 74 mismatched family members and 113 unrelated individuals. Autologous and allogeneic transplants were analysed separately. Median follow-up was 40.1 months. TBI schedules and HSCT type were closely related. Uni- and multi-variate analyses showed no parameter was significant for OS or relapse in autologous transplantation. Multivariate analysis showed type of transplant and disease impacted significantly on OS in allogeneic transplantation. Disease, GVHD and TBI dose were risk factors for relapse. This analysis illustrates that Italian Transplant Centre use of TBI is in line with international practice. Most Centres adopted a hyperfractionated schedule that is used worldwide (12 Gy in six fractions over 3 days), which appears to have become standard. TBI doses impacted significantly upon relapse rates.","['Aristei, C', 'Santucci, A', 'Corvo, R', 'Gardani, G', 'Ricardi, U', 'Scarzello, G', 'Magrini, S M', 'Donato, V', 'Falcinelli, L', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'Aversa, F', 'Barbieri, E']","['Aristei C', 'Santucci A', 'Corvo R', 'Gardani G', 'Ricardi U', 'Scarzello G', 'Magrini SM', 'Donato V', 'Falcinelli L', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Locatelli F', 'Aversa F', 'Barbieri E']","['Radiation Oncology Section, University of Perugia and Perugia General Hospital, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130527,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Autografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', '*Unrelated Donors']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201366 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2013.66 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jul;48(7):908-14. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2013.66.

For patients with chemo refractory disease, or recurrent disease following autologous hematopoietic SCT (auto-HCT), the prognosis is poor, with no consensus on the optimal therapy. Currently, owing to the graft vs lymphoma effect, hematopoietic allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the only potentially curative option for such patients. In addition, many patients who are considered today for auto-HCT actually have a low likelihood of benefit. For example, a patient with prior rituximab exposure who relapses within 1 year of diagnosis and has a second-line age-adjusted International Prognosis Index of 2 or 3 at relapse has a <25% chance of being cured by auto-HCT. It is possible that such patients may be better served with an allo-HCT. Unfortunately, in many cases, allo-HCT applicability is limited by patient age, comorbidities, performance status and treatment-related toxicities. Recent attempts to improve the efficacy of auto-HCT, such as incorporating radio-immunotherapy into the conditioning regimen, have not resulted in improved outcomes. However, incorporation of novel agents such as anti-programmed death-1 antibodies as maintenance therapy after auto-HCT show promise. Allo-HCT in relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients can result in a 30-40% PFS rate at 3 years, in part due to a graft vs DLBCL effect. While reduced-intensity/non-myeloablative conditioning is increasingly being used, certain patients may benefit from myeloablative conditioning. We present an algorithm intended to discriminate which relapsed and refractory DLBCL patients are most likely to benefit from auto-HCT vs allo-HCT. New approaches, using novel agents that target the molecular heterogeneity in DLBCL, will be an essential component of moving the field forward. Lastly, we propose a prospective registry-based study as the only feasible mechanism to define the optimal position of allo-HCT in the overall treatment strategy for DLBCL. It is hoped that this review will promote the development of prospective multicenter efforts to determine whether such patients do, in fact, benefit from earlier and/or more effective implementation of allo-HCT.","['Klyuchnikov, E', 'Bacher, U', 'Kroll, T', 'Shea, T C', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Bredeson, C', 'Fenske, T S']","['Klyuchnikov E', 'Bacher U', 'Kroll T', 'Shea TC', 'Lazarus HM', 'Bredeson C', 'Fenske TS']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', '1] Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany [2] MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130527,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Rituximab', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201372 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2013.72 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2014 Jan;49(1):1-7. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2013.72.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms human B-lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines with unlimited growth potential in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that newly EBV-infected cells exhibit multiple signs of telomere dysfunction, including the occurrence of extra-chromosomal telomeres, telomere fusion and telomere length heterogeneity, and undergo progressive increase in telomere length without a parallel increase in telomerase activity. This phenotype is accompanied by the accumulation of telomere-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and telomeric-sister chromatid exchange, suggesting that EBV infection promotes the activation of ALT. Newly infected cells also display a significant reduction of telomere-associated TRF2 and express low levels of TRF1, TRF2, POT1 and ATRX, pointing to telomere de-protection as an important correlate of ALT activation. Collectively, these findings highlight the involvement of recombination-dependent mechanisms for maintenance of telomere homeostasis in EBV-induced B-cell immortalization.","['Kamranvar, S A', 'Chen, X', 'Masucci, M G']","['Kamranvar SA', 'Chen X', 'Masucci MG']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130527,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (POT1 protein, human)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (TERF2 protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*virology', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*genetics', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Telomere Homeostasis/*genetics', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/metabolism', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",PMC3898310,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013189 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.189 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Dec 5;32(49):5522-30. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.189.

A principal signaling mediator of prolactin, Stat5, promotes cellular differentiation of breast cancer cells in vitro, and loss of active Stat5 in tumors is associated with antiestrogen therapy failure in patients. In luminal breast cancer, progesterone induces a cytokeratin-5 (CK5)-positive basal cell-like population. This population possesses characteristics of tumor stem cells including quiescence, therapy resistance and tumor-initiating capacity. Here we report that prolactin counteracts induction of the CK5-positive population by the synthetic progestin (Pg) R5020 in luminal breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. CK5-positive cells were chemoresistant as determined by fourfold reduced rate of apoptosis following docetaxel exposure. Pg-induction of CK5 was preceded by marked upregulation of BCL6, an oncogene and transcriptional repressor critical for the maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells. Knockdown of BCL6 prevented induction of CK5-positive cell population by Pg. Prolactin suppressed Pg-induced BCL6 through Jak2-Stat5 but not Erk- or Akt-dependent pathways. In premenopausal but not postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, tumor protein levels of CK5 correlated positively with BCL6, and high BCL6 or CK5 protein levels were associated with unfavorable clinical outcome. Suppression of Pg-induction of CK5-positive cells represents a novel prodifferentiation effect of prolactin in breast cancer. The present progress may have direct implications for breast cancer progression and therapy as loss of prolactin receptor-Stat5 signaling occurs frequently and BCL6 inhibitors currently being evaluated for lymphomas may have value for breast cancer.","['Sato, T', 'Tran, T H', 'Peck, A R', 'Girondo, M A', 'Liu, C', 'Goodman, C R', 'Neilson, L M', 'Freydin, B', 'Chervoneva, I', 'Hyslop, T', 'Kovatich, A J', 'Hooke, J A', 'Shriver, C D', 'Fuchs, S Y', 'Rui, H']","['Sato T', 'Tran TH', 'Peck AR', 'Girondo MA', 'Liu C', 'Goodman CR', 'Neilson LM', 'Freydin B', 'Chervoneva I', 'Hyslop T', 'Kovatich AJ', 'Hooke JA', 'Shriver CD', 'Fuchs SY', 'Rui H']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'MDR Global Systems, LLC, Windber, PA, USA.', 'Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Animal Biology and Mari Lowe Center for Comparative Oncology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA118740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P30CA56036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA092900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA056036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130527,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Keratin-5)', '0 (Progesterone Congeners)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9XE0V2SQYX (Promegestone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Keratin-5/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Premenopause', 'Progesterone/physiology', 'Progesterone Congeners/pharmacology', 'Prolactin/*physiology', 'Promegestone/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",PMC3913798,['NIHMS550119'],2013/05/28 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013172 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Apr 24;33(17):2215-24. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.172.

Modulation of the transcriptional control of cellular genes by HTLV-1 is thought to be associated with the development of ATL. The viral protein HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper factor (HBZ) has been shown to dysregulate the activity of cellular transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate that HBZ is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway through an association with growth arrest and DNA damage gene 34 (GADD34). The N-terminal region of HBZ interacts with the C-terminal region of GADD34. HBZ contains a functional nuclear export signal (NES) sequence within its N-terminal region and it is exported from the nucleus via the CRM1-dependent pathway. Nuclear export of HBZ is essential for its interaction with GADD34 and increased phosphorylation of S6 kinase, which is an established downstream target of the mTOR pathway. Starvation-induced autophagy is significantly suppressed by the overexpression of HBZ. These findings indicate that HBZ is actively exported to the cytoplasm, where it dysregulates the function of cellular factors.","['Mukai, R', 'Ohshima, T']","['Mukai R', 'Ohshima T']","['Faculty of Engineering, Tokushima Bunri University, Sanuki, Kagawa, Japan.', '1] Faculty of Engineering, Tokushima Bunri University, Sanuki, Kagawa, Japan [2] Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science at Kagawa Campus, Tokushima Bunri University, Sanuki, Kagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130527,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Autophagy', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Export Signals', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/07/10 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013181 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.181 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 May 1;33(18):2317-28. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.181.

During embryogenesis, LMO2 is also expressed in developing tail and limb buds, an expression pattern we now show to be recapitulated in transgenic mice by an enhancer in LMO2 intron 4. Limb bud expression depended on a cluster of HOX binding sites, while posterior tail expression required the HOX sites and two E-boxes. Given the importance of both LMO2 and HOX genes in acute leukaemias, we further demonstrated that the regulatory hierarchy of HOX control of LMO2 is activated in leukaemia mouse models as well as in patient samples. Moreover, Lmo2 knock-down impaired the growth of leukaemic cells, and high LMO2 expression at diagnosis correlated with poor survival in cytogenetically normal AML patients. Taken together, these results establish a regulatory hierarchy of HOX control of LMO2 in normal development, which can be resurrected during leukaemia development. Redeployment of embryonic regulatory hierarchies in an aberrant context is likely to be relevant in human pathologies beyond the specific example of ectopic activation of LMO2.","['Calero-Nieto, F J', 'Joshi, A', 'Bonadies, N', 'Kinston, S', 'Chan, W-I', 'Gudgin, E', 'Pridans, C', 'Landry, J-R', 'Kikuchi, J', 'Huntly, B J', 'Gottgens, B']","['Calero-Nieto FJ', 'Joshi A', 'Bonadies N', 'Kinston S', 'Chan WI', 'Gudgin E', 'Pridans C', 'Landry JR', 'Kikuchi J', 'Huntly BJ', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['079249/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0900729/1/NC3RS_/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction', 'of Animals in Research/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom', '12765/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '100140/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130527,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/deficiency/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Conserved Sequence', 'E-Box Elements', 'Extremities/embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Mesoderm/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*embryology/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",PMC3898495,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013175 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Nov 28;32(48):5471-80. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.175.

We retrospectively analysed outcomes of 70 patients with relapsed, intermediate-risk karyotype AML who received a uniform reinduction regimen, with respect to FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status and first complete remission (CR1) duration. CR1 duration, but not molecular status, was significantly correlated with CR2 rate. On univariate analysis, patients with mutated FLT3-ITD (FLT3+) had significantly worse overall survival (OS) compared with those with neither an NPM1 nor FLT3-ITD mutation (NPM1-/FLT3-). On multivariate analysis, shorter CR1 duration was significantly correlated with inferior OS at relapse (P<0.0001), while FLT3 and NPM1 mutation status and age were not significantly correlated with OS. Patients who subsequently underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) had a superior OS regardless of CR1 duration, but outcomes were better in patients with CR1 duration>12 months.

However, this disease is very rare in Asian countries. It is not clear whether the mechanisms of development of CLL in Caucasians and Asians are the same. We compared genetic abnormalities in Asian and Caucasian CLL using 250k GeneChip arrays. Both Asian and Caucasian CLL had four common genetic abnormalities: deletion of 13q14.3, trisomy 12, abnormalities of ATM (11q) and abnormalities of 17p. Interestingly, trisomy 12 and deletion of 13q14.3 were mutually exclusive in both groups. We also found that deletions of miR 34b/34c (11q), caspase 1/4/5 (11q), Rb1 (13q) and DLC1 (8p) are common in both ethnic groups. Asian CLL more frequently had gain of 3q and 18q.

In this study, we investigated the effects of using the photosensitizer methylene blue (MB) in PDT in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. We found that MB enhances PDT-induced apoptosis in association with downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In MB-PDT-treated A549 cells, we observed PARP cleavage, procaspase-3 activation, downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Western blot data showed that phosphorylation of p38 was increased in MB-PDT-treated A549 cells, indicating that several signaling molecules participate in the apoptotic cascade. Our data also showed that apoptotic cell death in MB-PDT-treated cells occurred through a series of steps beginning with the photochemical generation of ROS. Demonstrating the role of ROS, pretreatment of A549 cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) followed by MB-PDT resulted in increased cell viability and reduced proteolytic cleavage of PARP.","['Lim, Eun Jin', 'Oak, Chul-Ho', 'Heo, Jeonghoon', 'Kim, Young-Ho']","['Lim EJ', 'Oak CH', 'Heo J', 'Kim YH']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Immunology, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130524,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Methylene Blue/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/02/28 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2494 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Aug;30(2):856-62. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2494.

The odds ratios for the CYP1A1 polymorphisms and leukemia risk were calculated. The cumulative evidence in genetic associations was graded by using the Venice criteria of the Human Genome Epidemiology Network (Atlanta, Georgia). The results showed that the cumulative evidence was moderate for the association of the CYP1A1*2A variant with leukemia in Caucasians and with childhood acute lymphoid leukemia in Caucasians. In addition, there was moderate evidence that children who carry both the CYP1A1*2A variant and the glutathione S-transferase M1 null genotype have an increased risk of acute lymphoid leukemia. For the CYP1A1*2C polymorphism, the cumulative evidence of an association with leukemia risk was moderate for adults and weak for children. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated an interaction between the CYP1A1*2C polymorphism and age.

Under these conditions, phosphorylation at Thr161 and dephosphorylation at Tyr15 of Cdk1, upregulation of cyclin B1 level, histone H1 phosphorylation, Cdc25C phosphorylation at Thr-48, Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Thr-56 and Ser-70, Mcl-1 phosphorylation, and Bim phosphorylation were detected in the presence of Bcl-2 overexpression. However, the 17alpha-E2-induced upregulation of Bak levels, activation of Bak, activation of caspase-3, and PARP degradation were abrogated by Bcl-2 overexpression. In the presence of the G1/S blocking agent hydroxyurea, 17alpha-E2 failed to induce G2/M arrest and all apoptotic events including Cdk1 activation and phosphorylation of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bim. The 17alpha-E2-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins and mitochondrial apoptotic events were suppressed by a Cdk1 inhibitor but not by aurora A and aurora B kinase inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis showed that an aberrant bipolar microtubule array, incomplete chromosome congression at the metaphase plate, and prometaphase arrest, which was reversible, were the underlying factors for 17alpha-E2-induced mitotic arrest. The in vitro microtubule polymerization assay showed that 17alpha-E2 could directly inhibit microtubule formation. These results show that the apoptogenic activity of 17alpha-E2 was due to the impaired mitotic spindle assembly causing prometaphase arrest and prolonged Cdk1 activation, the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bim, and the activation of Bak and mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade.","['Han, Cho Rong', 'Jun, Do Youn', 'Kim, Yoon Hee', 'Lee, Ji Young', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Han CR', 'Jun do Y', 'Kim YH', 'Lee JY', 'Kim YH']","['College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130523,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Estrogens/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prometaphase/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(13)00200-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.05.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Oct;1833(10):2220-32. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.05.016.

Elesclomol strongly binds copper and may be exerting its cell growth inhibitory effects by generating copper-mediated oxidative stress. Nickel(II) and platinum(II) complexes of elesclomol were synthesized and characterized in order to investigate if these biologically redox inactive metal complexes could also inhibit cell growth. The nickel(II)-elesclomol and platinum(II) elesclomol complexes were 34- and 1040-fold less potent than the copper(II)-elesclomol complex towards human leukemia K562 cells. These results support the conclusion that a redox active metal is required for elesclomol to exert its cell growth inhibitory activity. Copper(II)-elesclomol was also shown to efficiently oxidize ascorbic acid at physiological ascorbic acid concentrations. Reoxidation of the copper(I) thus produced would lead to production of damaging reactive oxygen species. An X-ray crystallographic structure determination of copper(II)-elesclomol showed that it formed a 1:1 neutral complex with a distorted square planar structure. The kinetics and equilibria of the competition reaction of the strong copper(II) chelator TRIEN with copper(II)-elesclomol were studied spectrophotometrically under physiological conditions. These results showed elesclomol bound copper(II) with a conditional stability constant 24-fold larger than TRIEN. A log stability constant of 24.2 was thus indirectly determined for the copper(II)-elesclomol complex.,"['Yadav, Arun A', 'Patel, Daywin', 'Wu, Xing', 'Hasinoff, Brian B']","['Yadav AA', 'Patel D', 'Wu X', 'Hasinoff BB']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Apotex Centre, 750 McDermot Avenue, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3E 0T5, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130428,United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', '6UK191M53P (elesclomol)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'SJ76Y07H5F (Trientine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/chemistry', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coordination Complexes/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Copper/*chemistry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nickel/*chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Platinum/*chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/chemistry', 'Trientine/chemistry']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0162-0134(13)00104-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2013.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 2013 Sep;126:1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2013.04.013.

This includes the thymus, intestine, skin and the brain. Recent research has also revealed that locally synthesized GCs most likely act in a paracrine or autocrine manner and have significant physiological roles in local homeostasis, cell development and immune cell activation. In this review, we summarize the nature, regulation and known physiological roles of extra-adrenal GC synthesis.

Structure confirmation of all generated compounds was accomplished by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR and MS spectroscopy methods. All the prepared compounds were analyzed using RP-TLC, and their lipophilicity (RM) was determined. The hydrophobicity (log P), solubility (logS), polar surface area (PSA) and molar volume (MV) of the studied compounds were also calculated. All the target compounds were tested for their in vitro transdermal penetration effect and as potential intestinal absorption enhancers. The cytotoxicity of all the evaluated compounds was evaluated against normal human skin fibroblast cells. Their anti-proliferative activity was also assessed against human cancer cell lines: T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line and breast adenocarcinoma cell line. One compound showed high selective cytotoxicity against human skin fibroblast cells and another compound possessed high cytotoxicity against breast adenocarcinoma cell line and skin fibroblast cells. Only one compound expressed anti-proliferative effect on leukaemia and breast adenocarcinoma cells without affecting the growth of normal cells, which should be promising in potential development of new drugs.

However, the phenotype of leukemic stem cells (LSC) is sustained by beta catenin rather than by the BCR-ABL TK. beta catenin activity in CML is contingent upon its stabilization proceeding from the BCR-ABL-induced phosphorylation at critical residues for interaction with the Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/Axin/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) destruction complex or GSK3 inactivating mutations. Here we studied the impact of beta catenin antagonist Chibby (CBY) on beta catenin signaling in BCR-ABL1+ cells. CBY is a small conserved protein which interacts with beta catenin and impairs beta catenin-mediated transcriptional activation through two distinct molecular mechanisms: 1) competition with T cell factor (TCF) or lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) for beta catenin binding; and 2) nuclear export of beta catenin via interaction with 14-3-3. We found that its enforced expression in K562 cell line promoted beta catenin cytoplasmic translocation resulting in inhibition of target gene transcription. Moreover, cytoplasmic accumulation of beta catenin activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated pathway known as unfolded protein response (UPR). CBY-driven cytoplasmic accumulation of beta catenin is also a component of BCR-ABL1+ cell response to the TK inhibitor Imatinib (IM). It evoked the UPR activation leading to the induction of BCL2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) by UPR sensors. BIM, in turn, contributed to the execution phase of apoptosis in the activation of ER resident caspase 12 and mobilization of Ca(2+) stores.","['Mancini, Manuela', 'Leo, Elisa', 'Takemaru, Ken-Ichi', 'Campi, Virginia', 'Borsi, Enrica', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Santucci, Maria Alessandra', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Mancini M', 'Leo E', 'Takemaru K', 'Campi V', 'Borsi E', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Santucci MA', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES - Institute of Hematology L and A Seragnoli, University of Bologna-Medical School, Italy. mancini_manu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['R01 HL107493/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130524,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (CBY1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', '*Unfolded Protein Response', 'beta Catenin/analysis/*metabolism']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/01/28 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(13)00144-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.05.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Sep;25(9):1820-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.05.019.

Caffeine induced an increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and ROS generation leading to p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation, respectively. Caffeine treatment elicited MKP-1 down-regulation and PP2Acalpha up-regulation. The transfection of constitutively active MEK1 or pretreatment with SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) abolished the caffeine effect on MKP-1 and PP2Acalpha expression. Caffeine repressed ERK-mediated c-Fos phosphorylation but evoked p38 MAPK-mediated CREB phosphorylation. Knockdown of c-Fos and CREB by siRNA showed that c-Fos and CREB were responsible for MKP-1 and PP2Acalpha expression, respectively. Promoter and chromatin immunoprecipitating assay supported the role of c-Fos and CREB in regulating MKP-1 and PP2Acalpha expression.

Cmi is required for the activation of ecdysone hormone targets and plays a critical role in development and tissue patterning. Using multiple approaches that include genetic interaction tests and tissue specific knockdown and overexpression of cmi, we demonstrate that Cmi has important functions in controlling wing vein patterning through regulation of the conserved Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway. The loss of function allele, cmi(1), enhances loss of dpp function phenotypes in genetic epistasis tests. Wing specific knockdown of cmi results in incomplete veins towards the distal wing margin that are enhanced by the simultaneous knockdown of dpp. In contrast, the overexpression of a tagged full-length HA-cmi transgene results in ectopic veins that are sensitive to Dpp levels. The knockdown and overexpression of cmi result in reduced and increased Dpp signaling as observed by immunostaining for phospho-MAD (Mother against DPP), a downstream effector of Dpp function. shRNAi depletion of cmi suppresses a tkv reduced function phenotype while the overexpression of HA-cmi enhances tkv RNAi phenotypes. We further show by enhancer reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation that Cmi controls wing vein patterning by regulating dpp transcription directly or indirectly through the 3' disc regulatory region at the larval stage and through the 5' shortvein (shv) regulatory region at the pupal stage. Our data reveals that Cmi is a key part of the mechanism that controls wing vein patterning through nuclear receptor regulation of the Dpp signaling pathway.","['Chauhan, Chhavi', 'Zraly, Claudia B', 'Dingwall, Andrew K']","['Chauhan C', 'Zraly CB', 'Dingwall AK']","['Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University of Chicago Maywood IL USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130522,United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Lpt protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (dpp protein, Drosophila)', '149291-21-4 (hh protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (TRR protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Body Patterning', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*physiology', 'Drosophila/*embryology', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivators/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology', 'Wings, Animal/embryology']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0012-1606(13)00263-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.05.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2013 Aug 15;380(2):185-98. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.05.018.

Its underlying cause remains undetermined. The disease may occur with increased frequency within certain families, often in association with specific genomic mutations, while some sporadic cases have been linked to environmental toxins or trauma. Another possibility, first proposed in the 1970s, is that retroviruses play a role in pathogenesis. In this paper, we review the published literature for evidence that ALS is associated either with infection by an exogenous retrovirus or with the expression of human endogenous retroviral (HERV) sequences in cells of the central nervous system. A small percentage of persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) or human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) develop ALS-like syndromes. While HTLV-1 associated ALS-like syndrome has several features that may distinguish it from classical ALS, HIV-infected patients may develop neurological manifestations that resemble classical ALS although it occurs at a younger age and they may show a dramatic improvement following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. However, most patients with probable or definite ALS show no evidence of HIV-1 or HTLV-1 infection. In contrast, recent reports have shown a stronger association with HERV, as analysis of serum samples, and postmortem brain tissue from a number of patients with a classical ALS has revealed significantly increased expression of HERV-K, compared to controls. These findings suggest that endogenous retroviral elements are involved in the pathophysiology of ALS, but there is no evidence that they are the primary cause of the syndrome.","['Alfahad, Tariq', 'Nath, Avindra']","['Alfahad T', 'Nath A']","['Section of Infections of the Nervous System, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States.']",['eng'],['ZIA NS003130-02/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130523,Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,,IM,"['Adult', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/complications/*virology', 'Central Nervous System/virology', '*Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motor Neurons/pathology/*virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3723705,['NIHMS484755'],2013/05/28 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0166-3542(13)00137-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 2013 Aug;99(2):180-7. doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.05.006.

The authors conducted a historical cohort study to examine cancer incidence among Dutch Balkan veterans. Male military personnel (n=18,175, median follow-up 11 years) of the Army and Military Police who had been deployed to the Balkan region (1993-2001) was compared with their peers not deployed to the Balkans (n=135,355, median follow-up 15 years) and with the general Dutch population of comparable age and sex. The incidence of all cancers and 4 main cancer subgroups was studied in the period 1993-2008. The cancer incidence rate among Balkan deployed military men was 17% lower than among non-Balkan deployed military men (hazard ratio 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.69, 1.00)). For the 4 main cancer subgroups, hazard ratios were statistically non-significantly below 1. Also compared to the general population cancer rates were lower in Balkan deployed personnel (standardised incidence rate ratio (SIR) 0.85 (0.73, 0.99). The SIR for leukaemia was 0.63 (0.20, 1.46). The authors conclude that earlier suggestions of increased cancer risks among veterans are not supported by empirical data. The lower risk of cancer might be explained by the 'healthy warrior effect'.","['Bogers, Rik P', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E', 'Grievink, Linda', 'Schouten, Leo J', 'Kiemeney, Lambertus A L M', 'Schram-Bijkerk, Dieneke']","['Bogers RP', 'van Leeuwen FE', 'Grievink L', 'Schouten LJ', 'Kiemeney LA', 'Schram-Bijkerk D']","['National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, PO Box 1, 3720 BA Bilthoven, The Netherlands. rik.bogers@rivm.nl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130522,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,['4OC371KSTK (Uranium)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Balkan Peninsula', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Military Personnel/*statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Registries', 'Uranium/poisoning', 'Veterans/*statistics & numerical data', '*Warfare', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(13)00065-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2013.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2013 Oct;37(5):550-5. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2013.04.005.

Whole genome microarrays and RNA-sequencing are commonly used to determine the expression levels of genes in cell lysates (a physical mix of millions of cells) for inferring gene functions. However, cellular heterogeneity becomes an inherent noise in the measurement of gene expression. The unique molecular characteristics of individual cells, as well as the temporal and quantitative information of gene expression in cells, are lost when averaged among all cells in cell lysates. Our single-cell technology overcomes this limitation and enables us to obtain a large number of single-cell transcriptomes from a population of cells. A collection of single-cell molecular profiles allows us to study carcinogenesis from an evolutionary perspective by treating cancer as a diverse population of cells with abnormal molecular characteristics. Because a cancer cell population contains cells at various stages of development toward drug resistance, clustering similar single-cell molecular profiles could reveal how drug-resistant sub-clones evolve during cancer treatment. Here, we discuss how single-cell transcriptome analysis technology could enable the study of carcinogenesis from an evolutionary perspective and the development of drug-resistance in leukemia. The single-cell transcriptome analysis reported here could have a direct and significant impact on current cancer treatments and future personalized cancer therapies.","['Zhang, Xi', 'Zhang, Cheng', 'Li, Zhongjun', 'Zhong, Jiangjian', 'Weiner, Leslie P', 'Zhong, Jiang F']","['Zhang X', 'Zhang C', 'Li Z', 'Zhong J', 'Weiner LP', 'Zhong JF']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA; 2Z-Genetic Medicine LLC, Temple City, CA 91780, USA. jzhong@usc.edu.']",['eng'],"['R21 CA134391/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA164509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA134391/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA164509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000130/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130527,England,Chin J Cancer,Chinese journal of cancer,101498232,,IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', '*Transcriptome']",PMC3870846,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cjc.012.10291 [pii]', '10.5732/cjc.012.10291 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer. 2013 Dec;32(12):636-9. doi: 10.5732/cjc.012.10291.

Small molecule S1 is a BH3 mimetic discovered by our previous studies. The aim of this study is to dissect the details of apoptosis signaling induced by S1 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells and to provide a molecular basis for the use of S1 in AML treatment. The anti-leukemic activity of S1 was evaluated in three cultured AML cell lines and eight patient samples. S1 induced apoptosis via an intrinsic apoptosis pathway by the disruption of protein-protein interactions of Bcl-2 family members and triggered the activation of Bax and Bak in AML cells. For the first time, we report that S1 can release pro-apoptotic protein from Bcl-XL and selectively inhibits colony formation of primary AML cells. Bak activation and release determined S1 sensitivity in AML cells. Furthermore, S1-induced apoptosis was largely reduced in cells with shRNA-mediated downregulation of Bak but not Bax. The combination of S1 with PD98059 can inhibit Bcl-2 phosphorylation and enhance Bak release from Bcl-2. Our study identified Bak as a key mediator of S1-induced intrinsic apoptosis in AML cells. Moreover, our data suggest that Bcl-2 phosphorylation plays an anti-apoptotic role in S1-induced apoptosis. This study could contribute not only to the future clinical development of S1, but also the rational use of other pan-Bcl-2 inhibitors, alone or in combination with kinase inhibitor-based strategies.","['Liu, Yubo', 'Li, Zhiqiang', 'Song, Ting', 'Xue, Zuguang', 'Zhang, Zhichao']","['Liu Y', 'Li Z', 'Song T', 'Xue Z', 'Zhang Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China; School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130503,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Molecular Mimicry', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/05/23 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(13)00064-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2013.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2013 Sep;67(7):583-91. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2013.04.010.

Treatment-related cardiac damage is progressive and often difficult to reverse. Strategies to minimize cardiotoxicity during treatment are crucial to prevent severe lasting effects on health and quality of life. AREAS COVERED: This comprehensive review covers the pathophysiology and various presentations, both clinical and subclinical, of treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and characteristics associated with increased risk of cardiac dysfunction in childhood ALL survivors. Additionally, contemporary prevention strategies such as limiting cumulative anthracycline dose, altering drug administration schedule, the use of anthracycline structural analogs, liposomal encapsulated anthracyclines, cardioprotective agents and nutritional supplements are critically analyzed. Finally, this review covers the management options of chemotherapy-induced damage and other treatment-related cardiotoxicity. EXPERT OPINION: Higher lifetime cumulative doses of anthracyclines, younger age at diagnosis, longer follow-up, female sex, higher dose rates and cranial irradiation are associated with more severe cardiotoxic effects. Long-term adverse effects of both anthracycline and non-anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents are becoming an increasing focus during treatment of childhood malignancies. There must be a careful balance between achieving remission of childhood ALL while avoiding the development of another often-fatal illness, heart failure.","['Zerra, Patricia', 'Cochran, Thomas R', 'Franco, Vivian I', 'Lipshultz, Steven E']","['Zerra P', 'Cochran TR', 'Franco VI', 'Lipshultz SE']","['University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics (D820), P.O.

Bcl-2 family proteins delicately regulate mitochondrial outer membrane integrity through protein-protein interactions, which makes the mitochondrion an ideal cell-free system for screening molecules targeting the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins. But assay conditions need to be optimized for more reliable results. In this study, we aimed at establishing a reliable functional assay using mitochondria isolated from breast cancer cells to decipher the mode of action of BH3 peptides derived from BH3-only proteins. In this study, high ionic strength buffer was adopted during the initiation of MOMP. Mitochondria isolated from human breast cancer cell lines with distinct expression patterns of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins were permeabilized by different BH3 peptides alone or in combination, with or without the presence of recombinant anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Cytochrome C and Smac/Diablo were tested in both supernatants and mitochondrial pellets by Western blotting. RESULTS: Sufficient ionic strength was required for optimal release of Cytochrome C. Bad and Noxa BH3 peptides exhibited their bona fide antagonistic effects against Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 proteins, respectively, whereas Bim BH3 peptide antagonized all three anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members. Bad and Noxa peptides synergized with each other in the induction of MOMP when mitochondria were dually protected by both Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. CONCLUSIONS: This method based on MOMP is a useful screening tool for identifying BH3 mimetics with selective toxicity against breast cancer cell mitochondria protected by the three major Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins.","['Long, Jianting', 'Liu, Liu', 'Nikolovska-Coleska, Zaneta', 'Shangary, Sanjeev', 'Yi, Han', 'Wang, Shenming', 'Wang, Shaomeng']","['Long J', 'Liu L', 'Nikolovska-Coleska Z', 'Shangary S', 'Yi H', 'Wang S', 'Wang S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130524,England,BMC Biotechnol,BMC biotechnology,101088663,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC3717276,,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/05/20 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6750-13-45 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6750-13-45 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biotechnol. 2013 May 24;13:45. doi: 10.1186/1472-6750-13-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute leukemia, the AKT pathway is frequently activated, however mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway are uncommon. In some cases, constitutive AKT activation can be linked to gain-of-function tyrosine kinase (TK) mutations upstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway are attractive candidates for cancer drug development, but so far clinical efficacy of PI3K inhibitors against various neoplasms has been moderate. Furthermore, specific MTORC1 inhibitors, acting downstream of AKT, have the disadvantage of activating AKT via feed-back mechanisms. We now evaluated the antitumor efficacy of NVP-BGT226, a novel dual pan-PI3K and MTORC1/2 inhibitor, in acute leukemia. METHODS: Native leukemia blasts were stained to analyze for AKT phosphorylation levels on a flow cytometer. Efficacy of NVP-BGT226 in comparison to a second dual inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235, was determined with regard to cellular proliferation, autophagy, cell cycle regulation and induction of apoptosis in in vitro and ex vivo cellular assays as well as on the protein level. An isogenic AKT-autoactivated Ba/F3 model, different human leukemia cell lines as well as native leukemia patient blasts were studied. Isobologram analyses were set up to calculate for (super) additive or antagonistic effects of two agents. RESULTS: We show, that phosphorylation of AKT is frequently augmented in acute leukemia. NVP-BGT226 as well as NVP-BEZ235 profoundly and globally suppress AKT signaling pathways, which translates into potent antiproliferative effects. Furthermore, NVP-BGT226 has potent proapoptotic effects in vitro as well as in ex vivo native blasts. Surprisingly and in contrast, NVP-BEZ235 leads to a profound G1/G0 arrest preventing significant induction of apoptosis. Combination with TK inhibitors, which are currently been tested in the treatment of acute leukemia subtypes, overcomes cell cycle arrest and results in (super)additive proapoptotic effects for NVP-BGT226--but also for NVP-BEZ235. Importantly, mononuclear donor cells show lower phospho-AKT expression levels and consequently, relative insensitivity towards dual PI3K-MTORC1/2 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a favorable antileukemic profile for NVP-BGT226 compared to NVP-BEZ235--which provides a strong rationale for clinical evaluation of the dual PI3K-MTORC1/2 inhibitor NVP-BGT226 in acute leukemia.","['Kampa-Schittenhelm, Kerstin Maria', 'Heinrich, Michael Charles', 'Akmut, Figen', 'Rasp, Katharina Henriette', 'Illing, Barbara', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Schittenhelm, Marcus Matthias']","['Kampa-Schittenhelm KM', 'Heinrich MC', 'Akmut F', 'Rasp KH', 'Illing B', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K', 'Schittenhelm MM']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, Immunology and Pulmology, University Hospital Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Strasse 10, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130524,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0', '(8-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-(4-piperazin-1-yl-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-', '1,3-dihydroimidazo(4,5-c)quinolin-2-one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mutation', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/deficiency/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC3689638,,2013/05/28 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2012/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-46 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-46 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 May 24;12:46. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very few provocation studies have examined the health effects of ELF magnetic fields on teenagers. METHODS: In this double-blind study, we simultaneously investigated physiological changes (heart rate, respiration rate, and heart rate variability), subjective symptoms, and magnetic field perception to determine the reliable effects of 60 Hz 12.5 muT magnetic fields on teenagers. Two volunteer groups of 30 adults and 30 teenagers were tested with exposure to sham and real magnetic fields for 32 min. RESULTS: ELF magnetic field exposure did not have any effects on the physiological parameters or eight subjective symptoms in either group. Neither group correctly perceived the magnetic fields. CONCLUSIONS: Physiological data were analysed, subjective symptoms surveyed, and the percentages of those who believed they were being exposed were measured.

As deeper data is obtained, the existence of higher complexity SVs in some genomes becomes more evident, but the detection and definition of most of these complex rearrangements is still in its infancy. The full characterization of SVs is a key aspect for discovering their biological implications. Here we present a pipeline (PeSV-Fisher) for the detection of deletions, gains, intra- and inter-chromosomal translocations, and inversions, at very reasonable computational costs. We further provide comprehensive information on co-localization of SVs in the genome, a crucial aspect for studying their biological consequences. The algorithm uses a combination of methods based on paired-reads and read-depth strategies. PeSV-Fisher has been designed with the aim to facilitate identification of somatic variation, and, as such, it is capable of analysing two or more samples simultaneously, producing a list of non-shared variants between samples. We tested PeSV-Fisher on available sequencing data, and compared its behaviour to that of frequently deployed tools (BreakDancer and VariationHunter).

However, the clinical translation of CUR has been significantly hampered due to its extensive degradation, suboptimal pharmacokinetics, and poor bioavailability. To address these clinically relevant issues, we have developed a novel CUR-loaded magnetic nanoparticle (MNP-CUR) formulation. Herein, we have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of this novel MNP-CUR formulation in pancreatic cancer. Human pancreatic cancer cells (HPAF-II and Panc-1) exhibited efficient internalization of the MNP-CUR formulation in a dose-dependent manner. As a result, the MNP-CUR formulation effectively inhibited growth of HPAF-II and Panc-1 cells in cell proliferation and colony formation assays. The MNP-CUR formulation suppressed pancreatic tumor growth in an HPAF-II xenograft mouse model and improved the survival of mice by delaying tumor growth. The growth-inhibitory effect of MNP-CUR formulation correlated with the suppression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1), cell surface-associated Mucin 1 (MUC1), collagen I, and enhanced membrane beta-catenin expression. MNP-CUR formulation did not show any sign of hemotoxicity and was stable after incubation with human serum proteins. In addition, the MNP-CUR formulation improved serum bioavailability of CUR in mice up to 2.5-fold as compared with free CUR. Biodistribution studies show that a significant amount of MNP-CUR formulation was able to reach the pancreatic xenograft tumor(s), which suggests its clinical translational potential. In conclusion, this study suggests that our novel MNP-CUR formulation can be valuable for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","['Yallapu, Murali M', 'Ebeling, Mara C', 'Khan, Sheema', 'Sundram, Vasudha', 'Chauhan, Neeraj', 'Gupta, Brij K', 'Puumala, Susan E', 'Jaggi, Meena', 'Chauhan, Subhash C']","['Yallapu MM', 'Ebeling MC', 'Khan S', 'Sundram V', 'Chauhan N', 'Gupta BK', 'Puumala SE', 'Jaggi M', 'Chauhan SC']","['Cancer Biology Research Center, Sanford Research/University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, SD, USA.']",['eng'],"['P20 GM103548/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA162106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103548-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130523,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Availability', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Magnetite Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3965353,['NIHMS485724'],2013/05/25 06:00,2014/04/02 06:00,['2013/05/25 06:00'],"['2013/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-1227 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1227 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 Aug;12(8):1471-80. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1227.

To elucidate the mechanism by which RUNX1 disruption initiates leukemogenesis, we investigated its normal role in murine B-cell development. This study revealed 2 critical functions of Runx1: (1) to promote survival and development of progenitors specified to the B-cell lineage, a function that can be substituted by ectopic Bcl2 expression, and (2) to enable the developmental transition through the pre-B stage triggered by the pre-B-cell antigen receptor (pre-BCR). Gene expression analysis and genomewide Runx1 occupancy studies support the hypothesis that Runx1 reinforces the transcription factor network governing early B-cell survival and development and specifically regulates genes encoding members of the Lyn kinase subfamily (key integrators of interleukin-7 and pre-BCR signaling) and the stage-specific transcription factors SpiB and Aiolos (critical downstream effectors of pre-BCR signaling). Interrogation of expression databases of 257 ALL samples demonstrated the specific down-regulation of the SPIB and IKZF3 genes (the latter encoding AIOLOS) in t(12;21) ALL, providing novel insight into the mechanism by which the translocation blocks B-cell development and promotes leukemia.","['Niebuhr, Birte', 'Kriebitzsch, Neele', 'Fischer, Meike', 'Behrens, Kira', 'Gunther, Thomas', 'Alawi, Malik', 'Bergholz, Ulla', 'Muller, Ursula', 'Roscher, Susanne', 'Ziegler, Marion', 'Buchholz, Frank', 'Grundhoff, Adam', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Niebuhr B', 'Kriebitzsch N', 'Fischer M', 'Behrens K', 'Gunther T', 'Alawi M', 'Bergholz U', 'Muller U', 'Roscher S', 'Ziegler M', 'Buchholz F', 'Grundhoff A', 'Stocking C']","['Molecular Pathology, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Martinistrasse 52, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130523,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Ikzf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genome/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2013/05/25 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/05/25 06:00'],"['2013/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56071-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-480244 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jul 18;122(3):413-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-480244.

We conducted a prospective clinical trial of imatinib withdrawal in 40 chronic-phase CML patients who had sustained undetectable minimal residual disease (UMRD) by conventional quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on imatinib for at least 2 years. Patients stopped imatinib and were monitored frequently for molecular relapse. At 24 months, the actuarial estimate of stable treatment-free remission was 47.1%. Most relapses occurred within 4 months of stopping imatinib, and no relapses beyond 27 months were seen. In the 21 patients treated with interferon before imatinib, a shorter duration of interferon treatment before imatinib was significantly associated with relapse risk, as was slower achievement of UMRD after switching to imatinib. Highly sensitive patient-specific BCR-ABL DNA PCR showed persistence of the original CML clone in all patients with stable UMRD, even several years after imatinib withdrawal. No patients with molecular relapse after discontinuation have progressed or developed BCR-ABL mutations (median follow-up, 42 months).

We investigated how these alterations cause distinct clinical phenotypes by combining structural, biochemical, and genomic approaches with gene complementation systems that examine GATA1 function in biologically relevant cellular contexts. Substitutions that disrupt FOG1 cofactor binding impair both gene activation and repression and are associated with pronounced clinical phenotypes. Moreover, clinical severity correlates with the degree of FOG1 disruption. Surprisingly, 2 mutations shown to impair DNA binding of GATA1 in vitro did not measurably affect in vivo target gene occupancy. Rather, one of these disrupted binding to the TAL1 complex, implicating it in diseases caused by GATA1 mutations. Diminished TAL1 complex recruitment mainly impairs transcriptional activation and is linked to relatively mild disease. Notably, different substitutions at the same amino acid can selectively inhibit TAL1 complex or FOG1 binding, producing distinct cellular and clinical phenotypes. The structure-function relationships elucidated here were not predicted by prior in vitro or computational studies.

To address the role of clonal evolution in relapsed NPM1-mutated (NPM1mut) AML, we applied high-resolution, genome-wide, single-nucleotide polymorphism array profiling to detect copy number alterations (CNAs) and uniparental disomies (UPDs) and performed comprehensive gene mutation screening in 53 paired bone marrow/peripheral blood samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse. At diagnosis, 15 aberrations (CNAs, n = 10; UPDs, n = 5) were identified in 13 patients (25%), whereas at relapse, 56 genomic alterations (CNAs, n = 46; UPDs, n = 10) were detected in 29 patients (55%) indicating an increase in genomic complexity. Recurrent aberrations acquired at relapse included deletions affecting tumor suppressor genes (ETV6 [n = 3], TP53 [n = 2], NF1 [n = 2], WT1 [n = 3], FHIT [n = 2]) and homozygous FLT3 mutations acquired via UPD13q (n = 7). DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3Amut) showed the highest stability (97%). Persistence of DNMT3Amut in 5 patients who lost NPM1mut at relapse suggests that DNMT3Amut may precede NPM1mut in AML pathogenesis. Of note, all relapse samples shared at least 1 genetic aberration with the matched primary AML sample, implying common ancestral clones. In conclusion, our study reveals novel insights into clonal evolution in NPM1mut AML.","['Kronke, Jan', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Teleanu, Veronica', 'Tschurtz, Florian', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Kuhn, Michael W M', 'Rucker, Frank G', 'Holzmann, Karlheinz', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Kapp-Schworer, Silke', 'Spath, Daniela', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Schittenhelm, Marcus', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Kronke J', 'Bullinger L', 'Teleanu V', 'Tschurtz F', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Kuhn MW', 'Rucker FG', 'Holzmann K', 'Paschka P', 'Kapp-Schworer S', 'Spath D', 'Kindler T', 'Schittenhelm M', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Genomics Core Facility, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130523,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/25 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/05/25 06:00'],"['2013/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57208-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-479188 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jul 4;122(1):100-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-479188.

To further intensify anthracycline dosage without increasing cardiotoxicity, we compared potentially less cardiotoxic liposomal daunorubicin (L-DNR) to idarubicin at a higher-than-equivalent dose (80 vs 12 mg/m(2) per day for 3 days) during induction. In the multicenter therapy-optimization trial AML-BFM 2004, 521 of 611 pediatric patients (85%) were randomly assigned to L-DNR or idarubicin induction. Five-year results in both treatment arms were similar (overall survival 76% +/- 3% [L-DNR] vs 75% +/- 3% [idarubicin], Plogrank = .65; event-free survival [EFS] 59% +/- 3% vs 53% +/- 3%, Plogrank = .25; cumulative incidence of relapse 29% +/- 3% vs 31% +/- 3%, P(Gray) = .75), as were EFS results for standard (72% +/- 5% vs 68% +/- 5%, Plogrank = .47) and high-risk (51% +/- 4% vs 46% +/- 4%, Plogrank = .45) patients. L-DNR resulted in significantly better probability of EFS in patients with t(8;21). Overall, treatment-related mortality was lower with L-DNR than idarubicin (2/257 vs 10/264 patients, P = .04). Grade 3/4 cardiotoxicity was rare after induction (4 L-DNR vs 5 idarubicin). Only 1 L-DNR and 3 idarubicin patients presented with subclinical or mild cardiomyopathy during follow-up. In conclusion, at the given dose, L-DNR has overall antileukemic activity comparable to idarubicin, promises to be more active in subgroups, and causes less treatment-related mortality.

Mathematical models provide a useful tool to evaluate this complex system and to elucidate hypotheses that would be otherwise untenable to test in vitro or in vivo. Forty years of model development and refinement along with enhancements in technology have led to systematic improvement in our biological understanding of these models. However, increased complexity does not always lead to increased understanding, and a balanced approach to modeling the system is often advantageous. This approach should address questions about sensitivity of the model to variation and incorporate genomic data. The folate model is a useful platform for investigating the effects of antifolates on the folate pathway. The utility of the model is demonstrated through interrogation of drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, drug selectivity, and drug doses and schedules.

Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is an important survival pathway in CCA. Herein, we further examine the mechanisms whereby Hh signaling mediates apoptosis resistance in CCA, revealing a pivotal role for the cell division regulating serine/threonine kinase polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2). We employed 50 human CCA samples (25 intrahepatic and 25 extrahepatic CCA) as well as human KMCH-1, Mz-CHA-1, and HUCCT-1 CCA cells for these studies. In vivo experiments were conducted using a syngeneic rat orthotopic CCA model. In human samples, polo-like kinase (PLK)1/2/3-immunoreactive cancer cells were present in the preponderance of intra- and extrahepatic CCA specimens. Inhibition of Hh signaling by cyclopamine reduced PLK2, but not PLK1 or PLK3, messenger RNA and protein expression in vehicle-treated and sonic Hh-treated CCA cells, confirming our previous microarray study. PLK2 regulation by Hh signaling appears to be direct, because the Hh transcription factors, glioma-associated oncogene 1 and 2, bind to the PLK2 promotor. Moreover, inhibition of PLK2 by the PLK inhibitor, BI 6727 (volasertib), or PLK2 knockdown was proapoptotic in CCA cells. BI 6727 administration or PLK2 knockdown decreased cellular protein levels of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), an effect reversed by the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132. Finally, BI 6727 administration reduced Mcl-1 protein expression in CCA cells, resulting in CCA cell apoptosis and tumor suppression in vivo. CONCLUSION: PLK2 appears to be an important mediator of Hh survival signaling.

We studied the clinicopathologic features of de novo T-ALL/LBL patients treated at our institution during 2003-2011, with an emphasis on immunophenotype and survival of TdT-negative versus TdT-positive cases. Absence of TdT expression was defined as <10% lymphoblasts positive. Seven (12%) TdT-negative cases were identified from a cohort of 59 de novo T-ALL/LBL. The TdT-negative and TdT-positive cases were similar with regard to gender, percentage of patients with a high leukocyte count (>100 x 10(9)/l), central nervous system involvement, and an abnormal karyotype. However, patients with TdT-negative T-ALL/LBL had a significantly higher rate of disease progression and shorter overall survival. Although not statistically significant, TdT-negative T-ALL/LBL cases were associated with an older median age and higher percentage of 'early T precursor' (ETP) immunophenotype than TdT-positive cases.

It is clear that the prognosis of individual patients is strongly influenced by the combination of mutations in their leukaemia and that many leukaemias are composed of multiple subclones, with differential susceptibilities to treatment. Here, we describe a method, employing targeted capture coupled with next-generation sequencing and tailored bioinformatic analysis, for the simultaneous study of 24 genes recurrently mutated in AML-NK. Mutational analysis was performed using open source software and an in-house script (Mutation Identification and Analysis Software), which identified dominant clone mutations with 100% specificity. In each of seven cases of AML-NK studied, we identified and verified mutations in 2-4 genes in the main leukaemic clone. Additionally, high sequencing depth enabled us to identify putative subclonal mutations and detect leukaemia-specific mutations in DNA from remission marrow. Finally, we used normalised read depths to detect copy number changes and identified and subsequently verified a tandem duplication of exons 2-9 of MLL and at least one deletion involving PTEN. This methodology reliably detects sequence and copy number mutations, and can thus greatly facilitate the classification, clinical research, diagnosis and management of AML-NK.","['Conte, N', 'Varela, I', 'Grove, C', 'Manes, N', 'Yusa, K', 'Moreno, T', 'Segonds-Pichon, A', 'Bench, A', 'Gudgin, E', 'Herman, B', 'Bolli, N', 'Ellis, P', 'Haddad, D', 'Costeas, P', 'Rad, R', 'Scott, M', 'Huntly, B', 'Bradley, A', 'Vassiliou, G S']","['Conte N', 'Varela I', 'Grove C', 'Manes N', 'Yusa K', 'Moreno T', 'Segonds-Pichon A', 'Bench A', 'Gudgin E', 'Herman B', 'Bolli N', 'Ellis P', 'Haddad D', 'Costeas P', 'Rad R', 'Scott M', 'Huntly B', 'Bradley A', 'Vassiliou GS']","['Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['079249/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '095663/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '100140/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130418,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences']",PMC3768109,,2013/05/25 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013117 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Sep;27(9):1820-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.117.

In this study, LukS-PV had the ability to induce apoptosis in the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line THP-1. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of LukS-PV-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells treated with LukS-PV, resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induced G0/G1 arrest associated with an inhibition of cell cycle arrest regulatory protein (cyclin D1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as measured by flow cytometry (FCM). After 12h exposure to LukS-PV (1.00 muM), annexin V-EGFP/propidium iodide (PI) FCM revealed that 19.5+/-3.6% of THP-1 cells were apoptotic, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining also revealed THP-1 cells were apoptotic. Chip analysis of 84 apoptosis-related genes demonstrated that 9 genes were up-regulated at least 2-fold and that 5 genes were down-regulated at least 2-fold in the treatment group when compared with levels in the control group. Western blotting reveled that the expression of caspase-8 increased significantly (approximately 4-fold). The levels of caspase-9, -3 and Bax increased significantly, and levels of Bcl-2 decreased rapidly with LukS-PV treatment. These data suggest that LukS-PV acts as an anti-leukemia agent and activates AML cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, LukS-PV may be a multi-targeting drug candidate for the prevention and therapy of AML.","['Bu, Su', 'Xie, Qiang', 'Chang, Wenjiao', 'Huo, Xingxing', 'Chen, Feihu', 'Ma, Xiaoling']","['Bu S', 'Xie Q', 'Chang W', 'Huo X', 'Chen F', 'Ma X']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230001, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Leukocidins)', '0 (Panton-Valentine leukocidin)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Bacterial Toxins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Exotoxins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocidins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics']",,,2013/05/25 06:00,2014/02/12 06:00,['2013/05/25 06:00'],"['2013/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(13)00148-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2013.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2013 Aug;45(8):1531-7. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2013.05.011.

Recent studies have shown that the absence of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation confers a favorable prognosis in NPM1-positive AML. However, the prognostic impact of immunophenotypes in this subgroup remains unclear. In this study, FLT3 mutation status and immunophenotypic profile of 85 NPM1-positive patients with de novo AML were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with their clinical features and survival outcomes. Univariate analysis detected 5 markers with prognostic relevance: older age (>/=60 years), high white blood cell (WBC) count (>30 x 10(9)/L), FLT3-ITD, CD7, and CD34 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that high WBC count was the only independent predictor of a lower complete remission rate (P = .019). Older age (P = .035), high WBC count (P = .008), FLT3-ITD (P = .012), and CD34 expression (P = .006) were independent predictors of a shorter event-free survival (EFS). High WBC count (P = .014), FLT3-ITD (P = .005), and CD34 expression (P = .047) were independent predictors of a shorter overall survival (OS). Furthermore, based on FLT3-ITD status in NPM1 mutation-positive patients, we showed that both high WBC and CD34 expression conferred a poor EFS (P = .010 and P = .016, respectively) and OS (P = .032 and P = .001, respectively) in the FLT3-ITD-negative group, whereas high WBC predicted a poor EFS (P = .016) and OS (P = .027) in the FLT3-ITD-positive group. Our results confirm the prognostic value of assessing FLT3-ITD mutations in NPM1-positive AML and identify the adverse prognostic impact of high WBC and CD34 expression in this subgroup of AML.","['Dang, Harry', 'Chen, Yan', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Chang, Hong']","['Dang H', 'Chen Y', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Brandwein J', 'Chang H']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2C4; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A1.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130521,United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/05/25 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(13)00119-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2013.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2013 Oct;44(10):2038-46. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2013.03.007.

In vitro, both N- and K-FGM were able to induce T regulatory cells in terms of Foxp-3 molecule expression and release of interleukin-10. In another set of experiments both N- and K-FGM were able to balance rate of proliferation/apoptosis/necrosis of normal human peripheral lymphocytes, thus indicating the property of these compounds to maintain immune homeostatic mechanisms in the host. On the other hand, N- and K-FGM inhibited human basophil degranulation, thus, confirming our previous results obtained with rat basophilic leukemia cells. Finally, N- and K-FGM also decreased oxidative burst of human polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes.Taken together, these findings imply the potential clinical usefulness of FGM administration in inflammatory/allergic conditions, such as chronic asthma.","['Marzulli, Giuseppe', 'Magrone, Thea', 'Vonghia, Luisa', 'Kaneko, Masahiro', 'Takimoto, Hiroaki', 'Kumazawa, Yoshio', 'Jirillo, Emilio']","['Marzulli G', 'Magrone T', 'Vonghia L', 'Kaneko M', 'Takimoto H', 'Kumazawa Y', 'Jirillo E']","['Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sensory Organs, University of Bari, Bari, Italy, Piazza G.

The present study aimed to evaluate the nutritional status and dietary intake among children with acute leukaemia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 53 paediatric patients aged 3-12 years old, who were diagnosed with either acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute myelogenous leukaemia and were undergoing chemotherapy treatments (induction or consolidation phase). Patients were matched for sex, age (+/-6 months) and ethnicity with healthy children as controls. Weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference, mid-upper arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, mid-upper arm muscle area and fat area were determined. Dietary intake was assessed using 3-day food records. RESULTS: Anthropometric variables were generally higher among patients compared to controls, although the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The prevalence of overnutrition among patients according to body mass index-for-age, waist circumference-for-age, mid-upper arm circumference-for-age and triceps skinfold-for-age were 24.5%, 29.1%, 17.0% and 30.2%, respectively. Mean energy [5732 +/- 1958 kJ (1370 +/- 468 kcal) versus 6945 +/- 1970 kJ (1660 +/- 471 kcal), P < 0.01], protein (50.0 +/- 19.7 g versus 62.3 +/- 22.3 g, P < 0.01) and fat (43.6 +/- 18.9 g versus 58.3 +/- 16.7, P < 0.001) intakes of patients were significantly lower than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of being overweight and obesity in children with acute leukaemia was higher despite lower energy intake compared to controls. Studies assessing physical activity, the complex interaction and the effects of treatment drugs are warranted to better manage malnutrition among paediatric patients.","['Tan, S Y', 'Poh, B K', 'Nadrah, M H', 'Jannah, N A', 'Rahman, J', 'Ismail, M N']","['Tan SY', 'Poh BK', 'Nadrah MH', 'Jannah NA', 'Rahman J', 'Ismail MN']","['Nutritional Sciences Programme, School of Healthcare Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130524,England,J Hum Nutr Diet,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,8904840,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Dietary Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adiposity', 'Anthropometry', 'Arm', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Diet', 'Dietary Fats/administration & dosage', 'Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage', '*Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Nutrition Assessment', '*Nutritional Status', 'Obesity/*complications/epidemiology', 'Overnutrition', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Skinfold Thickness', 'Waist Circumference']",,,2013/05/25 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/05/25 06:00'],"['2013/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jhn.12074 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hum Nutr Diet. 2013 Jul;26 Suppl 1:23-33. doi: 10.1111/jhn.12074.

Here, we investigated the ability of concentrated supernatants from Lactobacillus plantarum to promote cell death in a human promyelocytic cell line. METHODS AND RESULTS: We aim to test the hypothesis that concentrated supernatants from Lact. plantarum at 5, 50 or 100 mug/ml for 24 h exert cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was diminished and nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) determined a necrotic induction in a concentrationdependent sequence. Concentrated supernatants did not modify or reduced the activity of caspase-3. The assessment of phosphatidylserine externalization by annexin V/PI double staining led to a necrotic state, but the treatment did not produce a dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), whereas cell cycle analysis revealed that concentrated supernatants failed to significantly enhance the population of HL-60 cells in the hypodiploid (sub-G1) fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Concentrated supernatants from Lact. plantarum are capable of inducing necrosis rather than apoptosis at high doses in a promyelocytic cell line.

Overexpression of Bmi-1 has been reported in various human cancers and proved to be associated with poor survival. DISSUCION: Bmi-I is expressed by various tumors and therefore may contribute to malignant transformation. Bmi-I not only can lead mammary epithelial cells to senescence and immortalization, but also plays a key role in breast cancer. A significant correlation was observed between Bmi-1 expression and axillary lymph node metastases in lymph-ductal breast cancer. Bmi-1 is expressed in cervical cancer and correlated with a poorer prognosis, suggesting that this protein participates in the development and progress of cervical cancer. Regarding ovarian cancer, the results of several immunohistochemical studies revealed overexpression of Bmi-1, especially in poorly differentiated ovarian carcinoma. There is a strong correlation between histological grade, clinical stage and its expression. CONCLUSIONS: Human genes of polycomb group correlated with various hematological and epithelial cancers identify new mechanisms of malignant transformation and pave the way for developing new cancer treatments and identify new diagnostic markers. Bmi-1 and its expression in tissues taken from patients with cervical, breast and ovarian cancer could be a marker for diagnosis and prognosis, and not least a potential target of antitumor therapy.","['Gavrilescu, Mihaela-Madalina', 'Todosi, Ana-Maria', 'Anitei, Maria-Gabriela', 'Filip, B', 'Scripcariu, V']","['Gavrilescu MM', 'Todosi AM', 'Anitei MG', 'Filip B', 'Scripcariu V']","['University of Medicine and Pharmacy Grigore T Popa Iasi, Faculty of Medicine.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Romania,Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi,Revista medico-chirurgicala a Societatii de Medici si Naturalisti din Iasi,0413735,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2013/05/25 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2013/05/25 06:00'],"['2013/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi. 2012 Oct-Dec;116(4):1112-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in airway remodelling. In this study, we hypothesized that infiltrating eosinophils promote airway remodelling in bronchial asthma. To demonstrate this hypothesis we evaluated the effect of eosinophils on EMT by in vitro and in vivo studies. EMT was assessed in mice that received intra-tracheal instillation of mouse bone marrow derived eosinophils and in human bronchial epithelial cells co-cultured with eosinophils freshly purified from healthy individuals or with eosinophilic leukemia cell lines. Intra-tracheal instillation of eosinophils was associated with enhanced bronchial inflammation and fibrosis and increased lung concentration of growth factors. Mice instilled with eosinophils pre-treated with transforming growth factor(TGF)-beta1 siRNA had decreased bronchial wall fibrosis compared to controls. EMT was induced in bronchial epithelial cells co-cultured with human eosinophils and it was associated with increased expression of TGF-beta1 and Smad3 phosphorylation in the bronchial epithelial cells. Treatment with anti-TGF-beta1 antibody blocked EMT in bronchial epithelial cells. Eosinophils induced EMT in bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting their contribution to the pathogenesis of airway remodelling.","['Yasukawa, Atsushi', 'Hosoki, Koa', 'Toda, Masaaki', 'Miyake, Yasushi', 'Matsushima, Yuki', 'Matsumoto, Takahiro', 'Boveda-Ruiz, Daniel', 'Gil-Bernabe, Paloma', 'Nagao, Mizuho', 'Sugimoto, Mayumi', 'Hiraguchi, Yukiko', 'Tokuda, Reiko', 'Naito, Masahiro', 'Takagi, Takehiro', ""D'Alessandro-Gabazza, Corina N"", 'Suga, Shigeru', 'Kobayashi, Tetsu', 'Fujisawa, Takao', 'Taguchi, Osamu', 'Gabazza, Esteban C']","['Yasukawa A', 'Hosoki K', 'Toda M', 'Miyake Y', 'Matsushima Y', 'Matsumoto T', 'Boveda-Ruiz D', 'Gil-Bernabe P', 'Nagao M', 'Sugimoto M', 'Hiraguchi Y', 'Tokuda R', 'Naito M', 'Takagi T', ""D'Alessandro-Gabazza CN"", 'Suga S', 'Kobayashi T', 'Fujisawa T', 'Taguchi O', 'Gabazza EC']","['Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130521,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchi/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism']",PMC3660301,,2013/05/24 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0064281 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-35058 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 21;8(5):e64281. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064281.

The neurotropism of HSV enables delivery of therapeutic genes to the nervous system. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), we constructed an HSV-1(17(+))-based replicative vector deleted of the neurovirulence gene gamma134.5, and expressing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a transgene for treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE is an inducible T-cell mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is used as an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Demyelination and inflammation are hallmarks of both diseases. LIF is a cytokine that has the potential to limit demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss in CNS autoimmune diseases and to affect the T-cell mediated autoimmune response. In this study SJL/J mice, induced for EAE, were treated with a HSV-LIF vector intracranially and the subsequent changes in disease parameters and immune responses during the acute disease were investigated. Replicating HSV-LIF and its DNA were detected in the CNS during the acute infection, and the vector spread to the spinal cord but was non-virulent. The HSV-LIF significantly ameliorated the EAE and contributed to a higher number of oligodendrocytes in the brains when compared to untreated mice. The HSV-LIF therapy also induced favorable changes in the expression of immunoregulatory cytokines and T-cell population markers in the CNS during the acute disease. These data suggest that BAC-derived HSV vectors are suitable for gene therapy of CNS disease and can be used to test the therapeutic potential of immunomodulatory factors for treatment of EAE.","['Nygardas, Michaela', 'Paavilainen, Henrik', 'Muther, Nadine', 'Nagel, Claus-Henning', 'Roytta, Matias', 'Sodeik, Beate', 'Hukkanen, Veijo']","['Nygardas M', 'Paavilainen H', 'Muther N', 'Nagel CH', 'Roytta M', 'Sodeik B', 'Hukkanen V']","['Department of Virology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. michaela.nygardas@utu.fi']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmunity', 'Brain/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunologic Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunomodulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myelin Sheath/pathology', 'Oligodendroglia/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Spinal Cord/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Vero Cells', 'Virus Replication']",PMC3659099,,2013/05/24 06:00,2013/12/25 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0064200 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-37525 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 20;8(5):e64200. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064200.

Vatalanib (PTK787/ZK222584; Novartis and Schering AG) inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases of vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet derived growth factor and c-Kit. We examined whether vatalanib induces hematological responses in MDS and/or delays progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or death. METHODS: Two cohorts were studied. Vatalanib 1250 mg orally was given once daily (cohort 1) or 750-1250 mg once daily in an intra-patient dose escalating schedule (cohort 2) in 28-day cycles to 155 patients with MDS; 142 patients were evaluable for response and 153 for toxicity. RESULTS: The median age was 70.5 years; 51 % had low risk (International Prognostic Scoring System {IPSS} Low/Intermediate-1) and 32 % had high risk (IPSS Intermediate-2/High) MDS. Hematological improvement was achieved in 7/142 (5 %) patients; all 7 were among the 47 patients able to remain on vatalanib for at least 3 months (hematological improvement achieved in 15 % of these 47 patients). For patients with low risk and high risk MDS, respectively, median progression-free survivals were 15 and 6 months, median times to transformation to AML were 28 and 6 months, and median overall survivals were 36 and 10 months. The most frequent non-hematological adverse events grade >/= 2 were fatigue, nausea or vomiting, dizziness, anorexia, ataxia, diarrhea, and pain. Two deaths (one intra-cerebral hemorrhage and one sudden death) were possibly related to vatalanib. CONCLUSIONS: Vatalanib induces improvement in blood counts in a small proportion of MDS patients. Clinical applicability is limited by side effects.","['Gupta, Pankaj', 'Mulkey, Flora', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Sanford, Ben L', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Hurd, David D', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi M', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Larson, Richard A']","['Gupta P', 'Mulkey F', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Sanford BL', 'Vij R', 'Hurd DD', 'Odenike OM', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Owzar K', 'Stone RM', 'Larson RA']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, gupta013@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['CA35113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86726/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA086726/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA008025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA059518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA114558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA037447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA016450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA012046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114558-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130523,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '5DX9U76296 (vatalanib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Phthalazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3773017,['NIHMS484207'],2013/05/24 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-013-9978-z [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2013 Oct;31(5):1311-20. doi: 10.1007/s10637-013-9978-z.

The correlation of the EGIL-classification with prognostically relevant parameters like age, prednisone response and risk group is analyzed. PATIENTS: Between March 2000 and June 2009 12 patients less than 1 year of age, 1 836 patients with 1 to less than 6 years, 620 patients with 6 to less than 10 years, 615 patients with 10 to less than 15 years and 275 patients with 15 to less than 19 years were analyzed with a comprehensive 4-color antibody panel and classified according to the EGIL recommendations. METHODS: Bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by ficoll gradient centrifugation, washed and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies. Cell preparations were acquired and analyzed on a flow cytometer. RESULTS: Centralized FCM was performed for 2 775 patients (82.6%) with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 493 patients (14.7%) with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 90 patients (2,7%) with biphenotypic acute leukemia. There was a slight overall predominance of male (56.1%) over female (43.9%) patients. Patients with B-cell precursor ALL had a slightly more favourable outcome with a 10 y pEFS of 78 +/- 1.0%, compared to patients with a T-ALL or BAL (biphenotypic acute leukemia) phenotype with a 10 y pEFS of 74 +/- 1.8% (n.s.) or 69 +/- 9.0% (p<0.009), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: FCM according to the EGIL recommendations not only provides diagnostic lineage determination and subclassification but also enables an initial prognostic orientation before MRD (minimal residual disease)-based risk stratification becomes available.","['Ratei, R', 'Schabath, R', 'Karawajew, L', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Moricke, A', 'Schrappe, M', 'Ludwig, W-D']","['Ratei R', 'Schabath R', 'Karawajew L', 'Zimmermann M', 'Moricke A', 'Schrappe M', 'Ludwig WD']","['HELIOS Klinikum Berlin Buch, Clinic for Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Berlin, Germany. richard.ratei@helios-kliniken.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130522,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/classification/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm, Residual/classification/drug therapy/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,2013/05/24 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1337961 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2013 May;225 Suppl 1:S34-9. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1337961.

The therapy plan was designed similar to that for the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The drugs with the highest efficacy in AML, cytarabine cutting catara-bine and anthracyclines, were combined during induction and consolidation, followed by preventive cranial irradiation and maintenance therapy similar to that in ALL. The remission rate of the initial study was 80%, and the 5-year survival rate increased from less than 10% before 1970 to 40%. 5 subsequent trials have further increased the 5-year survival to now 70% and even 90% in the subgroup of core-binding factor leukaemias by using an intensified and optimised treatment schedule.The AML-BFM studies were the only prospective study sequence testing the benefit of cranial irradiation. Results from study -87 including the non-randomized patients showed an increased risk of CNS and/or bone marrow relapses in non-irradiated patients. Later on there was evidence that 12 Gy resulted in the same relapse rate as 18 Gy. The AML-BFM studies always used the experience from the previous study to optimize the next study. This approach was essential together with improved supportive treatment and experience of the medical staff for the step-wise and considerable increase of longterm survival within the 6 subsequent AML-BFM studies.","['Creutzig, U', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Dworzak, M N', 'Ritter, J', 'Schellong, G', 'Reinhardt, D']","['Creutzig U', 'Zimmermann M', 'Dworzak MN', 'Ritter J', 'Schellong G', 'Reinhardt D']","['Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. ursula@creutzig.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130522,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'Acute erythroleukemia', 'BFM 78 protocol', 'DAV regimen', 'ICE protocol 4']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,2013/05/24 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1337968 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2013 May;225 Suppl 1:S79-86. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1337968.

Today, relapses have become relatively rare events in ALL although, because of the frequency of ALL, they are still a significant cause of death in children and adolescents. With currently used treatment modalities, cure rates of about 50% after relapse can be achieved, and, together with the improved results of front-line therapy, the survival rate of childhood ALL is now about 90%. Most children with extramedullary and late bone marrow (BM) relapses achieve a second CR; remission rates in patients with high-risk features, however, remain still unsatisfactory. With improved techniques allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has become a relatively safe treatment but is not necessary for all patients as postremission therapy. HSCT is not required in children with isolated extramedullary and late BM relapses with rapid response to induction therapy measured by molecular techniques (minimal residual disease, MRD) but absolutely indicated in patients with early BM relapses and systemic relapses of T-cell ALL. For patients with insufficient response innovative therapies such as small molecules or targeted immunological or pharmacological approaches are urgently required. Efforts have to be made, therefore, in order to detect potential biological or molecular targets, which can be used for individualized, more effective and hopefully less toxic therapies in the future.","['Henze, G', 'v Stackelberg, A', 'Eckert, C']","['Henze G', 'v Stackelberg A', 'Eckert C']","['Padiatrische Onkologie und Hamatologie, Charite CVK, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. guenter.henze@charite.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130522,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cytarabine', 'Daunorubicin', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine', 'Methotrexate', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine']",,,2013/05/24 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1337967 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2013 May;225 Suppl 1:S73-8. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1337967.

The major findings derived from these ALL-BFM trials were as follows: 1) preventive cranial radiotherapy could be safely reduced to 12 Gy in T-ALL and high-risk ALL patients and eliminated in non-high-risk non-T-ALL patients, if it was replaced by high-dose and intrathecal methotrexate; 2) omission of delayed reintensification severely impaired outcome of low-risk patients; 3) 6 months less maintenance therapy caused an increase in systemic relapses; 4) slow response to an initial 7-day prednisone window was identified as adverse prognostic factor; 5) condensed induction therapy resulted in a significant improvement of outcome; 6) the daunorubicin dose in induction could be safely reduced in low-risk patients; 7) intensification of consolidation/reintensification treatment led to considerable improvement of outcome in high-risk patients.","['Schrappe, M', 'Moricke, A', 'Reiter, A', 'Henze, G', 'Welte, K', 'Gadner, H', 'Ludwig, W-D', 'Ritter, J', 'Harbott, J', 'Mann, G', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Gruhn, B', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Kremens, B', 'Niggli, F', 'Debatin, K-M', 'Ratei, R', 'Stanulla, M', 'Beier, R', 'Cario, G', 'Schrauder, A', 'Zimmermann, M']","['Schrappe M', 'Moricke A', 'Reiter A', 'Henze G', 'Welte K', 'Gadner H', 'Ludwig WD', 'Ritter J', 'Harbott J', 'Mann G', 'Klingebiel T', 'Gruhn B', 'Niemeyer C', 'Kremens B', 'Niggli F', 'Debatin KM', 'Ratei R', 'Stanulla M', 'Beier R', 'Cario G', 'Schrauder A', 'Zimmermann M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany. m.schrappe@pediatrics.unikiel.de']",['eng'],,"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130522,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*history', 'Asparaginase/history', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/history', 'Cytarabine/history', 'Daunorubicin/history', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology/*history', 'Mercaptopurine/history', 'Methotrexate/history', 'Pediatrics/*history', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*history', 'Prednisone/history', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*history', 'Vincristine/history']",,,2013/05/24 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1337966 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2013 May;225 Suppl 1:S62-72. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1337966.

In the trial ALL-BFM 95, early cytomorphological marrow response on day 15 of induction therapy was prospectively evaluated and its prognostic value was analyzed in comparison to the prednisone response and other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Compared to prednisone response, day 15 marrow response was superior in outcome prediction - yet with differential effect depending on blast lineage. Outcome was poor in T cell leukemia patients with prednisone poor-response independent of day 15 marrow response, whereas among patients with prednisone good-response different risk groups could be identified by day 15 marrow response. In contrast, prednisone response lost prognostic significance in precursor B cell leukemia when stratified by day 15 marrow response. CONCLUSIONS: Selective addition of day 15 marrow response to conventional stratification criteria applied on ALL-BFM 95 may significantly improve risk-adapted treatment delivery. Even though cutting-edge trial risk stratification is meanwhile dominated by minimal residual disease evaluation, an improved conventional risk assessment, as presented here, could be of great importance to countries lacking the technical and/or financial resources associated with the application of minimal residual disease analysis.","['Moricke, A', 'Lauten, M', 'Beier, R', 'Odenwald, E', 'Stanulla, M', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Attarbaschi, A', 'Niggli, F', 'Schrappe, M']","['Moricke A', 'Lauten M', 'Beier R', 'Odenwald E', 'Stanulla M', 'Zimmermann M', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Niggli F', 'Schrappe M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. a.moericke@pediatrics.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130522,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,2013/05/24 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1337964 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2013 May;225 Suppl 1:S50-6. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1337964.

Some of these aberrations are independent prognostic indicators and help to stratify patients into different risk-adapted therapy groups.

In this longitudinal study the specific accent was put on the intensified induction treatment of 8 weeks' duration which was thought to achieve a higher remission quality. In this phase 8 effective drugs were applied up to the patient's tolerance limits; in addition prophylactic irradiation to the central nervous system was given in two modifications. After 4 weeks all patients were in complete remission. During the first 4 months 6 children died due to complications for which therapy must be at least partially responsible. 17 out of 67 patients relapsed between 4 and 59 months after diagnosis, which corresponds to a remission rate according to the life table analysis of 62% (50 out of 67 patients in first remission). The majority of patients with relapse is characterized at diagnosis by a specific pattern of clinical findings. 2 therapy groups, differently treated in respect to central nervous system irradiation and duration of continuation therapy, do not at present statistically differ from each other. According to statistics 8 more children may be expected to suffer from relapse. The improved results are due to a lower incidence of bone marrow relapses; it seems that there is a direct relation between intensity of treatment during the induction phase and the occurrence of bone marrow relapses. The specific problems of the presented study take place during the induction phase, which, due to toxicity, regularly results in a number of side effects and severe complications. In order to realize the induction therapy, the use of prophylactic and supportive procedures is of utmost importance. Profound knowledge of possible side effects and complications is most essential as well as the knowledge of how to cope with these problems. It is the authors' opinion that the induction phase can only be performed in specialized institutions, because only at these places enough information may be obtained from an adequate number of patients and only there pediatric oncologists may share in the decisions and responsibilities. Only by using every kind of medical service this method of therapy may be justified at present, according to the results of this study, for the benefit of children with leukemia.","['Riehm, H', 'Gadner, H', 'Welte, K']","['Riehm H', 'Gadner H', 'Welte K']","['Abteilung fur Padiatrie II mit Schwerpunkt Hamatologie der Kinderklinik der Freien Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20130522,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,,,,,2013/05/24 06:00,2013/05/24 06:01,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1337959 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2013 May;225 Suppl 1:S16-29. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1337959.

However, the role of WT1 in hematopoiesis remains unclear. We show that Wt1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells exhibit reduced hematopoietic potential caused by vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegf-a)-dependent apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells associated with overproduction of the Vegf-a120 isoform. We demonstrate that Wt1 promotes exon inclusion using a Vegf-a minigene-based splicing assay. These data identify a critical role for Wt1 in hematopoiesis and Vegf-a as a cellular RNA whose splicing is potentially regulated by Wt1. The correction of Wt1 deficiency by treatment with exogenous Vegf-a protein indicates that the Wt1/Vegf-a axis is a molecular pathway that could be exploited for the management/treatment of poor prognosis AMLs.","['Cunningham, Thomas J', 'Palumbo, Ilaria', 'Grosso, Michela', 'Slater, Nicholas', 'Miles, Colin G']","['Cunningham TJ', 'Palumbo I', 'Grosso M', 'Slater N', 'Miles CG']","['Newcastle University Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['BBS/B/11699/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130522,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/05/24 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56090-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-466086 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jul 11;122(2):188-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-466086.

In this study, we sought to determine whether hBDs activate murine and human mast cells and to delineate the mechanisms of their regulation. hBD2 and hBD3 did not induce degranulation in murine peritoneal or bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) in vitro and had no effect on vascular permeability in vivo. By contrast, these peptides induced sustained Ca(2+) mobilization and substantial degranulation in human mast cells, with hBD3 being more potent. Pertussis toxin (PTx) had no effect on hBD-induced Ca(2+) mobilization, but La(3+) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (a dual inhibitor of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and transient receptor potential channels) caused substantial inhibition of this response. Interestingly, degranulation induced by hBDs was substantially inhibited by PTx, La(3+), or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. Whereas human mast cells endogenously express G protein-coupled receptor, Mas-related gene X2 (MrgX2), rat basophilic leukemia, RBL-2H3 cells, and murine BMMCs do not. Silencing the expression of MrgX2 in human mast cells inhibited hBD-induced degranulation, but had no effect on anaphylatoxin C3a-induced response. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MrgX2 in RBL-2H3 and murine BMMCs rendered these cells responsive to hBDs for degranulation. This study demonstrates that hBDs activate human mast cells via MrgX2, which couples to both PTx-sensitive and insensitive signaling pathways most likely involving Galphaq and Galphai to induce degranulation. Furthermore, murine mast cells are resistant to hBDs for degranulation, and this reflects the absence of MrgX2 in these cells.","['Subramanian, Hariharan', 'Gupta, Kshitij', 'Lee, Donguk', 'Bayir, Arzu K', 'Ahn, Harry', 'Ali, Hydar']","['Subramanian H', 'Gupta K', 'Lee D', 'Bayir AK', 'Ahn H', 'Ali H']","['Department of Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6030, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL085774/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL085774/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130522,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DEFB103A protein, human)', '0 (DEFB4A protein, human)', '0 (MRGPRX2 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide)', '0 (beta-Defensins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Signaling/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'beta-Defensins/*physiology']",PMC3691353,['NIHMS476083'],2013/05/24 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1300023 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1300023 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Jul 1;191(1):345-52. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1300023.

Here we report the analysis of patterns of pathogen adaptation and virulence evolution from viruses adapting to one of three hosts that differ across the entire genome (A/WySn, DBA/2J and BALB/c). We found that serial passage of FV complex through these mouse genotypes resulted in significant increases in pathogen fitness (156-fold) and virulence (11-fold). Adaptive responses by post-passage viruses also resulted in host-genotype-specific patterns of adaptation. To evaluate the relative importance of MHC versus non-MHC polymorphisms as factors influencing pathogen adaptation and virulence, we compared the magnitude of fitness tradeoffs incurred by post-passage viruses when infecting hosts possessing either novel MHC polymorphisms alone or hosts possessing novel MHC and non-MHC polymorphisms. MHC polymorphisms alone accounted for 71% and 83% of the total observed reductions in viral fitness and virulence in unfamiliar host genotypes, respectively. Strikingly, these data suggest that genetic polymorphisms within the MHC, a gene region representing only -0.1% of the genome, are major host factors influencing pathogen adaptation and virulence evolution.","['Kubinak, J L', 'Ruff, J S', 'Cornwall, D H', 'Middlebrook, E A', 'Hasenkrug, K J', 'Potts, W K']","['Kubinak JL', 'Ruff JS', 'Cornwall DH', 'Middlebrook EA', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Potts WK']","['Department of Biology, University of Utah, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA. jason.kubinak@path.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 GM039578/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM109500/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA AI000753-17/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130523,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,,IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological/*genetics', 'Animals', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Genotype', 'Host Specificity', '*Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Virulence/genetics']",PMC4517933,['NIHMS556197'],2013/05/24 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['gene201327 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2013.27 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2013 Sep;14(6):365-72. doi: 10.1038/gene.2013.27.

Upon central nervous system (CNS) infection, Env is expressed as multiple isoforms owing to differential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation. Because N-glycosylation can affect protein folding, stability, and quality control, we explored whether unique CasBrE Env glycosylation features could influence neurovirulence. CasBrE Env possesses 6/8 consensus MLV glycosylation sites (gs) but is missing gs3 and gs5 and contains a putative site (gs*). Twenty-nine mutants were generated by modifying these three sites, individually or in combination, to mimic the amino acid sequence in the nonneurovirulent Friend 57 MLV. Three basic viral phenotypes were observed: replication defective (dead; titer < 1 focus-forming unit [FFU]/ml), replication compromised (RC) (titer = 10(2) to 10(5) FFU/ml); and wild-type-like (WTL) (titer > 10(5) FFU/ml). Env protein was undetectable in dead mutants, while RC and WTL mutants showed variations in Env expression, processing, virus incorporation, virus entry, and virus spread. The newly introduced gs3 and gs5 sites were glycosylated, whereas gs* was not. Six WTL mutants tested in mice showed no clear attenuation in disease onset or severity versus controls. Furthermore, three RC viruses tested by neural stem cell (NSC)-mediated brainstem dissemination also induced acute spongiosis. Thus, while unique N-glycosylation affected structural features of Env involved in protein stability, proteolytic processing, and virus assembly and entry, these changes had minimal impact on CasBrE Env neurotoxicity. These findings suggest that the Env protein domains responsible for spongiogenesis represent highly stable elements upon which the more variable viral functional domains have evolved.","['Renszel, Krystal M', 'Traister, Russell S', 'Lynch, William P']","['Renszel KM', 'Traister RS', 'Lynch WP']","['Department of Integrative Medical Sciences, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS037614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS37614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130522,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Canavan Disease/pathology/virology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Mice', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication']",PMC3719805,,2013/05/24 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00392-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00392-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Aug;87(15):8372-87. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00392-13.

However, the involvement of intra- and interchromosomal interactions in development and oncogenesis remains unclear. TAL1/SCL is a critical transcription factor required for the development of all hematopoietic lineages; yet, aberrant TAL1 transcription often occurs in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we report that oncogenic TAL1 expression is regulated by different intra- and interchromosomal loops in normal hematopoietic and leukemic cells, respectively. These intra- and interchromosomal loops alter the cell-type-specific enhancers that interact with the TAL1 promoter. We show that human SET1 (hSET1)-mediated H3K4 methylations promote a long-range chromatin loop, which brings the +51 enhancer in close proximity to TAL1 promoter 1 in erythroid cells. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) facilitates this long-range enhancer/promoter interaction of the TAL1 locus in erythroid cells while blocking the same enhancer/promoter interaction of the TAL1 locus in human T-cell leukemia. In human T-ALL, a T-cell-specific transcription factor c-Maf-mediated interchromosomal interaction brings the TAL1 promoter into close proximity with a T-cell-specific regulatory element located on chromosome 16, activating aberrant TAL1 oncogene expression. Thus, our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism involving changes in three-dimensional chromatin interactions that activate the TAL1 oncogene in human T-cell leukemia.","['Patel, B', 'Kang, Y', 'Cui, K', 'Litt, M', 'Riberio, M S J', 'Deng, C', 'Salz, T', 'Casada, S', 'Fu, X', 'Qiu, Y', 'Zhao, K', 'Huang, S']","['Patel B', 'Kang Y', 'Cui K', 'Litt M', 'Riberio MS', 'Deng C', 'Salz T', 'Casada S', 'Fu X', 'Qiu Y', 'Zhao K', 'Huang S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', '1] Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA [2] College of Life Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Center for System Biology, NHLBI, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Medical Education Center, Ball State University, Muncie, IN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Medical Education Center, Ball State University, Muncie, IN, USA.', 'College of Life Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', '1] Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA [2] Shands Cancer Center, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Center for System Biology, NHLBI, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '1] Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA [2] Shands Cancer Center, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['5T32CA009126-35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL090589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL091929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL091929-01A1S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL095674/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130523,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Setd1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Epistasis, Genetic', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Order', 'Genetic Loci', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,2013/05/24 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013158 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.158 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Feb;28(2):349-61. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.158.

Chronic medical conditions are recognized as increasing the risk for complications of influenza virus infection. Although most studies including children with acute leukemia and H1N1 virus have reported no deaths, some anectodal reports with low patient numbers have reported mortality rates as high as 28.5%. Here, we report patients with leukemia and H1N1 virus and review the literature. METHODS: Medical records of all children with leukemia and H1N1 virus in our institution were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. We also carried out a systematic review of the English-language literature. Among the 24 articles found, only patients with leukemia and pandemic H1N1 infections were reviewed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Eight of 98 children who received chemotherapy for leukemia were diagnosed with pandemic H1N1 infection. One developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and died. Another one developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and died due to secondary infection during the 6th week of treatment for HLH. In our study, 2 of 8 patients had a fatal course (25%), compared with an overall mortality of 2.5% in the studies retrieved from PubMed (6/232). CONCLUSION: Pandemic H1N1 influenza virus caused mortality in patients with ARDS or HLH; an unexpected finding for pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza virus. Thus, for children with leukemia and infected with H1N1 virus, short- and long-term complications should be kept in mind during evaluation.","['Yontem, Yaman', 'Ilker, Devrim', 'Yesim, Oymak', 'Aysen, Turedi', 'Gulcihan, Ozek', 'Ozgur, Carti', 'Meral, Akcay Ciblak', 'Burcak, Tatli Gunes', 'Bengu, Demirag', 'Esin, Albudak', 'Selim, Badur', 'Canan, Vergin']","['Yontem Y', 'Ilker D', 'Yesim O', 'Aysen T', 'Gulcihan O', 'Ozgur C', 'Meral AC', 'Burcak TG', 'Bengu D', 'Esin A', 'Selim B', 'Canan V']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Dr. Behcet Uz Children's Hospital, Izmir, Turkey. yontemyaman@gmail.com""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130522,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*isolation & purification', 'Influenza, Human/drug therapy/*epidemiology/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/virology', 'Male', '*Pandemics', 'Prognosis', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",,,2013/05/24 06:00,2014/03/14 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2013.796025 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Aug;30(5):437-44. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2013.796025.

In cultured cells, plitidepsin induces cell cycle arrest or an acute apoptotic process in which sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays a crucial role. With a view to optimizing clinical use of plitidepsin, we have therefore evaluated the possibility of using JNK activation as an in vivo biomarker of response. In this study, we show that administration of a single plitidepsin dose to mice xenografted with human cancer cells does indeed lead to increased phosphorylation of JNK in tumors at 4 to 12 h. By contrast, no changes were found in other in vitro plitidepsin targets such as the levels of phosphorylated-ERK, -p38MAPK or the protein p27KIP1. Interestingly, plitidepsin also increased JNK phosphorylation in spleens from xenografted mice showing similar kinetics to those seen in tumors, thereby suggesting that normal tissues might be useful for predicting drug activity. Furthermore, plitidepsin administration to rats at plasma concentrations comparable to those achievable in patients also increased JNK phosphorylation in peripheral mononuclear blood cells. These findings suggest that changes in JNK activity provide a reliable biomarker for plitidepsin activity and this could be useful for designing clinical trials and maximizing the efficacy of plitidepsin.","['Munoz-Alonso, Maria J', 'Alvarez, Enrique', 'Guillen-Navarro, Maria Jose', 'Pollan, Marina', 'Aviles, Pablo', 'Galmarini, Carlos M', 'Munoz, Alberto']","['Munoz-Alonso MJ', 'Alvarez E', 'Guillen-Navarro MJ', 'Pollan M', 'Aviles P', 'Galmarini CM', 'Munoz A']","['PharmaMar, Avda.

This modification creates a binding site for MBD (methyl-CpG-binding domain) proteins which target chromatin-modifying activities that are thought to contribute to transcriptional repression and maintain heterochromatic regions of the genome. In contrast with DNA methylation, which is found broadly across vertebrate genomes, non-methylated DNA is concentrated in regions known as CGIs (CpG islands). Recently, a family of proteins which encode a ZF-CxxC (zinc finger-CxxC) domain have been shown to specifically recognize non-methylated DNA and recruit chromatin-modifying activities to CGI elements. For example, CFP1 (CxxC finger protein 1), MLL (mixed lineage leukaemia protein), KDM (lysine demethylase) 2A and KDM2B regulate lysine methylation on histone tails, whereas TET (ten-eleven translocation) 1 and TET3 hydroxylate methylated cytosine bases.

Despite our improved understanding of the physiology of the disease, little is yet known about the causes of leukemia. A variety of potential risk factors have been suggested so far, including personal habits and lifestyle, and a wide range of occupational or environmental exposures. A causal association with leukemia has only been documented to date for ionizing radiation, benzene and treatment with cytostatic drugs, but there is an ongoing scientific debate on the possible association of leukemia with a number of other work-related hazards. In this article, we have reviewed scientific studies, published over the past 5 years, which investigated potential associations between leukemia and exposure to occupational risk factors. The systematic literature review took place via electronic databases, using specific search criteria, and independent reviewers have further filtered the search results to identify the number of articles, presented in our paper. A large number of studies included in the review referred to the effects of ionizing radiation, where new data suggest that the effects of exposure to small doses of ionizing radiation should probably be reevaluated. Some other works appear to substantiate a potential association of the disease with certain pesticides. Further research is also suggested regarding the role of infectious agents or exposure to certain chemicals like formaldehyde or butadiene in the pathogenesis of leukemia.","['Polychronakis, Ioannis', 'Dounias, George', 'Makropoulos, Vasilios', 'Riza, Elena', 'Linos, Athena']","['Polychronakis I', 'Dounias G', 'Makropoulos V', 'Riza E', 'Linos A']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, University of Athens, Medical School, 75 Mikras Asias 115 27, Goudi, Athens, Greece. drjpoly@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130522,England,J Occup Med Toxicol,"Journal of occupational medicine and toxicology (London, England)",101245790,,,,PMC3668148,,2013/05/24 06:00,2013/05/24 06:01,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/24 06:01 [medline]']","['1745-6673-8-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1745-6673-8-14 [doi]']",epublish,J Occup Med Toxicol. 2013 May 22;8(1):14. doi: 10.1186/1745-6673-8-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result they may affect the way patients accept their disease and determine subjective assessment of quality of life. The objective of this study was to recognise strategies for coping with pain, evaluate the process of accepting the disease and assess quality of life among adolescents diagnosed with hematopoietic malignancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 66 patients aged between 14 and 21 and diagnosed with leukaemia or lymphoma. The following measuring tools were used: the Pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), and WHOQOL-BREF for quality of life evaluation. RESULTS: Coping self-statements and praying or hoping were the two most common strategies used by our respondents when coping with pain. In the study group the level of anxiety had no influence on pain control and the ability to reduce it. A statistically significant relation was found between the level of catastrophizing as a method of coping with pain and quality of life in the physical domain. An additional correlation was observed between quality of life in the psychological domain and the level of pain control. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of coping with pain promotes the acceptance of illness and improves patient's quality of life. The age and duration of the disease were factors affecting strategies for coping with pain. A small percentage of respondents who experienced anxiety suggests that further and deeper research is needed in this field.","['Cepuch, Grazyna', 'Wojnar-Gruszka, Katarzyna', 'Kowalczyk, Marta']","['Cepuch G', 'Wojnar-Gruszka K', 'Kowalczyk M']","['Department of Clinical Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland. grazyna.cepuch@uj.edu.pl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Poland,Folia Med Cracov,Folia medica Cracoviensia,0374617,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Anxiety/etiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pain/etiology/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,2012/01/01 00:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2013/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Folia Med Cracov. 2012;52(1-2):71-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This molecule provides a co-stimulatory signal that enhances the survival, and differentiation of cells, and has a crucial role in the development of CD8 cytotoxic T cells and anti-tumor immunity. Here we report that CD137 expression is also induced on normal or malignant human B cells by CD40 ligation by its ligand CD154. This CD137 induction was more prominent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells than in other types of B cells. CD137 stimulation on B cells by its ligand induced the nuclear translocation of p52 (a non-canonical NF-kappaB factor). In agreement with this finding, expression of the survival factor BCL-XL was upregulated. Consequently, the CD137 signal augmented the survival of CD154-stimulated CLL B cells in vitro. This unexpected induction of CD137 on B cells by CD40 signal may influence the clinical course of CLL.","['Nakaima, Yukana', 'Watanabe, Ken', 'Koyama, Takatoshi', 'Miura, Osamu', 'Fukuda, Tetsuya']","['Nakaima Y', 'Watanabe K', 'Koyama T', 'Miura O', 'Fukuda T']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/agonists/*metabolism']",PMC3655981,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0064425 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-00660 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 16;8(5):e64425. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064425.

We report here that a derivative of oleanolic acid, olean-12-eno[2,3-c] [1], [2], [5]oxadiazol-28-oic acid (designated OEOA) effectively blocks the proliferation of human leukemia cells. OEOA significantly reduces cell proliferation without inducing cell death in three types of leukemia cell lines, including K562, HEL and Jurket. Moreover, exposure of K562 cells to OEOA results in G1 cell cycle arrest, with a concomitant induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and downregulation of cyclins and Cdks that are essential for cell cycle progression. Interestingly, OEOA also enhances erythroid differentiation in K562 cells through suppressing the expression of Bcr-Abl and phosphorylation of Erk1/2. These findings identify a novel chemical entity for further development as therapeutics against leukemia.","['Ng, Yu Pong', 'Chen, Yuewen', 'Hu, Yueqing', 'Ip, Fanny C F', 'Ip, Nancy Y']","['Ng YP', 'Chen Y', 'Hu Y', 'Ip FC', 'Ip NY']","['Division of Life Science, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Oleanolic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects']",PMC3656051,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0063580 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-38201 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 16;8(5):e63580. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0063580.

SHP2, NF-1, KRAS, and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients, leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL, leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H, a linker region mutant, and CBL-C384R, a RING finger mutant, lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor betac subunit in response to stimulation, although expression of total GM-CSFR betac was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR betac in cells expressing CBL mutants, whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR betac phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.","['Javadi, Mojib', 'Richmond, Terri D', 'Huang, Kai', 'Barber, Dwayne L']","['Javadi M', 'Richmond TD', 'Huang K', 'Barber DL']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Campbell Family Cancer Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],['FRN#42428/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130521,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '6L1XP550I6 (Fedratinib)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dasatinib', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'RING Finger Domains/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC3707649,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/09/14 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45660-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.475087 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Jul 5;288(27):19459-70. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.475087.

This chapter looks in depth at the initial discovery and characterisation of Musashi in the model organism Drosophila, and its subsequent emergence as a master regulator in a number of stem cell populations. Furthermore the unique roles for mammalian Musashi-1 and Musashi-2 in different stem cell types are correlated with the perceived diagnostic power of Musashi expression in specific stem cell derived oncologies. In particular the potential role for Musashi in the identification and treatment of human cancer is considered, with a focus on the role of Musashi-2 in leukaemia. Finally, the manipulation of Musashi expression is proposed as a potential avenue towards the targeted treatment of specific aggressive stem cell cancers.","['Sutherland, Jessie M', 'McLaughlin, Eileen A', 'Hime, Gary R', 'Siddall, Nicole A']","['Sutherland JM', 'McLaughlin EA', 'Hime GR', 'Siddall NA']","['Priority Research Centre in Reproductive Science, School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (MSI1 protein, human)', '0 (MSI2 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (msi protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/09/18 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-94-007-6621-1_13 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;786:233-45. doi: 10.1007/978-94-007-6621-1_13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD22 has emerged as an ideal target for monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapy of B-cell malignancies including most lymphomas and many leukemias. Epratuzumab, an anti-CD22 mAb, has been developed in various forms, including as an unlabeled (naked) mAb, as a radioimmunotherapeutic, as an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), and as a vehicle for CD22-targeted nanoparticles. While clinical trials with unlabeled epratuzumab have demonstrated modest results, its combination with rituximab in phase II studies has been more encouraging. Based on the potential for CD22 to become internalized, CD22-targeted constructs carrying radioisotopes or toxins have generated promising results. Radioimmunotherapy, utilizing (9)(0)Y-labeled epratuzumab, was shown to be highly effective in patients with follicular lymphoma, generating a complete response (CR) rate of 92 % and progression-free survival of more than 2 years. ADC therapy is a promising therapeutic approach to B-cell malignancies which includes the direct conjugation of mAbs with cytotoxic agents. Phase II studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin, an ADC which combines anti-CD22 mAb with calicheamicin, an enediyne antibiotic which mediates apoptosis, in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have produced an overall response rate (ORR) of greater than 50 % in treatment-refractory patients. Phase I trials of moxetumomab pasudotox, an ADC which combines anti-CD22 with PE38, a fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, have been completed in hairy cell leukemia with a ORR of 86 %. Finally, a review of CD22-targeted nanoparticles, that include a doxorubicin-containing lipid complex that uses synthetic high-affinity CD22 ligand mimetics as well as anti-CD22 mAb-coated pegylated liposomas doxorubin (PLD), has demonstrated promising results in pre-clinical models of human lymphoma. Moreover, novel anti-CD22 mAb that block CD22 ligand binding as well as second generation ADC that utilize biodegradable linkers and more potent toxins hold great hope for the future of CD22-targeted therapeutics that may translate into better outcomes for patients with CD22-positive malignancies.","['Sullivan-Chang, Loretta', ""O'Donnell, Robert T"", 'Tuscano, Joseph M']","['Sullivan-Chang L', ""O'Donnell RT"", 'Tuscano JM']","['Peak Vista Community Health Centers, Colorado Springs, CO, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/adverse effects', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects', 'Nanoparticles/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/02/18 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40259-013-0016-7 [doi]'],ppublish,BioDrugs. 2013 Aug;27(4):293-304. doi: 10.1007/s40259-013-0016-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These molecular changes may introduce varied extents of resistance to different therapies and need to be characterized for optimal therapy choice. A recently discovered small molecule, ethyl-2-amino-6-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carbo xylate) (CXL017), reveals selective cytotoxicity toward drug-resistant leukemia. A drug-resistant acute myeloid leukemia cell line, HL60/MX2, also failed to acquire resistance to CXL017 upon chronic exposure and regained sensitivity toward standard therapies. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for HL60/MX2 cells' drug resistance and the molecular basis for its resensitization. Results show that the HL60/MX2 cell line has an elevated level of Mcl-1 protein relative to the parental cell line, HL60, and its resensitized cell line, HL60/MX2/CXL017, whereas it has a reduced level of topoisomerase IIbeta. Mcl-1 overexpression in HL60/MX2 cells is mainly regulated through phospho-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2-mediated Mcl-1 stabilization, whereas the reduction of topoisomerase IIbeta in HL60/MX2 cells is controlled through genetic downregulation. Upregulating Mcl-1 introduces multidrug resistance to standard therapies, whereas its downregulation results in significant cell death. Downregulating topoisomerase IIbeta confers resistance specifically to mitoxantrone, not to other topoisomerase II inhibitors. Overall, these data suggest that Mcl-1 overexpression is a critical determinant for cross-resistance to standard therapies, whereas topoisomerase IIbeta downregulation is specific to mitoxantrone resistance.","['Hermanson, David L', 'Das, Sonia G', 'Li, Yunfang', 'Xing, Chengguo']","['Hermanson DL', 'Das SG', 'Li Y', 'Xing C']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA163864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA163864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130521,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate', ')', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC3716322,,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.113.086140 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.113.086140 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2013 Aug;84(2):236-43. doi: 10.1124/mol.113.086140.

CD5 expressing DLBCL (CD5+ DLBCL) is increasingly recognized as a subtype of DLBCL with an aggressive disease course. Primary CD5+ DLBCL comprises approximately 5-10% of DLBCL. Few studies of CD5+ DLBCL have been reported, primarily from Japan. Publications covered in this review include articles published on PubMed and abstracts from major international conferences until April 2013. Common features of patients with CD5+ DLBCL are older age, female preponderance, elevated LDH, more extra-nodal involvement, poor performance status (PS), higher incidence of CNS involvement, inferior response to rituximab-containing regimens (as compared to CD5- DLBCL) and advanced stage. The majority of these cases belong to the activated B cell subtype (ABC) of DLBCL. It is unclear whether CD5 expression in malignant B cells may confer chemo resistance, upregulate antiapoptotic signals and alter the microenvironment. Molecular techniques have helped in understanding CD5+ DLBCL. Gene expression signature was similar in ABC-DLBCL and CD5+ DLBCL in some studies. Despite the better characterization treatment outcomes are poor and additional studies are needed.","['Jain, Preetesh', 'Fayad, Luis E', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Young, Ken H', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Jain P', 'Fayad LE', 'Rosenwald A', 'Young KH', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130605,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Rituximab', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23467 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Sep;88(9):798-802. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23467.

Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis. DIAGNOSIS: Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation. When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation highly suggests the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of ET should include reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, prefibrotic myelofibrosis and RARS-T (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis). A JAK2 mutation is found in 50-70% of patients with ET, myelofibrosis or RARS-T and is capable of distinguishing reactive from clonal thrombocytosis. RISK STRATIFICATION: Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age >60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Recent data considers JAK2V617F and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as additional risk factors for thrombosis. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 x 10(9) /L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is <1%/1% in ET and <3%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In low risk patients, this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin in both PV and ET and phlebotomy (hematocrit target of <45%) in PV. In high risk patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally recommended, although not mandated in older patients without JAK2V617F or CV risk factors. Treatment with busulfan or interferon-alpha is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures. Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.","['Tefferi, Ayalew']",['Tefferi A'],"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Humans', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/*diagnosis/*therapy']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23417 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Jun;88(6):507-16. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23417.,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of calcium homeostasis has been reported in a wide variety of pathological conditions including cardiovascular disorders, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. One of the most ubiquitous pathways involved in regulated Ca(2+) influx into cells is the store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) pathway. In 2006, Orai1 was identified as the channel protein that mediates SOCE in immune cells. Orai1 has two mammalian homologs, Orai2 and Orai3. Although Orai1 has been the most widely studied Orai isoform, Orai3 has recently received significant attention. Under native conditions, Orai3 was demonstrated to be an important component of store-independent arachidonate-regulated Ca(2+) (ARC) entry in HEK293 cells, and more recently of a store-independent leukotrieneC4-regulated Ca(2+) (LRC) entry pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells. Recent studies have shown upregulation of Orai3 in estrogen receptor-expressing breast cancers and a critical role for Orai3 in breast cancer development in immune-compromised mice. Orai3 upregulation was also shown to contribute to vascular smooth muscle remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia caused by vascular injury. Furthermore, Orai3 has been shown to contribute to proliferation of effector T-lymphocytes under oxidative stress. In this review, we will discuss the role of Orai3 in reported pathophysiological conditions and will contribute ideas on the potential role of Orai3 in native Ca(2+) signaling pathways and human disease.","['Motiani, Rajender K', 'Stolwijk, Judith A', 'Newton, Rachel L', 'Zhang, Xuexin', 'Trebak, Mohamed']","['Motiani RK', 'Stolwijk JA', 'Newton RL', 'Zhang X', 'Trebak M']","['Nanobioscience Constellation; College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE); University at Albany; State University of New York; Albany, NY USA; DST-INSPIRE Faculty; Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB); New Delhi, India.', 'Nanobioscience Constellation; College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE); University at Albany; State University of New York; Albany, NY USA.', 'Nanobioscience Constellation; College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE); University at Albany; State University of New York; Albany, NY USA.', 'Nanobioscience Constellation; College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE); University at Albany; State University of New York; Albany, NY USA.', 'Nanobioscience Constellation; College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE); University at Albany; State University of New York; Albany, NY USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL097111/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL097111/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130521,United States,Channels (Austin),"Channels (Austin, Tex.)",101321614,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Orai3 protein, human)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress']",PMC3913762,,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['24960 [pii]', '10.4161/chan.24960 [doi]']",ppublish,Channels (Austin). 2013 Sep-Oct;7(5):392-401. doi: 10.4161/chan.24960.

The purpose of this review is to outline the most recent advances in the biology, genetics and prognostic significance of this aggressive disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Detailed immunophenotypic analyses have defined ETP T-ALLs as a distinct group of T-ALL with a poor prognosis. Transcriptionally, ETP T-ALLs and early immature T-ALLs, a broader group of tumours characterized by very early arrest in T-cell differentiation, are most related to haematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors. Consistently, these leukaemias show lower frequencies of prototypical T-ALL lesions such as CDKN2A/B deletions and activating mutations in NOTCH1 and show a higher prevalence of mutations typically associated with the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs). SUMMARY: ETP and early immature T-ALLs are characterized by a very early differentiation arrest and show unique genetic and transcriptional features that overlap both with T-ALL and with AML. Given the unique biology and poor prognosis associated with the ETP T-ALL group, there is an urgent need of new tailored therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.","['Haydu, J Erika', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Haydu JE', 'Ferrando AA']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics and Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['F30 CA174099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3886681,['NIHMS543023'],2013/05/23 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283623c61 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2013 Jul;20(4):369-73. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283623c61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review describes the recent advances on the role of galectins in hematological neoplasms. RECENT FINDINGS: Galectin-1 and galectin-3 are the best studied galectins in oncohematology. Increased expression of galectin-1 has been associated with tumor progression in Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, whereas galectin-3 plays a supporting role in chronic myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma. Functional studies have assigned a key role for galectin-1 as a negative regulator of T-cell immunity in Hodgkin's lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Of therapeutic interest is the development of agents with the capacity to interfere with galectin functions. SUMMARY: Current knowledge indicates a key role for galectins in hematological neoplasms by favoring the growth and survival of tumor cells and facilitating tumor immune escape. Intervention using specific galectin inhibitors is emerging as an attractive therapeutic option to alter the course of these malignancies.","['Giordano, Mirta', 'Croci, Diego O', 'Rabinovich, Gabriel A']","['Giordano M', 'Croci DO', 'Rabinovich GA']","['Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas (IMEX/CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Galectins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Galectins/*physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328362370f [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2013 Jul;20(4):327-35. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328362370f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Odds ratios (OR) were calculated. RESULTS: Asthma was positively associated with AL development (OR=4.18; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.47-11.87), whereas skin allergies were negatively associated (OR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.20-0.91). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that allergies and AL in children with DS share biological and immune mechanisms.

The improvement of long-term stabilization and cure of older APL patients is therefore a particular challenge. Data of unselected population-based studies suggest a high rate of exclusion from clinical trials in older age. The comparison of registry and study data indicates that study patients represent a positive selection. Older APL patients seem as sensitive to therapy as younger patients. With conventional therapy, based on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy, over 50 % of older APL patients can probably be cured. Special problems of advanced age are the high rate of early death before or during induction therapy and the high frequency of death in remission with negative influence on the outcome. Both may be related in part to a higher vulnerability against the common treatment with ATRA and chemotherapy. Alternative less toxic approaches including arsenic trioxide (ATO) with or without ATRA and combinations with gemtuzumab ozogamicin or with reduced chemotherapy can induce long-lasting remission in all stages of APL. Considering the high curative potential and the excellent tolerance of ATO in newly diagnosed and relapsed APL, older patients are probably a particular target group for a chemotherapy-free approach with ATO.","['Lengfelder, Eva', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Nolte, Florian']","['Lengfelder E', 'Hofmann WK', 'Nolte F']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany. eva.lengfelder@umm.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130522,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",PMC3734597,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1788-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Sep;92(9):1181-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1788-z.

For all these reasons, adherence in cancer therapy is critical for an optimal benefit-risk ratio. Patient adherence remains virtually unexplored in many cancers, such as malignant blood diseases. When measured, adherence is poor, especially when the drug is administered as oral and prolonged therapy (hormonotherapy in breast cancer, imatinib). Physician nonadherence represents another form of drug misadministration; poorly documented, its mechanism remains obscure. Adherence may be measured by a panel of methods, each of them displaying limits and pitfalls, suggesting that several complementary methods should be used in the context of prospective studies. Risk factors are age, socio-educative profile, disease stage and physician profile. This review emphasizes some methods to prevent nonadherence. Finally, this review argues for prospective studies, which should integrate a social pharmacology approach, including medicine, psycho-sociology and economics.","['Despas, Fabien', 'Roche, Henri', 'Laurent, Guy']","['Despas F', 'Roche H', 'Laurent G']","[""CHU de Toulouse, centre Midi-Pyrenees de pharmacovigilance, de pharmacoepidemiologie et d'informations sur le medicament, service de pharmacologie clinique, 37, allees Jules-Guesde, 31000 Toulouse, France. fabien.despas@univ-tlse3.fr""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', ""Physician's Role"", 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/07/25 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007-4551(15)30338-6 [pii]', '10.1684/bdc.2013.1738 [doi]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2013 May;100(5):473-84. doi: 10.1684/bdc.2013.1738.,,['NOTNLM'],"['adherence', 'cancer', 'drug', 'social pharmacology']",,Observance des medicaments anticancereux.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors examined NTDC-related hospitalization trends in the United States and identified the relationship between complex chronic condition (CCCs) and NTDC-related inpatient hospitalizations. We analyzed data from the U.S. Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2000-2010) for children ages 3 to 17 years (N = 3,030,970). The predictor variable was number of CCCs (0/1/2+). The outcome variable was whether the child had a NTDC-related hospitalization (no/yes). Covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate prevalence odds ratios (PORs). From 2000 to 2010, there were 17,993 NTDC-related hospitalizations (0.59%) and a slight increase in NTDC-related hospitalizations (p = .049). This increase was not significant in the final regression model. There was no difference in odds of NTDCs for children with 0 or 1 CCCs (POR = 1.08; 95%CI = 0.99, 1.18), but children with 2+ CCCs had significantly greater odds (POR = 1.61; 95%CI = 1.42, 1.83), as did non-White, publicly insured, and lower income children. NTDC-related hospitalizations for children did not increase from 2000 to 2010. Children with 2+ CCCs had the greatest odds of being hospitalized for NTDCs, which highlights the need to develop preventive interventions targeting children with 2+ CCCs.","['Chi, D L', 'Masterson, E E']","['Chi DL', 'Masterson EE']","['University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. dchi@uw.edu']",['eng'],"['T90DE021884/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'T90 DE021984/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'K08DE020856/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 HD042828/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DE020856/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R24HD042828/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130521,United States,J Dent Res,Journal of dental research,0354343,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cerebral Palsy/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dental Caries/epidemiology', 'Dental Pulp Diseases/epidemiology', 'Dental Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Income/statistics & numerical data', 'Insurance, Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medicaid/statistics & numerical data', 'Medicare/statistics & numerical data', 'Mouth Diseases/epidemiology', 'Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data', 'Periapical Diseases/epidemiology', 'Poverty/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Seizures/epidemiology', 'Tooth Diseases/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",PMC3711566,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['0022034513490733 [pii]', '10.1177/0022034513490733 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dent Res. 2013 Aug;92(8):682-8. doi: 10.1177/0022034513490733.

Although several genes are known to be involved in the progression to blastic phase, molecular mechanisms for the evolution toward blast crisis have not been fully identified. Oncogenic stimuli enforce cell proliferation, which requires DNA replication. Unscheduled DNA replication enforced by oncogenic stimuli leads to double strand breaks on DNA. We found the DNA damage-response pathway is activated in bone marrow of chronic-phase CML patients possibly due to an enforced proliferation signal by BCR-ABL expression. Since ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a central player of the DNA damage-response pathway, we studied whether loss of this pathway accelerates blast crisis. We crossed Atm-knockout mice with BCR-ABL transgenic mice to test this hypothesis. Interestingly, the loss of one of the Atm alleles was shown to be enough for the acceleration of the blast crisis, which is supported by the finding of increased genomic instability as assayed by breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle formation. In light of these findings, the DNA damage-response pathway plays a vital role for determination of susceptibility to blast crisis in CML.","['Takagi, Masatoshi', 'Sato, Masaki', 'Piao, Jinhua', 'Miyamoto, Satoshi', 'Isoda, Takeshi', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu', 'Honda, Hiroaki', 'Mizutani, Shuki']","['Takagi M', 'Sato M', 'Piao J', 'Miyamoto S', 'Isoda T', 'Kitagawa M', 'Honda H', 'Mizutani S']","['Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Department of the Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan. m.takagi.ped@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130519,Netherlands,DNA Repair (Amst),DNA repair,101139138,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1568-7864(13)00103-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.dnarep.2013.04.022 [doi]']",ppublish,DNA Repair (Amst). 2013 Jul;12(7):500-7. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2013.04.022.

DESIGN: Population based, cohort, data linkage study in Australia. COHORT MEMBERS: 10.9 million people identified from Australian Medicare records, aged 0-19 years on 1 January 1985 or born between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 2005; all exposures to CT scans funded by Medicare during 1985-2005 were identified for this cohort. Cancers diagnosed in cohort members up to 31 December 2007 were obtained through linkage to national cancer records. MAIN OUTCOME: Cancer incidence rates in individuals exposed to a CT scan more than one year before any cancer diagnosis, compared with cancer incidence rates in unexposed individuals. RESULTS: 60,674 cancers were recorded, including 3150 in 680,211 people exposed to a CT scan at least one year before any cancer diagnosis. The mean duration of follow-up after exposure was 9.5 years. Overall cancer incidence was 24% greater for exposed than for unexposed people, after accounting for age, sex, and year of birth (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.24 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.29); P<0.001). We saw a dose-response relation, and the IRR increased by 0.16 (0.13 to 0.19) for each additional CT scan. The IRR was greater after exposure at younger ages (P<0.001 for trend). At 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15 or more years since first exposure, IRRs were 1.35 (1.25 to 1.45), 1.25 (1.17 to 1.34), 1.14 (1.06 to 1.22), and 1.24 (1.14 to 1.34), respectively. The IRR increased significantly for many types of solid cancer (digestive organs, melanoma, soft tissue, female genital, urinary tract, brain, and thyroid); leukaemia, myelodysplasia, and some other lymphoid cancers. There was an excess of 608 cancers in people exposed to CT scans (147 brain, 356 other solid, 48 leukaemia or myelodysplasia, and 57 other lymphoid). The absolute excess incidence rate for all cancers combined was 9.38 per 100,000 person years at risk, as of 31 December 2007. The average effective radiation dose per scan was estimated as 4.5 mSv. CONCLUSIONS: The increased incidence of cancer after CT scan exposure in this cohort was mostly due to irradiation. Because the cancer excess was still continuing at the end of follow-up, the eventual lifetime risk from CT scans cannot yet be determined. Radiation doses from contemporary CT scans are likely to be lower than those in 1985-2005, but some increase in cancer risk is still likely from current scans. Future CT scans should be limited to situations where there is a definite clinical indication, with every scan optimised to provide a diagnostic CT image at the lowest possible radiation dose.","['Mathews, John D', 'Forsythe, Anna V', 'Brady, Zoe', 'Butler, Martin W', 'Goergen, Stacy K', 'Byrnes, Graham B', 'Giles, Graham G', 'Wallace, Anthony B', 'Anderson, Philip R', 'Guiver, Tenniel A', 'McGale, Paul', 'Cain, Timothy M', 'Dowty, James G', 'Bickerstaffe, Adrian C', 'Darby, Sarah C']","['Mathews JD', 'Forsythe AV', 'Brady Z', 'Butler MW', 'Goergen SK', 'Byrnes GB', 'Giles GG', 'Wallace AB', 'Anderson PR', 'Guiver TA', 'McGale P', 'Cain TM', 'Dowty JG', 'Bickerstaffe AC', 'Darby SC']","['School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.']",['eng'],"['MC_U137686858/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130521,England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Sex Distribution', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC3660619,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/07/13 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1136/bmj.f2360 [doi]'],epublish,BMJ. 2013 May 21;346:f2360. doi: 10.1136/bmj.f2360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['BMJ. 2013;346:f3102.

Dex treatment promoted NFkB transcriptional activity leading to the up-regulation of c-Myc.

METHODS: We compared age, gender, splenomegaly, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, blood cell counts, blast counts in peripheral blood (PB) and BM, megakaryocyte counts, BM cellularity, dysplasia, and the karyotypes of patients with APMF (n = 6), AMKL-MF (n = 7), PMF (n = 44), and MDS-MF (n = 44). RESULTS: APMF showed hyperplasia of all three lineages, increase in megakaryocyte count with dysplasia and frequent abnormal karyotypes. AMKL-MF was associated with elevated BM blast counts, decreased BM megakaryocyte count with rare megakaryocytic dysplasia and chromosome 21 abnormality. PMF patients displayed splenomegaly, rare blasts in PB/BM, and JAK2 V617F mutation. MDS-MF patients showed pancytopenia, dysplasia in all three lineages and recurrent chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosome 5,7,12, and 17. CONCLUSIONS: Although differential diagnosis among APMF, AMKL-MF, PMF, and MDS-MF is very challenging due to the overlapping clinical and morphological features, meticulous investigation of the patient with respect to splenomegaly, blood cell count, PB and BM findings, and karyotype will serve as a guide to correct diagnosis.","['Bae, E', 'Park, C-J', 'Cho, Y-U', 'Seo, E-J', 'Chi, H-S', 'Jang, S', 'Lee, K-H', 'Lee, J-H', 'Lee, J-H', 'Suh, J-J', 'Im, H-J']","['Bae E', 'Park CJ', 'Cho YU', 'Seo EJ', 'Chi HS', 'Jang S', 'Lee KH', 'Lee JH', 'Lee JH', 'Suh JJ', 'Im HJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, VHS Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130522,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/blood/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/07/26 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12101 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2013 Dec;35(6):629-36. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12101.

Aerosolized ribavirin (RBV) is considered a cornerstone of treatment, but is expensive and has toxic side effects on patients and staff. In this study, RSV infection was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from routinely collected throat swabs in HSCT patients. Infected individuals were treated according to an institutional protocol using intravenous (IV) RBV for patients with LRTID and oral ribavirin for URTID. RESULTS: RSV infection was diagnosed in 10 patients (median age 60 years) a median of 15 days after allogeneic HSCT for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia. Five patients with LRTID received IV RBV within 7 days after HSCT, and 5 with URTID were treated with oral RBV 12-40 days after HSCT. One patient died of septic shock associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced pneumonia 28 days after HSCT in prolonged neutropenia. All patients became RSV PCR negative on throat swabs within a median of 22 days from start of RBV. Despite severe lymphopenia, no patient treated for URTID progressed to LRTID. Neutrophil recovery was delayed in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: We show that IV and oral RBV were efficacious in preventing progression and reducing mortality of RSV infection in this small series of allogeneic HSCT recipients. Randomized studies are not to be expected for this condition and therefore reporting case series could help in determining optimal RSV treatment.","['Gueller, S', 'Duenzinger, U', 'Wolf, T', 'Ajib, S', 'Mousset, S', 'Berger, A', 'Martin, H', 'Serve, H', 'Bug, G']","['Gueller S', 'Duenzinger U', 'Wolf T', 'Ajib S', 'Mousset S', 'Berger A', 'Martin H', 'Serve H', 'Bug G']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany. saskia.gueller@kgu.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130520,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,['49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharynx/virology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/*drug therapy/mortality/prevention & control/virology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human/*drug effects/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*drug therapy/mortality/prevention & control/virology', 'Ribavirin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12092 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2013 Aug;15(4):435-40. doi: 10.1111/tid.12092.

In the present study, we found accumulation of CD26(+) T cells in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) target organs. To expand our in vitro findings to an in vivo system, we examined CD26-dependent organ injury in a xenogeneic GVHD (x-GVHD) murine model. Following intraperitoneal injection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells into non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency/gamma(c) (-/-) mice (hu-PBL-NOG mice), the mice exhibited the onset of GVHD symptoms associated with the presence of CD26(high) human lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and GVHD target tissues. Administration of humanized anti-human CD26 monoclonal antibody (mAb) decreased x-GVHD severity and prolonged survival in hu-PBL-NOG mice without loss of engraftment of human T cells, while increasing doses of CTLA4- immunoglobulin fusion protein diminished engraftment of human lymphocytes. Importantly, anti-CD26 mAb treatment preserved the graft-versus-leukaemia effects in studies using cotransplantation of P815 murine leukaemic cells. In addition, CD26(+) lymphocytes infiltrated the GVHD patients' target tissues. Altogether, our data indicate a role for CD26 in the regulation of GVHD and point to CD26 as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in this disease.","['Hatano, Ryo', 'Ohnuma, Kei', 'Yamamoto, Junpei', 'Dang, Nam H', 'Yamada, Taketo', 'Morimoto, Chikao']","['Hatano R', 'Ohnuma K', 'Yamamoto J', 'Dang NH', 'Yamada T', 'Morimoto C']","['Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune disorders and Cancers, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130521,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12378 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Jul;162(2):263-77. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12378.

However, increasing evidence now suggests that total body irradiation treatment, specifically, is linked with future risk of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and dyslipidaemia, possibly because total body irradiation affects adipocyte differentiation and impairs subcutaneous adipose tissue depot expansion during times of positive energy balance. CASE REPORT: We describe a 20-year-old woman who developed pancreatitis with severe hypertriglyceridaemia (serum triglycerides > 300 mmol/l) that required plasmapheresis. She had received total body irradiation prior to her bone marrow transplant at age 6 years for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She developed ovarian failure at age 12 years. At age 15 years she was noted to have hyperglycaemia, increased blood pressure, hepatic steatosis and mild hypertriglyceridaemia. She presented with severe hypertriglyceridaemia and eruptive xanthoma, and developed pancreatitis 12 h after admission. She was treated with plasmapheresis and intravenous insulin and made an excellent recovery. We implicate and discuss total body irradiation as the major contributing factor to her severe hypertriglyceridaemia, compounded by worsening glycaemic control, oestrogen deficiency and a changing adult lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Children who have received total body irradiation are at risk of diabetes and an exaggerated form of the metabolic syndrome with hypertriglyceridaemia, which can be life-threatening. We suggest that survivors of total body irradiation treatment require careful lifelong monitoring of their metabolic status.","['Rajendran, R', 'Abu, E', 'Fadl, A', 'Byrne, C D']","['Rajendran R', 'Abu E', 'Fadl A', 'Byrne CD']","['Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Southampton General Hospital, University Hospitals of Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK. rajeshmarthar@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Diabet Med,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,8500858,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fatty Liver/*etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/*etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Metabolic Syndrome/diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease', 'Obesity, Abdominal/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Plasmapheresis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/etiology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Skin Diseases/etiology/prevention & control', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Xanthomatosis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/dme.12234 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabet Med. 2013 Aug;30(8):e239-42. doi: 10.1111/dme.12234.,['(c) 2013 The Authors.

Systemic management including respiratory and circulatory support is necessary. In addition, abdominal paracentesis is often needed for pain relief and to reduce the pressure of tense ascites. Concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART) involves the filtration, concentration, and reinfusion of drained ascites, which contributes to reuse of autologous proteins. CART has been reported as supportive therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis and cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the efficacy and safety of CART in three patients (two with acute myelogenous leukemia and one with chronic myeloid leukemia) who developed SOS after allo-HSCT. They all had symptomatic, tense, and diuretic-refractory ascites with right costal pain and marked weight gain. Two patients showed immediate improvement after CART. However, one patient experienced four CARTs with slow recovery. All patients are now alive and are being monitored as outpatients over 2 years with remission. No severe adverse event was observed related to CART, and 25.2-98.0 (median 30.2) grams of albumin was collected and reinfused. CART after paracentesis reduces protein loss in ascites by reinfusion of autologous protein instead of exogenous albumin preparations. Although transient fever is reported as a frequent adverse event, no events like severe bleeding or infection were observed. While its safety has not been fully established in patients with hematological disease after HSCT, CART may be a considerable supportive therapy for SOS with tense ascites.","['Takahashi, Hiroyuki', 'Sakai, Rika', 'Fujita, Atsuko', 'Kuwabara, Hideyuki', 'Hattori, Yukako', 'Matsuura, Shiro', 'Ohshima, Rika', 'Hagihara, Maki', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki', 'Fujisawa, Shin']","['Takahashi H', 'Sakai R', 'Fujita A', 'Kuwabara H', 'Hattori Y', 'Matsuura S', 'Ohshima R', 'Hagihara M', 'Tomita N', 'Ishigatsubo Y', 'Fujisawa S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130520,United States,Artif Organs,Artificial organs,7802778,,IM,"['Adult', 'Ascites/*etiology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Filtration/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/aor.12080 [doi]'],ppublish,Artif Organs. 2013 Oct;37(10):932-6. doi: 10.1111/aor.12080.

Both T-cell and NK-cell LGL leukemia can manifest as indolent or aggressive neoplasia. These rare lymphoproliferative disorders are often associated with autoimmune diseases and impaired hematopoiesis. Symptomatic patients are treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The co-association of T-LGLL with clonal B-cell disorders is reported in more than 10% of patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 57-yr-old white male patient with no history of autoimmune disorders, with refractory T-LGLL and myeloma who was treated with bortezomib and subsequently with lenalidomide. After 30 months of on-going lenalidomide therapy, the patient is in partial remission from myeloma and in continuous complete hematological remission from T-LGLL. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, this is the first report of a patient with refractory T-LGLL treated with bortezomib and lenalidomide. As refractory T-LGLL is a challenging condition, we think that lenalidomide and bortezomib deserve further investigation.","['Pelliccia, Sabrina', 'Di Napoli, Arianna', 'Naso, Virginia', 'Alma, Eleonora', 'Rebecchini, Caterina', 'Cox, Maria C']","['Pelliccia S', 'Di Napoli A', 'Naso V', 'Alma E', 'Rebecchini C', 'Cox MC']","[""Department of Hematology, AO Sant'Andrea, La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. sabrina.pelliccia@virgilio.it""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130628,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Boronic Acids/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pyrazines/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12141 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Aug;91(2):183-6. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12141.

Here, we report anti-cancer effects and molecular mechanisms of ethanolic extract of G. montanum (GLEt) on human leukaemia HL-60 cells, compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of GLEt (10-50 mug/ml) and cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay. Levels of lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 were measured. Further, apoptosis was studied using annexin-V staining and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: GLEt had a potent cytotoxic effect on HL-60 cells (IC50 -20 mug/ml), yet was not toxic to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Exposure of HL-60 cells to GLEt led to elevated levels of malonaldehyde formation, but to reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities (P < 0.05). Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by observing annexin-V positive cells, associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 was observed in GLEt-treated HL-60 cells, indicating its potential at inducing their apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the present study suggest that G. montanum induced apoptosis in the human leukaemic cancer cells, mediated by collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of intracellular antioxidant potential.","['Ramkumar, K M', 'Manjula, C', 'Elango, B', 'Krishnamurthi, K', 'Saravana Devi, S', 'Rajaguru, P']","['Ramkumar KM', 'Manjula C', 'Elango B', 'Krishnamurthi K', 'Saravana Devi S', 'Rajaguru P']","['SRM Research Institute, SRM University, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu 603 203, India. ramkumar.km@res.srmuniv.ac.in']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', '*Gymnema', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",PMC6496391,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/07/25 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cpr.12033 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2013 Jun;46(3):263-71. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12033.,['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, effects of hCLP46 overexpression, up to now, have remained unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we established stable 293TRex cell lines inducibly overexpressing hCLP46, and knocked down hCLP6 with a specific small interfering RNA to explore function of the protein in Notch signalling and cell proliferation. RESULTS: hCLP46 overexpression enhanced Notch1 activation in 293Trex cells in a ligand-dependent manner, with increased Notch signalling enhancing Hes1 expression. We further verified that overexpression of hCLP46 inhibited proliferation of 293TRexs and was correlated with increases in cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, whereas reduced hCLP46 expression moderately increased cell proliferation. In addition, p21 and p27 protein levels were higher when Notch signalling was activated by EDTA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, hCLP46 enhanced Notch activation and inhibited 293TRex cell proliferation through CDKI signalling.","['Chu, Q', 'Liu, L', 'Wang, W']","['Chu Q', 'Liu L', 'Wang W']","['College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing100049, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (POGLUT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Glucosyltransferases/*biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor HES-1']",PMC6495447,,2013/05/23 06:00,2013/07/25 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cpr.12037 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2013 Jun;46(3):254-62. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12037.,['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel technologies are now available with the ability to search for unknown viruses, such as gene arrays and new generation sequencing of tissue and other samples. In 2006, chip technology identified a novel retrovirus in human prostate cancer (PCa) tissue samples. Due to close homology to a mouse retrovirus, the virus was named xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV). Ever since the initial disease association with PCa, XMRV has stirred a lot of attention and concern worldwide for the medical community, public health officials and in particular global transfusion services. Public response, in this new era of electronic communication and advocacy was rapid, wide and unprecedented. In this review, we outline the course of biomedical research efforts that were put forward internationally in the process of determining the risk to the human population, the response of the blood banking community and review the current state of knowledge of xenotropic murine retroviruses. Although XMRV is no longer regarded as an infection of humans, a lesson was learnt in modern virology that holds deeper implications for biomedical research, particularly stem cell generation and transplantation practices.","['Kakisi, O K', 'Robinson, M J', 'Tettmar, K I', 'Tedder, R S']","['Kakisi OK', 'Robinson MJ', 'Tettmar KI', 'Tedder RS']","['Transfusion Microbiology Research and Development, National Transfusion Microbiology Laboratories, NHS Blood and Transplant, Colindale, London, UK. o.kakisi@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130521,England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,,IM,"['Animals', '*Biomedical Research', '*Blood Banks', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', '*Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus']",,,2013/05/23 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/05/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tme.12049 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfus Med. 2013 Jun;23(3):142-51. doi: 10.1111/tme.12049.

METHODS: The expression of DLK1 mRNA in the bone marrow cells of cases with MDS, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and normal control groups were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical significance. RESULTS: Significantly higher expression of DLK1 mRNA was observed in the bone marrow cells of MDS patients (0.7342+/-0.3652) compared with the normal control group (0.4801+/-0.1759) (P<0.05). The expression of DLK1 mRNA had a positive correlation with the proportion of bone marrow blasts (r=0.467, P<0.05). Moreover, DLK1 mRNA expression was significantly increased as MDS progressed (P<0.05). Patients with abnormal karyotypes exhibited significantly higher expression of DLK1 mRNA (0.9007+/-0.4334) than those with normal karyotypes (0.6411+/-0.2630) (P<0.05). Subsequently, patients with highly expressed DLK1 (>/=0.8) presented significantly higher malignant clone burden (0.4134+/-0.3999) than those with lower DLK1 expression (<0.8),(0.1517+/-0.3109), (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The DLK1 gene was highly expressed in MDS patients, and was increased as MDS progressed. The expression of DLK1 mRNA was positively correlated with the proportion of the bone marrow blasts. A high expression of DLK1 gene suggested a higher malignant clone burden of MDS.","['Yue, Lan-Zhu', 'Fu, Rong', 'Wang, Hua-Quan', 'Li, Li-Juan', 'Ruan, Er-Bao', 'Wang, Guo-Jin', 'Qu, Wen', 'Liang, Yong', 'Guan, Jing', 'Wu, Yu-Hong', 'Liu, Hong', 'Song, Jia', 'Wang, Xiao-Ming', 'Xing, Li-Min', 'Shao, Zong-Hong']","['Yue LZ', 'Fu R', 'Wang HQ', 'Li LJ', 'Ruan EB', 'Wang GJ', 'Qu W', 'Liang Y', 'Guan J', 'Wu YH', 'Liu H', 'Song J', 'Wang XM', 'Xing LM', 'Shao ZH']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Cancer Biol Med,Cancer biology & medicine,101588850,,,,PMC3643669,,2013/05/22 06:00,2013/05/22 06:01,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7497/j.issn.2095-3941.2012.03.006 [doi]', 'cbm-09-03-188 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Med. 2012 Sep;9(3):188-91. doi: 10.7497/j.issn.2095-3941.2012.03.006.,,['NOTNLM'],"['DLK1 gene', 'expression', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The level of expressed PRAME mRNA in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 34 patients with acute leukemia (AL) and in 12 bone marrow samples from healthy volunteers was measured via RT-PCR. Correlation analyses between PRAME gene expression and the clinical characteristics (gender, age, white blood count, immunophenotype of leukemia, percentage of blast cells, and karyotype) of the patients were performed. RESULTS: The PRAME gene was expressed in 38.2% of all 34 patients, in 40.7% of the patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, n=27), and in 28.6% of the patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=7), but was not expressed in the healthy volunteers. The difference in the expression levels between AML and ALL patients was statistically significant. The rate of gene expression was 80% in M3, 33.3% in M2, and 28.6% in M5. Gene expression was also found to be correlated with CD15 and CD33 expression and abnormal karyotype, but not with age, gender, white blood count or percentage of blast cells. CONCLUSIONS: The PRAME gene is highly expressed in acute leukemia and could be a useful marker to monitor minimal residual disease. This gene is also a candidate target for the immunotherapy of acute leukemia.","['Ding, Kai', 'Wang, Xiao-Ming', 'Fu, Rong', 'Ruan, Er-Bao', 'Liu, Hui', 'Shao, Zong-Hong']","['Ding K', 'Wang XM', 'Fu R', 'Ruan EB', 'Liu H', 'Shao ZH']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Cancer Biol Med,Cancer biology & medicine,101588850,,,,PMC3643640,,2012/03/01 00:00,2012/03/01 00:01,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3969/j.issn.2095-3941.2012.01.013 [doi]', 'cbm-09-01-073 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Med. 2012 Mar;9(1):73-6. doi: 10.3969/j.issn.2095-3941.2012.01.013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'gene', 'immunotherapy', 'minimal residual disease', 'preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, these aberrations have clinical and biological significance. T(3;12)(q26;p13), which is a recurrent chromosomal aberration observed in myeloid malignancies, is typically associated with dysplasia of megakaryocytes, multilineage involvement, short duration of any blastic phase, and extremely poor prognosis. We have identified a recurrent reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 3 and 12 with different breakpoint at bands 3q21 in the malignant cells from a 28-year-old man.

We confirmed the t(3;12)(q21;p13) translocation via fluorescence in situ hybridization assay by using whole-chromosome paint probes for chromosomes 3 and 12. Our findings demonstrate that, similar to other recurrent translocations involving 3q26 such as t(3;3) and t(3;21), the t(3;12)(q21;p13) translocation is implicated not only in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia but also in the progression of CML.

Their identification and quantification remain crucial for the patients' residual disease monitoring. We investigated a new method that could represent a novel reliable alternative to sequencing for its identification. This method was based on high-resolution melting analysis in order to detect mutated patients and on an allele-specific oligonucleotide real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ASO-RQ-PCR) for the identification and quantification of the transcripts carrying NPM1 mutations (NPM1m). Few patients carrying known NPM1m enabled us to set up a table with the different primers' DeltaCT values, identifying a profile for each mutation type. We then analysed a series of 337 AML patients' samples for NPM1 mutational status characterization and confirmed the ASO-RQ-PCR results by direct sequencing.

Previous reports have shown that Htt is essential for embryogenesis, and a recent study by our group revealed that the pathogenic form of Htt (mHtt) causes impairments in multiple stages of striatal development. In this study, we have examined whether HD-associated striatal developmental deficits are reflective of earlier maturational alterations occurring at the time of neurulation by assessing differential roles of Htt and mHtt during neural induction and early neurogenesis using an in vitro mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) clonal assay system. We demonstrated that the loss of Htt in ESCs (KO ESCs) severely disrupts the specification of primitive and definitive neural stem cells (pNSCs, dNSCs, respectively) during the process of neural induction. In addition, clonally derived KO pNSCs and dNSCs displayed impaired proliferative potential, enhanced cell death and altered multi-lineage potential. Conversely, as observed in HD knock-in ESCs (Q111 ESCs), mHtt enhanced the number and size of pNSC clones, which exhibited enhanced proliferative potential and precocious neuronal differentiation. The transition from Q111 pNSCs to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-responsive dNSCs was marked by potentiation in the number of dNSCs and altered proliferative potential. The multi-lineage potential of Q111 dNSCs was also enhanced with precocious neurogenesis and oligodendrocyte progenitor elaboration. The generation of Q111 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-responsive dNSCs was also compromised, whereas their multi-lineage potential was unaltered. These abnormalities in neural induction were associated with differential alterations in the expression profiles of Notch, Hes1 and Hes5. These cumulative observations indicate that Htt is required for multiple stages of neural induction, whereas mHtt enhances this process and promotes precocious neurogenesis and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell elaboration.","['Nguyen, Giang D', 'Gokhan, Solen', 'Molero, Aldrin E', 'Mehler, Mark F']","['Nguyen GD', 'Gokhan S', 'Molero AE', 'Mehler MF']","['Roslyn and Leslie Goldstein Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS071571/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS071571/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH066290/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS073758/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH66290/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'HD071593/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 HD071593/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130514,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Htt protein, mouse)', '0 (Huntingtin Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Ectoderm/cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endoderm/cytology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Huntingtin Protein', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neural Plate/cytology/drug effects/*embryology', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurogenesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC3653864,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0064368 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-08513 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 14;8(5):e64368. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064368.

Using RNA interference, we show that nucleosome assembly proteins NAP1 and TAF-I positively contribute to EBV reactivation in epithelial cells through the induction of BZLF1 expression. In addition, overexpression of NAP1 or the beta isoform of TAF-I (TAF-Ibeta) in AGS cells latently infected with EBV was sufficient to induce BZLF1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments performed in AGS-EBV cells showed that TAF-I associated with the BZLF1 promoter upon lytic induction and affected local histone modifications by increasing H3K4 dimethylation and H4K8 acetylation. MLL1, the host protein known to dimethylate H3K4, was found to associate with the BZLF1 promoter upon lytic induction in a TAF-I-dependent manner, and MLL1 depletion decreased BZLF1 expression, confirming its contribution to lytic reactivation.

CT-1 has been shown to induce these effects via binding to a transmembrane receptor, comprising the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR beta ) subunit and the glycoprotein 130 (gp130, a common signal transducer). Both local and systemic concentrations of CT-1 have been shown to potentially play a critical role in obesity. For instance, CT-1 plasma concentrations have been shown to be increased in metabolic syndrome (a cluster disease including obesity) probably due to adipose tissue overexpression. Interestingly, treatment with exogenous CT-1 has been shown to improve lipid and glucose metabolism in animal models of obesity. These benefits might suggest a potential therapeutic role for CT-1. However, beyond its beneficial properties, CT-1 has been also shown to induce some adverse effects, such as cardiac hypertrophy and adipose tissue inflammation. Although scientific evidence is still needed, CT-1 might be considered as a potential example of damage/danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in obesity-related cardiovascular diseases.

We determined whether a novel bispecific killer cell engager (BiKE) signaling through CD16 and targeting CD33 could activate NK cells at high potency against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) targets. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the ability of our fully humanized CD16 x CD33 (CD16 x 33) BiKE to trigger in vitro NK cell activation against HL60 (CD33(+)), RAJI (CD33(-)), and primary AML targets (de novo and refractory) to determine whether treatment with CD16 x 33 BiKE in combination with an ADAM17 inhibitor could prevent CD16 shedding (a novel inhibitory mechanism induced by NK cell activation) and overcome inhibition of class I MHC recognizing inhibitory receptors. RESULTS: NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine release were specifically triggered by the CD16 x 33 BiKE when cells were cultured with HL60 targets, CD33(+) de novo and refractory AML targets. Combination treatment with CD16 x 33 BiKE and ADAM17 inhibitor resulted in inhibition of CD16 shedding in NK cells, and enhanced NK cell activation. Treatment of NK cells from double umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) recipients with the CD16 x 33 BiKE resulted in activation, especially in those recipients with cytomegalovirus reactivation. CONCLUSION: CD16 x 33 BiKE can overcome self-inhibitory signals and effectively elicit NK cell effector activity against AML. These in vitro studies highlight the potential of CD16 x 33 BiKE +/- ADAM17 inhibition to enhance NK cell activation and specificity against CD33(+) AML, which optimally could be applied in patients with relapsed AML or for adjuvant antileukemic therapy posttransplantation.","['Wiernik, Andres', 'Foley, Bree', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Warlick, Erica', 'Gleason, Michelle K', 'Ross, Julie A', 'Luo, Xianghua', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Walcheck, Bruce', 'Vallera, Daniel A', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Wiernik A', 'Foley B', 'Zhang B', 'Verneris MR', 'Warlick E', 'Gleason MK', 'Ross JA', 'Luo X', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Walcheck B', 'Vallera DA', 'Miller JS']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 CA157439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA111412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142714/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI100879/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (INCB3619)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cytomegalovirus/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*metabolism', 'Spiro Compounds/pharmacology', 'Virus Activation']",PMC3715574,['NIHMS483553'],2013/05/22 06:00,2014/02/06 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-0505 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0505 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jul 15;19(14):3844-55. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0505.

We developed and validated a prognostic score for overall survival (OS) based on mutational status and standard clinical variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped ASXL1 and up to 18 other genes including epigenetic (TET2, EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A), splicing (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSF2, U2AF1), transcription (RUNX1, NPM1, TP53), and signaling (NRAS, KRAS, CBL, JAK2, FLT3) regulators in 312 patients with CMML. Genotypes and clinical variables were included in a multivariable Cox model of OS validated by bootstrapping. A scoring system was developed using regression coefficients from this model. RESULTS: ASXL1 mutations (P < .0001) and, to a lesser extent, SRSF2 (P = .03), CBL (P = .003), and IDH2 (P = .03) mutations predicted inferior OS in univariable analysis. The retained independent prognostic factors included ASXL1 mutations, age older than 65 years, WBC count greater than 15 x10(9)/L, platelet count less than 100 x10(9)/L, and anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in female patients, < 11g/dL in male patients). The resulting five-parameter prognostic score delineated three groups of patients with median OS not reached, 38.5 months, and 14.4 months, respectively (P < .0001), and was validated in an independent cohort of 165 patients (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: A new prognostic score including ASXL1 status, age, hemoglobin, WBC, and platelet counts defines three groups of CMML patients with distinct outcomes. Based on concordance analysis, this score appears more discriminative than those based solely on clinical parameters.","['Itzykson, Raphael', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Morabito, Margot', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Droin, Nathalie', 'Solary, Eric']","['Itzykson R', 'Kosmider O', 'Renneville A', 'Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Morabito M', 'Berthon C', 'Ades L', 'Fenaux P', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Vey N', 'Braun T', 'Haferlach T', 'Dreyfus F', 'Cross NC', 'Preudhomme C', 'Bernard OA', 'Fontenay M', 'Vainchenker W', 'Schnittger S', 'Birnbaum D', 'Droin N', 'Solary E']","['Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20130520,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Splicing/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2013/08/30 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.47.3314 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.47.3314 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jul 1;31(19):2428-36. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.47.3314.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on risk factors and outcomes of 642 children with SMNs occurring after treatment for ALL from 18 collaborative study groups between 1980 and 2007. RESULTS: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 186), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 69), and nonmeningioma brain tumor (n = 116) were the most common types of SMNs and had the poorest outcome (5-year survival rate, 18.1% +/- 2.9%, 31.1% +/- 6.2%, and 18.3% +/- 3.8%, respectively). Five-year survival estimates for AML were 11.2% +/- 2.9% for 125 patients diagnosed before 2000 and 34.1% +/- 6.3% for 61 patients diagnosed after 2000 (P < .001); 5-year survival estimates for MDS were 17.1% +/- 6.4% (n = 36) and 48.2% +/- 10.6% (n = 33; P = .005). Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation failed to improve outcome of secondary myeloid malignancies after adjusting for waiting time to transplantation. Five-year survival rates were above 90% for patients with meningioma, Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and parotid gland tumor, and 68.5% +/- 6.4% for those with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighty-nine percent of patients with brain tumors had received cranial irradiation. Solid tumors were associated with cyclophosphamide exposure, and myeloid malignancy was associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors and starting doses of methotrexate of at least 25 mg/m(2) per week and mercaptopurine of at least 75 mg/m(2) per day. Myeloid malignancies with monosomy 7/5q- were associated with high hyperdiploid ALL karyotypes, whereas 11q23/MLL-rearranged AML or MDS was associated with ALL harboring translocations of t(9;22), t(4;11), t(1;19), and t(12;21) (P = .03). CONCLUSION: SMNs, except for brain tumors, AML, and MDS, have outcomes similar to their primary counterparts.","['Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Levinsen, Mette Frandsen', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Gibson, Brenda', 'Heydrich, Christiane', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Ishida, Yasushi', 'Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Piette, Caroline', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Silverman, Lewis', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Stark, Batia', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Levinsen MF', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Baruchel A', 'Devidas M', 'Escherich G', 'Gibson B', 'Heydrich C', 'Horibe K', 'Ishida Y', 'Liang DC', 'Locatelli F', 'Michel G', 'Pieters R', 'Piette C', 'Pui CH', 'Raimondi S', 'Silverman L', 'Stanulla M', 'Stark B', 'Winick N', 'Valsecchi MG']","['Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. kschmiegelow@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",PMC3807139,,2013/05/22 06:00,2013/08/30 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.47.0500 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.47.0500 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jul 1;31(19):2469-76. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.47.0500.

We first described the NOTCH1 PEST domain mutation in a CLL subgroup, but the activation of the NOTCH pathway in NOTCH1-unmutated cases remains unexplained. Here, we investigated whether genetic lesions in the NF-kappaB/NOTCH loop might support the NOTCH activation status by sequencing negative (TNFAIP3/A20) and positive (TRAF2, TRAF5, TNFRSF11A/RANK, MAP3K7/TAK1, and CARD11) regulators of NF-kappaB together with NF-kappaB targets on the NOTCH pathway, the NOTCH ligands Jagged1 and Jagged2, in CLL patients. The sequence analysis revealed four missense mutations for A20, TRAF2, TRAF5 and RANK1 genes, all causing a change in amino acid group from polar to non-polar, but functional domains were not involved. Specific predictive software analyses confirmed that the amino acid changes have a low-functional impact on the protein. Our results show that in CLL, NF-kappaB regulators and Jagged are both unmutated, suggesting that the Jagged-mediated interplay between NF-kappaB and NOTCH is independent of genetic lesions.","['Baldoni, Stefano', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Del Papa, Beatrice', 'Aureli, Patrizia', 'Dorillo, Erica', 'Rosati, Emanuela', 'Ciurnelli, Raffaella', 'Marconi, Pierfrancesco', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Di Ianni, Mauro']","['Baldoni S', 'Sportoletti P', 'Del Papa B', 'Aureli P', 'Dorillo E', 'Rosati E', 'Ciurnelli R', 'Marconi P', 'Falzetti F', 'Di Ianni M']","['Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130521,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation, Missense', '*NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/06/19 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1368-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Aug;98(2):153-7. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1368-y.

Bone marrow transplantation remains the standard of care for younger patients and those with a good performance status but many patients may not have a suitable donor. Immunosuppressive therapy is able to resolve cytopenias in a majority of patients with aplastic anemia but relapses are not uncommon and some patients remain refractory to this approach. Patients may require frequent blood and platelet transfusion support which is expensive and inconvenient. Life-threatening bleeding complications still occur despite prophylactic platelet transfusion. Thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag, were developed to treat patients with refractory immune thrombocytopenia but are now being investigated for the treatment of bone marrow failure syndromes. TPO is the main regulator for platelet production and its receptor (c-Mpl) is present on megakaryocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. Trilineage hematopoietic responses were observed in a recent clinical trial using eltrombopag in patients with severe aplastic anemia refractory to immunosuppression suggesting that these agents can provide a new therapeutic option for enhancing blood production. In this review, we discuss these recent results and ongoing investigation of TPO mimetics for aplastic anemia and other bone marrow failure states like myelodysplastic syndromes. Clonal evolution or progression to acute myeloid leukemia remains a concern when using these drugs in bone marrow failure and patients should only be treated in the setting of a clinical trial.","['Townsley, Danielle M', 'Desmond, Ronan', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Young, Neal S']","['Townsley DM', 'Desmond R', 'Dunbar CE', 'Young NS']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Dr, CRC 3-5140, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. townsleydm@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],['ZIA HL002315-31/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130521,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Hematologic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'Bone Marrow failure syndromes']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology/therapy', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Hematologic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*agonists/metabolism', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Thrombopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Thrombopoietin/*agonists/metabolism']",PMC4144663,['NIHMS619438'],2013/05/22 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1352-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Jul;98(1):48-55. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1352-6.

Therapeutic options for unresectable PDAC are extremely limited and there is a pressing need for expanded therapeutic approaches to improve current options available with gemcitabine-based regimens. With PDAC displaying one of the most prominent desmoplastic stromal reactions of all carcinomas, recent research has focused on the microenvironment surrounding PDAC cells. Secreted protein acid and rich in cysteine (SPARC), which is overexpressed in PDAC, may display tumor suppressor functions in several cancers (e.g., in colorectal, ovarian, prostate cancers, and acute myelogenous leukemia) but also appears to be overexpressed in other tumor types (e.g., breast cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma). The apparent contradictory functions of SPARC may yield inhibition of angiogenesis via inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, while promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasion through matrix metalloprotease expression.

However, some patients with CLL will have more aggressive disease progression, and identifying that subgroup may be important for early, or perhaps more aggressive, intervention. In addition, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis is often found on routine laboratory evaluation, and it is important to distinguish this entity from overt CLL. Moreover, since many patients with CLL are discovered incidentally and before significant disease progression, prognostic laboratory evaluation may become increasingly efficacious as therapeutic options replace the older strategy of expectant observation. Prognostication may be especially critical if it correctly identifies patients with early stage CLL who are at high risk of clonal evolution and/ or resistance to chemoimmunotherapy. Laboratory studies include surface CD38 and intracellular ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometry, serum beta2-microglobulin, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene mutational status. Cytogenetics for targeted chromosome alterations may similarly aid in predicting outcome and guiding early intervention. This article concisely reviews the utility of commonly performed prognostic markers and addresses the laboratory evaluation in patients with incidentally discovered early stage CLL.","['Siddon, Alexa J', 'Rinder, Henry M']","['Siddon AJ', 'Rinder HM']","['Dept of Laboratory Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8035, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Incidental Findings', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Watchful Waiting', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['139/6/708 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPLIR4GZWX3XKA [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2013 Jun;139(6):708-12. doi: 10.1309/AJCPLIR4GZWX3XKA.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD38', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'IGHV somatic hypermutation', 'Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival', 'TP53 mutation', 'ZAP-70']",,,,,,,,,,['Am J Clin Pathol. 2013 Aug;140(2):280'],,,,"['Education Committee of the Academy of Clinical Laboratory Physicians and', 'Scientists']",,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of CLL cell death induced as a consequence of VSV infection in the presence of BCL-2 inhibitors, obatoclax, and ABT-737 in primary ex vivo CLL patient samples. Microarray analysis of primary CD19(+) CD5(+) CLL cells treated with obatoclax and VSV revealed changes in expression of genes regulating apoptosis, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and cellular metabolism. A combined therapeutic effect was observed for VSV and BCL-2 inhibitors in cells from untreated patients and from patients unresponsive to standard of care therapy. In addition, combination treatment induced several markers of autophagy--LC3-II accumulation, p62 degradation, and staining of autophagic vacuoles. Inhibition of early stage autophagy using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) led to increased apoptosis in CLL samples. Mechanistically, a combination of BCL-2 inhibitors and VSV disrupted inhibitory interactions of Beclin-1 with BCL-2 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), thus biasing cells toward autophagy. We propose a mechanism in which changes in cellular metabolism, coupled with pharmacologic disruption of the BCL-2-Beclin-1 interactions, facilitate induction of apoptosis and autophagy to mediate the cytolytic effect of VSV.","['Samuel, Sara', 'Beljanski, Vladimir', 'Van Grevenynghe, Julien', 'Richards, Stephanie', 'Ben Yebdri, Fethia', 'He, Zhong', 'Nichols, Carmen', 'Belgnaoui, S Mehdi', 'Steel, Courtney', 'Goulet, Marie-Line', 'Shamy, April', 'Brown, Dawn', 'Abesada, Guillermo', 'Haddad, Elias K', 'Hiscott, John']","['Samuel S', 'Beljanski V', 'Van Grevenynghe J', 'Richards S', 'Ben Yebdri F', 'He Z', 'Nichols C', 'Belgnaoui SM', 'Steel C', 'Goulet ML', 'Shamy A', 'Brown D', 'Abesada G', 'Haddad EK', 'Hiscott J']","['Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['R21 CA192185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MOP 42562/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130521,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Oncolytic Viruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*genetics/physiology']",PMC3702114,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)31965-7 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2013.91 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2013 Jul;21(7):1413-23. doi: 10.1038/mt.2013.91.

We previously reported sustained calcineurin (Cn) activation in human lymphoid malignancies, and showed that Cn inhibitors have antileukemic effects in mouse models of T-ALL. It was unclear, however, from these studies whether these effects resulted from Cn inhibition in leukemic cells themselves or were an indirect consequence of impaired Cn function in the supportive tumor microenvironment. We thus generated a Notch (intracellular Notch 1, ICN1)-induced T-ALL mouse model, in which conditional Cn genetic deletion is restricted to leukemic cells. Ex vivo, Cn deletion altered the adhesive interactions between leukemic cells and their supportive stroma, leukemic cell survival, proliferation, migration and clonogenic potential. In vivo, Cn activation was found to be critical for leukemia initiating/propagating cell activity as demonstrated by the failure of Cn-deficient leukemic cells to transplant the disease to syngeneic recipient mice. Importantly, combination of vincristine treatment with Cre-mediated Cn ablation cooperated to induce long-term remission of ICN1-induced T-ALL. These findings indicate that Cn is a promising target in T-ALL relapse prevention, and call for clinical trials incorporating Cn inhibitors during consolidation therapy.","['Gachet, S', 'Genesca, E', 'Passaro, D', 'Irigoyen, M', 'Alcalde, H', 'Clemenson, C', 'Poglio, S', 'Pflumio, F', 'Janin, A', 'Lasgi, C', 'Dodier, S', 'Soyer, M', 'Dumenil, G', 'Ghysdael, J']","['Gachet S', 'Genesca E', 'Passaro D', 'Irigoyen M', 'Alcalde H', 'Clemenson C', 'Poglio S', 'Pflumio F', 'Janin A', 'Lasgi C', 'Dodier S', 'Soyer M', 'Dumenil G', 'Ghysdael J']","['1] Institut Curie, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France [2] Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 3306, Orsay, France [3] Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U1005, Orsay, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130521,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcineurin/*physiology', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013156 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.156 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Dec;27(12):2289-300. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.156.

Here, we demonstrate that STAT3 activation mostly results from constitutive Janus kinase (JAK)3 phosphorylation on tyrosine 980, as observed in three of the four tested NKCL cell lines and in 20 of the 23 NKCL tumor samples under study. In one of the cell lines and in 4 of 19 (21%) NKCL primary tumor samples, constitutive JAK3 activation was related to an acquired mutation (A573V or V722I) in the JAK3 pseudokinase domain. We then show that constitutive activation of the JAK3/STAT3 pathway has a major role in NKCL cell growth and survival and in the invasive phenotype. Indeed, NKCL cell growth was slowed down in vitro by targeting JAK3 with chemical inhibitors or small-interfering RNAs. In a human NKCL xenograft mouse model, tumor growth was significantly delayed by the JAK3 inhibitor CP-690550. Altogether, the constitutive activation of JAK3, which can result from JAK3-activating mutations, is a frequent feature of NKCL that deserves to be tested as a therapeutic target.","['Bouchekioua, A', 'Scourzic, L', 'de Wever, O', 'Zhang, Y', 'Cervera, P', 'Aline-Fardin, A', 'Mercher, T', 'Gaulard, P', 'Nyga, R', 'Jeziorowska, D', 'Douay, L', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Louache, F', 'Gespach, C', 'Solary, E', 'Coppo, P']","['Bouchekioua A', 'Scourzic L', 'de Wever O', 'Zhang Y', 'Cervera P', 'Aline-Fardin A', 'Mercher T', 'Gaulard P', 'Nyga R', 'Jeziorowska D', 'Douay L', 'Vainchenker W', 'Louache F', 'Gespach C', 'Solary E', 'Coppo P']","[""1] Unite Inserm U1009 'Hematopoiese normale et pathologique';

This cross-sectional study was conducted on160 patients using random samples selection, and included 80 men and 80 women (mean age, 59.1 &plusmn; 14.7 years). All the samples were screened for HTLV1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and positive samples were confirmed by Western blot assay. Only 1 patient had a positive anti-HTLV1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, which was confirmed by Western blot. The overall prevalence of HTLV1 seropositivity was 0.6%. The patient was a 21-year-old woman with a history of multiple blood transfusions. She had a history of unsuccessful kidney transplantation and had been on hemodialysis before transplant, too.

Rapid engraftment of donor lymphocyte elements can contribute to MRD control, but it remains unclear whether this strategy will benefit patients. In this study, we report the incidence of MRD eradication and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in persons with rapid versus later donor T lymphocyte engraftment after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allotransplantation. Twenty-seven subjects received lymphodepleting chemotherapy to facilitate donor engraftment followed by fludarabine and cyclophosphamide RIC and a blood cell allograft. MRD was monitored by multicolor flow cytometry after transplantation. Complete donor T lymphoid chimerism (TLC) and myeloid chimerism (MC) were achieved in 25 subjects at a median of 28 days (range, 14-60 days) and 21 days (range, 14-180 days), respectively. Achieving complete donor TLC by day 14 versus day 28 or later correlated with occurrence of grade 2 or higher acute GvHD (90% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 78-100%] versus 35% [95% CI, 16-54%]; p = 0.014) and better control of MRD in the bone marrow at day 100, median 0% (range, 0-0.1%) versus 8.5% (range, 0-92%; p = 0.016). Among 11 persons with early donor TLC, none had progressive disease, and seven died of treatment -related mortality (TRM). In persons with later development of TLC, 8 of 16 had progressive disease and 2 died of TRM. Time to donor myeloid chimerism had no effect on outcomes. Rapid establishment of donor TLC resulted in more complete eradication of early MRD, but greater incidence of acute GvHD and TRM in persons with CLL undergoing RIC allotransplantation.","['Shaffer, Brian C', 'Modric, Marko', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Steinberg, Seth M', 'Liewehr, David J', 'Fowler, Daniel H', 'Gale, Robert P', 'Bishop, Michael R', 'Pavletic, Steven Z']","['Shaffer BC', 'Modric M', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Arthur DC', 'Steinberg SM', 'Liewehr DJ', 'Fowler DH', 'Gale RP', 'Bishop MR', 'Pavletic SZ']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. shafferbc@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130518,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality/therapy', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3769491,['NIHMS482196'],2013/05/22 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00219-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.04.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Sep;41(9):772-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.04.015.

METHODS: One 13 years-old child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and negative HIV test who developed KS restricted in right conjunctiva, cornea and sclera after successful allogeneic PBSCT was reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The child suffered from T cell type ALL. He received immunosuppressive treatment after PBSCT, and had once extensive herpes zoster restricted in skin. Seven months after PBSCT, he had blurred vision with right eye and slowly neoplasm formed in cornea and conjunctiva. Pathological examination confirmed KS with changes like capillary hemangioma, atypical fusiform cell, typical immunochemistry and positive immunofluorescent result of HHV8. He received excision of lump of cornea, conjunctiva, sclera and transplantation of cornea and sclera. Antiviral therapy was given together with anti-infection, prevention of cornea rejection and biotherapy. He kept right eye and hand-move eyesight, survived without GVHD or recurrence of ALL and KS. CONCLUSION: This was the first ocular KS case in ALL child after PBSCT, without correlation with HIV infection. Complete excision combined with biotherapy was safe and effective for single ocular lesions.","['Guo, Hai-xia', 'Huang, Ke', 'Zhou, Dun-hua', 'Wang, Lin', 'Xiao, Jian-hui', 'Weng, Wen-jun', 'Fang, Jian-pei']","['Guo HX', 'Huang K', 'Zhou DH', 'Wang L', 'Xiao JH', 'Weng WJ', 'Fang JP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510120, China.']",['chi'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Eye Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', '*Sarcoma, Kaposi']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.015 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 May;34(5):445-8. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Serum proteins of 51 acute leukemia (AL) patients and 10 healthy donors were extracted from their peripheral blood. After removing high abundance protein, serum low abundance proteins were separated by two dimensional gel electrophoresis, the differences of serum proteins in AL patients and healthy human were identified. The protein spots with differential expression were cut out and then undergone bleaching, gel digestion and peptide extraction. The peptide mass fingerprint analysis was performed by using MALDI TOF/TOF MS. The protein database MSDB Masort retrieval program was used to evaluate the results. RESULTS: Using Student's t test,19 statistically significant abnormal expression proteins in the serum of AL patients were found compared with the healthy controls (P < 0.05). The expression of alpha1-trypsin inhibitor (P < 0.01), prealbumin (P < 0.01), trypsin inhibitor (P < 0.01), apolipoprotein E (P < 0.01) and apolipoprotein A- (P < 0.01) decreased, while retinol binding protein (P < 0.05), globin HP2 (P < 0.05), serum lectin (P < 0.05), H factor homologue protein (P < 0.05) and serum amyloid A1 (P < 0.01) increased. Further stratified analysis found that high serum lectin expression in AL patient resulted in poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: There are a variety of serum proteins with differential expression in peripheral blood of AL patients. The differential expression of serum lectin is related to the therapeutic effect. The differential expression of these proteins can be used as a new diagnosis marker or prognostic indicator for acute leukemia.","['Zheng, Rui-ji', 'Ma, Xu-dong']","['Zheng RJ', 'Ma XD']","['Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou 363000, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 May;34(5):426-9. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) cell line Kasumi-1 cells were treated with As(2)O(3) or in combination with TAK1 siRNA interference technology. The experiment was divided into four groups: Kasumi-1 cells without any treatment, TAK1 specific siRNA transfection alone, Kasumi-1 cells treated with different concentration of As(2)O(3), TAK1siRNA transfection combined with As(2)O(3). CCK-8 was used to detect the cell viability. The expression of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (P-JNK) was determined by Western Blot. Cell apoptosis and growth were examined by morphological and colony formation assay. RESULTS: After Kasumi-1 cells were treated with As(2)O(3), the rate of cell inhibition was concentration-dependent, and the 50% inhibitory concentration was 3.5 mumol/L. The highest expression level of P-JNK appeared in 30 minutes after cells were treated with As(2)O(3). The apoptosis rates of Kasumi-1 cells without any treatment, TAK1 siRNA interference alone group, As(2)O(3) alone group and the combined group were (5.02 +/- 1.13)%, (6.18 +/- 0.28)%, (48.33 +/- 2.70)% and (86.07 +/- 2.21)%; colony formation rates were (73.83 +/- 2.78)%, (76.03 +/- 1.46)%, (55.07 +/- 1.50)% and (22.20 +/- 1.15)%; apoptosis rate of TAK1 siRNA group and the untreated group has no significant difference (P = 0.052); colony formation rate between TAk1 siRNA group and the untreated group has no significant difference (P = 0.179), but the difference in other groups was significant (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Silencing the expression of TAK1 can enhance the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of As(2)O(3) on Kasumi-1 cells, and its mechanism may be through the TAK1 downstream JNK signal pathway.","['Xu, Jin-xia', 'Fan, Rui-hua', 'Wei, Xu-dong', 'Yin, Qing-song', 'Mi, Rui-hua', 'Song, Yong-ping']","['Xu JX', 'Fan RH', 'Wei XD', 'Yin QS', 'Mi RH', 'Song YP']","['Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 7)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 May;34(5):417-20. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 214 CML patients received imatinib were analyzed respectively in our hospital from April 2005 to December 2010. The therapy history and efficacy of regular follow-up and factors influencing drug resistance were analyzed. COX regression analysis was used to perform the univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Until the end of follow up, thirty-one patients (14.5%) occurred drug resistance. One of them was in accelerated phase(AP), and two in blast phase(BP); 69.2% of patients achieved a complete cytogenetic response(CCyR), and 31.3% of patients achieved a major molecular response(MMR). COX analysis was performed in 207 chronic phase(CP) patients. Univariate analysis showed that the course of disease before treatment, the hemoglobin count, the white blood cell count, whether achieved CCyR or not and whether achieved MMR or not were the influencing factors for imatinib resistance. Multivariate analysis showed that whether achieved CCyR or not was the independent factor for drug resistance. CONCLUSION: Whether achieved CCyR or not is an independent factor and also a protective factor for imatinib resistance in patients with CML.","['Zhou, Min', 'Qiu, Hui-ying', 'He, Guang-sheng', 'Xu, Yang', 'Cen, Jian-nong', 'Pan, Jin-lan', 'Chen, Su-ning', 'Sun, Ai-ning', 'Zhang, Ri', 'Wu, De-pei']","['Zhou M', 'Qiu HY', 'He GS', 'Xu Y', 'Cen JN', 'Pan JL', 'Chen SN', 'Sun AN', 'Zhang R', 'Wu DP']","['First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Soochow 215006, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 May;34(5):395-8. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 129 cases of de novo childhood (73 cases) and adult (56 cases) B-ALL were examined genetically and immunologically using G-banding techniqhe, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, and their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of 73 childhood cases, the prevalences of homozygous deletion, hemizygous deletion and no deletion of p16 were 24.7% (18 cases), 6.8% (5 cases) and 68.5% (50 cases) respectively, and of 56 adult cases, the incidences as of 14.3% (8 cases), 8.9% (5 cases) and 76.8% (43 cases) respectively. The incidence of p16 deletion between the two groups had no significant difference (P = 0.338). In both groups, patients with or without p16 deletion had no significant difference in terms of white blood cells (WBC) count at diagnosis, BM blast percentage, chromosome karyotype, extra-infiltration and CR1 rate. Of note, there were 2 cases, each in childhood and adult, showed no deletion at the time of diagnosis, their p16 deletions occurred at relapse. The deletion of p16 was associated with poor overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) in both childhood and adults. According to the standard of NCI risk stratification, we divided patients of two groups into standard and high risk category respectively, and performed further analysis. The significance of different risk category in children and adults was disparity. The overall survival (OS) rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 were 45.3% and 79.8% (P = 0.006) in children, and 7.7% and 22.6% (P = 0.002) in adults, respectively. EFS rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 were 33.5% and 58.1% (P = 0.008) in children, and 0 and 10.9% (P < 0.01) in adults, respectively. Of the standard risk category in children, OS rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 were 46.8% and 89.3% (P = 0.015) respectively, and EFS rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 as of 40.9% and 82.1% (P = 0.007) respectively. Of the high risk category in children, OS rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 were 41.7% and 67.4% (P = 0.193) respectively, and EFS rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 were 25.0% and 25.6% (P = 0.305) respectively. Of the standard risk category in adults, OS rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 were 20.0% and 46.9% (P = 0.092) respectively, and EFS rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 were 0 and 25.0% (P = 0.062) respectively. Of the high risk category in adults, OS rates of deletion and no deletion of p16 were 0 and 12.4% (P < 0.001) respectively, and EFS rate of deletion and no deletion of p16 was 0 and 4.8%(P < 0.001), respectively.

METHODS: The clinical data of 26 CLL patients receiving FCR regimen in our hospital from April 2003 to January 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were grouped according to indicators including Rai risk stratification, beta(2)-MG, LDH, ZAP-70, CD38, cytogenetics and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IgVH) mutation status. Therapy efficacy and survival were evaluated and the safety of FCR regimen was assessed. RESULTS: Among 26 patients, the overall response rate ( ORR ) was 76.9%, 10 patients (38.5%) achieved complete remission(CR) and 10(38.5%) partial remission(PR).

PFS and OS time in minimal residual disease(MRD)-negative, normal LDH and proportions of bone marrow lymphocytes declining >/= 50% after 2 courses of FCR patients were significantly better than that of the control group (P0.05), PFS in the non-high-risk genetics group was significantly better than that in the high-risk genetics group (P = 0.005), while OS between two groups showed no statistically significant difference. The most common toxicities were gastrointestinal reactions (88.5%), followed by bone marrow suppression (80.8%): including neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Infections accounted for 30.8%, mainly lung infection. CONCLUSION: FCR is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for patients with CLL. Patients with MRD-positive, elevated LDH, proportions of bone marrow lymphocytes declining50% after 2 courses of FCR and high risk genetics patients are suitable for more effective treatment after achieving treatment response.","['Li, Fei', 'Yi, Shu-hua', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Xing, Li-jie', 'Xu, Yan', 'Qi, Jun-yuan', 'Zhao, Yao-zhong', 'Li, Zeng-jun', 'Qiu, Lu-gui']","['Li F', 'Yi SH', 'Yu Z', 'Xing LJ', 'Xu Y', 'Qi JY', 'Zhao YZ', 'Li ZJ', 'Qiu LG']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 May;34(5):383-8. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.05.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an EMA report, the mortality rate was estimated at 11.7% and a warning was issued for increasing the dose from 30 to 40 mg/kg/day. In an earlier FDA report of 2474 individual fatality cases, it was revealed that deferasirox was used in many categories of patients. Among the fatal cases reported were many young individuals and about 500 patients with normal iron stores such as cancer, leukaemia, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. The iron-loaded patient categories included myelodysplasia, sickle cell disease, haemochromatosis and thalassaemia. The rate of fatalities and the number of patient categories involved suggest that there has been an indiscriminate and uncontrollable use of deferasirox. These findings raise major concerns on patient safety and question the role, practices and procedures adopted by pharmaceutical companies, regulatory authorities, physicians, etc. in the development of new drugs and their safety. The generic drugs deferiprone, deferoxamine and their combination offer a safer, less expensive and complete treatment of iron overload in thalassaemia and other iron loading conditions.","['Kontoghiorghes, George J']",['Kontoghiorghes GJ'],,['eng'],,"['Editorial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130521,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Triazoles)', '2BTY8KH53L (Deferiprone)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Benzoates/*adverse effects', 'Deferasirox', 'Deferiprone', 'Deferoxamine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*adverse effects', 'Iron Overload/drug therapy', 'Marketing', '*Patient Safety', 'Pyridones/therapeutic use', 'Thalassemia/drug therapy', 'Triazoles/*adverse effects']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2014/04/03 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740338.2013.799664 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2013 Sep;12(5):605-9. doi: 10.1517/14740338.2013.799664.

Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl1), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, regulates the balance between autophagy and apoptosis. However, little is known regarding its expression profile and contribution to cell fate in the brain following ischemic stroke. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the expression profile and cellular distribution of Mcl1 in brains from transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rats. Brain slices from sham-operated control rats showed minimal immunoreactivity for Mcl1. Mcl1 was mainly produced in neurons. Immunoreactivity for Mcl1 increased as early as 4 hours after MCAO, peaked at 24 hours, and then declined, but still remained high, at 72 hours. Mcl1 positive cells never colocalized with either cleaved caspase-3 or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Both microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and beclin-1 were evident in ischemic brain between 4 and 72 hours after MCAO. Most cells with strong LC3 staining were also labeled with beclin-1. Beclin-1 did colocalize with caspase-3 or Mcl1. Beclin-1/caspase-3 positive cells displayed the characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage and pyknotic nuclei, whereas beclin-1/Mcl1 positive cells had normal morphology. Pretreatment with 3-methyladenine attenuated autophagy without affecting the level of Mcl1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the expression of Mcl1 is involved in the survival of neuronal cells. In addition, the coexpression of Mcl1 with beclin-1 may attenuate beclin-1-dependent autophagy during ischemic stroke in rats.","['Xingyong, Chen', 'Xicui, Sun', 'Huanxing, Su', 'Jingsong, Ou', 'Yi, Huang', 'Xu, Zhang', 'Ruxun, Huang', 'Zhong, Pei']","['Xingyong C', 'Xicui S', 'Huanxing S', 'Jingsong O', 'Yi H', 'Xu Z', 'Ruxun H', 'Zhong P']","['Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510080, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,England,BMC Neurosci,BMC neuroscience,100966986,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Becn1 protein, rat)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Autophagy/drug effects/*physiology', 'Beclin-1', 'Brain/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery/*complications/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/*physiology']",PMC3668241,,2013/05/22 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2202-14-56 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2202-14-56 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Neurosci. 2013 May 20;14:56. doi: 10.1186/1471-2202-14-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 gene expression is maintained at low levels in vivo by unknown mechanisms. A combination therapy of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and zidovudin (AZT) shows therapeutic effects in ATL patients, although its mechanism is also obscure. We previously found that viral gene expression in IL-2-dependent HTLV-1-infected T-cells (ILTs) derived from ATL patients was markedly suppressed by stromal cells through a type I IFN response. Here, we investigated the effects of IFN-alpha with or without AZT on viral gene expression and cell growth in ILTs. RESULTS: ILTs expressed variable but lower amounts of HTLV-1 Tax protein than HTLV-1-transformed HUT102 cells. Following the addition of IFN-alpha, the amounts of HTLV-1 p19 in the supernatants of these cells decreased in three days, while HTLV-1 gene expression decreased only in ILTs but not HUT102 cells. IFN-alpha also suppressed the spontaneous HTLV-1 induction in primary ATL cells cultured for 24 h. A time course study using ILTs revealed that the levels of intracellular Tax proteins decreased in the first 24 h after addition of IFN-alpha, before the reduction in HTLV-1 mRNA levels. The initial decreases of Tax protein following IFN-alpha treatment were observed in 6 of 7 ILT lines tested, although the reduction rates varied among ILT lines. An RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-inhibitor reversed IFN-mediated suppression of Tax in ILTs. IFN-alpha also induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and suppressed NF-kappaB activities in these cells. AZT alone did not affect HTLV-1 gene expression, cell viability or NF-kappaB activities. AZT combined with IFN-alpha markedly induced cell apoptosis associated with phosphorylation of p53 and induction of p53-responsive genes in ILTs. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha suppressed HTLV-1 gene expression at least through a PKR-mediated mechanism, and also induced cell cycle arrest in ILTs. In combination with AZT, IFN-alpha further induced p53 signaling and cell apoptosis in these cells. These findings suggest that HTLV-1-infected cells at an IL-2-dependent stage retain susceptibility to type I IFN-mediated regulation of viral expression, and partly explain how AZT/IFN-alpha produces therapeutic effects in ATL.","['Kinpara, Shuichi', 'Kijiyama, Mami', 'Takamori, Ayako', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Sasada, Amane', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Kinpara S', 'Kijiyama M', 'Takamori A', 'Hasegawa A', 'Sasada A', 'Masuda T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology/*virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology', 'eIF-2 Kinase/metabolism']",PMC3698133,,2013/05/22 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-52 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-52 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 May 20;10:52. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no report on E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts in human NSCLC tissue specimens and cell lines. We analyzed correlation of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts with clinical outcomes in 76 patients with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and other subgroups. We compared mutation status of k-ras, p53 and EGFR in 22 patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts. RESULTS: We detected E2A-PBX1 transcripts in 23 of 184 (12.5%) NSCLC tissue specimens and 3 of 13 (23.1%) NSCLC cell lines. Presence of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts correlated with smoking status in female patients (P=0.048), AIS histology (P=0.006) and tumor size (P=0.026). The overall survival was associated with gender among AIS patients (P=0.0378) and AIS patients without E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts (P=0.0345), but not among AIS patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts (P=0.6401). The overall survival was also associated with status of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts among AIS stage IA patients (P=0.0363) and AIS stage IA female patients (P=0.0174). In addition, among the 22 patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts, 12 (54.5%) patients including all four non-smokers, showed no common mutations in k-ras, p53 and EGFR.

Standard intensive induction treatment continues to comprise cytarabine and a topoisomerase II (topo II) poison, usually an anthracycline. Vosaroxin , a novel first-in-class quinolone derivative has been developed for use in the treatment of AML as a new-generation topo II inhibitor. It has shown promising activity as a monotherapy and also in combination with intermediate dose cytarabine (IDAC) in relapsed and refractory patient cohorts with minimal toxicity and good tolerability. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss the mechanism of action of vosaroxin, the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, preclinical and clinical trial results available as well as areas of ongoing research. EXPERT OPINION: Vosaroxin has shown efficacy as a novel cytotoxic agent, and despite a similar mechanism of action has significant advantages over anthracyclines. It evades common resistance pathways of p53 and P-glycoprotein (P- gp) and does not appear to generate significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with these agents. Should future investigation confirm its efficacy and advantageous safety profile, vosaroxin could potentially replace older generation topoisomerase poisons in the treatment of AML and other malignant conditions.","['Freeman, Ciara', 'Keane, Niamh', 'Swords, Ronan', 'Giles, Francis']","['Freeman C', 'Keane N', 'Swords R', 'Giles F']","['Department of Haematology, Pathology and Pharmacy Building, Barts and the London NHS Trust, 80 Newark Street, Whitechapel, E1 2ES, London, UK. freemanciara@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130520,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Naphthyridines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",,,2013/05/22 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2013.799138 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2013 Jul;14(10):1417-27. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2013.799138.

METHODS: Fifty-five women with tubal pregnancy were divided into two groups according to whether LNG-EC was administrated during the cycle of conception. The serum concentrations of beta-hCG, E2 and P were measured. The mRNA and protein expressions of estrogen and progesterone receptors, leukemia inhibitory factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and endocannabinoid receptor - CB1 in the ectopic implantation site and chorionic villi were examined. RESULTS: Compared to those unexposed to LNG-EC, women with tubal pregnancy exposed to LNG-EC during the cycle of conception had no statistically significances in the serum concentrations of beta-hCG, E2 P, nor in the pathological types of tubal pregnancy or the expressions of ER-alpha, PR, LIF, VEGF, iNOS and CB1. CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of candidate molecules in the fallopian tube and chorionic villi were not altered by exposure to LNG-EC. A routine therapy with no additional intervention might thus be applied to tubal pregnancy exposed to LNG-EC.","['Huang, Changxiao', 'Zhang, Mei', 'Meng, Chunxia', 'Shi, Wei', 'Sun, Lulu', 'Zhang, Jian']","['Huang C', 'Zhang M', 'Meng C', 'Shi W', 'Sun L', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '5W7SIA7YZW (Levonorgestrel)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Chorionic Villi/*metabolism', 'Contraception, Postcoital/methods', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Fallopian Tubes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Levonorgestrel/*pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Tubal/*genetics', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3671131,,2013/05/22 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7827-11-46 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7827-11-46 [doi]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2013 May 20;11:46. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-11-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to analyse the incidence, diagnostic procedures and treatment of IA in hematooncological department in large hospital in the Czech Republic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical and laboratory records from patients hospitalised in our department with proven/probable IA between January 2000 and December 2006 was performed. RESULTS: 52 cases of IA in 51 patients were identified (17.3% proven IA/82.7% probable IA). Number of IA cases notably increased during study period (1 case of IA in 2000 vs 21 cases of IA in 2006) and majority of them was of nosocomial origin (61.5%). Pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in 46 cases (88.5%). Patients treated for acute leukemia or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation represent the group at the highest risk of IA (in total 52% of cases). Fever and signs of pulmonary involvement were the most common clinical signs of infection (presented in 92.3% and 69.2 cases respectively). Conventional diagnostic methods including autopsy were able to diagnose only 15 cases of IA (28.8%). In all other cases (71.2%) the diagnosis was done by detection of galactomannan (GM) in serum. Introduction of GM monitoring enabled erlier initiation of antifungal treatment by 4 days. Initial therapy of IA led to the treatment response (partial and complete) in 18 (34.6%) of infections--the highest percentage of response has been seen in voriconazole monotherapy group (42%) and when combination of voriconazole and caspofungin has been used (83%). Salvage therapy was initiated due to the failure of initial treatment in 21 (40.3%) of cases. Patients were treated mostly with combination ofvoriconazole and caspofungin and/or monotherapy with voriconazole has been used with treatment response 55% and 50% respectively. Introduction of new antifungal drugs together with increased number of patients with IA led to the marked increase of total costs spent on treatment of IA per year--from 11,5 thousands CZK in 2000 to 6,2 millions CZK in 2006. CONCLUSIONS: IA is the most frequent cause of infection-related mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. Routine use of non-culture base methods in diagnosis of IA together with treatment using new, effective antifungals can improve prognosis of patients with this life threatening infection.","['Racil, Z', 'Mayer, J', 'Kocmanova, I', 'Wagnerova, B', 'Winterova, J', 'Folber, F', 'Lengerova, M', 'Moulis, M', 'Zackova, D', 'Smardova, L', 'Janikova, A', 'Navratil, M', 'Dvorakova, D', 'Vorlicek, J']","['Racil Z', 'Mayer J', 'Kocmanova I', 'Wagnerova B', 'Winterova J', 'Folber F', 'Lengerova M', 'Moulis M', 'Zackova D', 'Smardova L', 'Janikova A', 'Navratil M', 'Dvorakova D', 'Vorlicek J']",['Interni hematoonkologicka klinika Lekarske fakulty MU a FN Brno. zracil@fnbrno.cz'],['cze'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aspergillosis/*complications/diagnosis/economics/therapy', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors']",,,2008/02/01 00:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2008 Feb;54(2):157-68.,,,,,"Invazivni aspergilove infekce u hematoonkologickych nemocnych: vyznam jednotlivych diagnostickych metod, lecebnych postupu a nastin financni narocnosti lecby.",,,,,,,,,,['Vnitr Lek. 2008 Feb;54(2):133-4.

De novo formation of cavernomas after cerebral radiotherapy has been suspected since 1994. They are mostly seen in children after irradiation of brain tumours. Radiation dose and the developing juvenile brain are predisposing factors causing cavernomas. However, the underlying mechanisms are still far from being understood. In adults, radiation-induced cavernomas (RICs) usually occur 10 years after a high cumulative radiation dosage of >30 Gy. Here, we report a 45-year-old man with new-onset focal epileptic seizures caused by a haemorrhagic lesion noted on cerebral computed tomography scan. Brain MRI showed the typical appearance of a ruptured cavernoma. Of note, a cerebral MRI scan 5 years earlier showed no corresponding lesion. The patient had been treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 16 years before. As part of this procedure, total body irradiation (TBI) consisting of 12 Gy was administered. According to the data from the literature, the typical delay from irradiation and a former normal brain MRI scan, we assume that our patient suffers from a RIC. To our knowledge, this is the first documented adult AML patient with a RIC treated with TBI. We aim to increase awareness among neurologists for the association of cranial irradiation or TBI and de novo cavernomas in patients suffering from malignant diseases.","['Walch, Julia', 'Tettenborn, Barbara', 'Weber, Johannes', 'Hundsberger, Thomas']","['Walch J', 'Tettenborn B', 'Weber J', 'Hundsberger T']","['Department of Neurology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20130418,Switzerland,Case Rep Neurol,Case reports in neurology,101517693,,,,PMC3656671,,2013/05/21 06:00,2013/05/21 06:01,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000351069 [doi]', 'crn-0005-0091 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Neurol. 2013 Apr 18;5(1):91-7. doi: 10.1159/000351069.

In 3 patients who developed characteristic skin nodules on initiation of FLT3-inhibition, we conducted dermatopathologic evaluation of skin samples, as well as FLT3 and NPM1 mutational analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. All 3 patients demonstrated characteristically deep dermal and subcutaneous neutrophilic infiltrates without evidence of myeloblasts. Discovery of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations in 2 of the samples, as well as the presence of FLT3-ITD and deletion of 7q in the other, confirmed the ancestry of the differentiated neutrophils as that of the original FLT3-mutant myeloblasts.

An early immature gene expression signature, the absence of bi-allelic TCRG deletion, CD13 surface expression, heterozygous deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17, and mutations in IDH1/IDH2 and DNMT3A genes are associated with poor prognosis in this series. In contrast, expression of CD8 or CD62L, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B, NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 mutations, and mutations or deletions in the BCL11B tumor suppressor gene were associated with improved overall survival. Importantly, the prognostic relevance of CD13 expression and homozygous CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletions was restricted to cortical and mature T-ALLs. Conversely, mutations in IDH1/IDH2 and DNMT3A were specifically associated with poor outcome in early immature adult T-ALLs.

In mice, expression of endogenous oncogenic Nras (Nras(G12D/+)) in hematopoietic cells leads to expansion of myeloid progenitors, increased long-term reconstitution of bone marrow cells, and a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). However, acute expression of Nras(G12D/+) in a pure C57BL/6 background does not induce hyperactivated granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling or increased proliferation in myeloid progenitors. It is thus unclear how Nras(G12D/+) signaling promotes leukemogenesis. Here, we show that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) expressing Nras(G12D/+) serve as MPN-initiating cells. They undergo moderate hyperproliferation with increased self-renewal. The aberrant Nras(G12D/+) HSC function is associated with hyperactivation of ERK1/2 in HSCs. Conversely, downregulation of MEK/ERK by pharmacologic and genetic approaches attenuates the cycling of Nras(G12D/+) HSCs and prevents the expansion of Nras(G12D/+) HSCs and myeloid progenitors. Our data delineate critical mechanisms of oncogenic Nras signaling in HSC function and leukemogenesis.","['Wang, Jinyong', 'Kong, Guangyao', 'Liu, Yangang', 'Du, Juan', 'Chang, Yuan-I', 'Tey, Sin Ruow', 'Zhang, Xinmin', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Saba-El-Leil, Marc K', 'Meloche, Sylvain', 'Damnernsawad, Alisa', 'Zhang, Jingfang', 'Zhang, Jing']","['Wang J', 'Kong G', 'Liu Y', 'Du J', 'Chang YI', 'Tey SR', 'Zhang X', 'Ranheim EA', 'Saba-El-Leil MK', 'Meloche S', 'Damnernsawad A', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang J']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. wang_jinyong@gibh.ac.cn']",['eng'],"['P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MOP-119327/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', '1R01CA152108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-UW/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130517,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3695364,,2013/05/21 06:00,2013/09/18 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57230-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-12-475863 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 27;121(26):5203-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-12-475863.

The mean values of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin: 12 +/- 1.8 g/dl; hematocrit: %35 +/- 6; platelet count: 156,000 +/- 68,000/mm(3); leukocyte count: 50,500 +/- 38,700/mm(3); and lymphocyte count: 45,700 +/- 38,100/mm(3). The study was performed in three cell cultures groups. Mononuclear cells of blood samples from peripheral veins were separated by Ficoll method. On culture plate with 24 wells, it was suspended with 2 ml RPMI 1640. Then, the plates were incubated in %5 CO2 at 37 degrees C for 24 h. 5 muM atorvastatin-calcium was given to first group, 2 muM rosiglitazone maleate was given to second group, and the third group was included in the study as control group. After 24 h, the expressions of CD5, CD38, ZAP-70 and Annexin V by using flow cytometry with EPICS XL-MCL and the levels of bcl-2 by using ELISA method were re-evaluated. Two-paired Student's t test was used for comparison of the results, and p < 0.05 was accepted as a significance level. While atorvastatin and rosiglitazone did not affect the expression of CD38 and the level of bcl-2, these drugs significantly increased the level of Annexin V when compared with control group (p < 0.001). Both drugs significantly decreased the expressions of CD5 (p = 0.03) and ZAP-70 (p < 0.05) compared with control group. Atorvastatin and rosiglitazone increased apoptosis in lymphocytes of CLL in vitro. Moreover, these drugs decreased the expressions of CD5 and ZAP-70. These drugs must be studied in more detail in the pathogenesis and treatment for CLL.","['Yavasoglu, Irfan', 'Sargin, Gokhan', 'Kadikoylu, Gurhan', 'Karul, Aslihan', 'Bolaman, Zahit']","['Yavasoglu I', 'Sargin G', 'Kadikoylu G', 'Karul A', 'Bolaman Z']","['Division of Hematology, Adnan Menderes University Medical Faculty, Aydin, Turkey. dr_yavas@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130519,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Heptanoic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Atorvastatin', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Heptanoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Thiazolidinediones/*pharmacology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2014/04/18 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-013-0603-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2013;30(3):603. doi: 10.1007/s12032-013-0603-y.

However, knowledge of the molecular regulation of SSX is still limited. In this study, we demonstrate that SSX or its SYT fusion protein is distributed as nuclear speckles, in which it is co-localized with B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1), which is a core factor of polycomb repressor complex 1. The C-terminal residues of SSX are indispensable for the nuclear speckle distribution, while the N-terminal domain is necessary for the recruitment of Bmi1, indicating that intact SSX must be needed for interaction with Bmi1 both spatially and functionally. In addition, the N-terminus of SSX also proved to contain an intrinsic nucleolar localization signal, which mediates the nucleolar translocation of SSX in particular kinds of cell stress such as the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide or heat shock. This stress-induced translocation is reversible and accompanied by HSP 70 or p14ARF traffic, suggesting that SSX is a stress response gene. It is of note that nucleolar translocation of SSX can result in disassociation of SSX from Bmi1, with consequent down-regulation of Bmi1 activity. These novel findings regarding distinct domains of SSX and its interaction with Bmi1 may shed light on the mechanism by which synovial sarcoma develops and on the up-regulation of SSX in cancer cells.","['Wang, Jiaochen', 'Wang, Huali', 'Hou, Wei', 'Liu, Haijing', 'Zou, Yongxin', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Hou, Lin', 'McNutt, Michael A', 'Zhang, Bo']","['Wang J', 'Wang H', 'Hou W', 'Liu H', 'Zou Y', 'Zhang H', 'Hou L', 'McNutt MA', 'Zhang B']","['Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Health Science Center of Peking University, Haidian District, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130518,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '164289-47-8 (synovial sarcoma X breakpoint proteins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Cell Compartmentation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleolus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Response/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/metabolism']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2014/02/13 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-013-1684-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2013 Sep;381(1-2):17-29. doi: 10.1007/s11010-013-1684-9.

We have also shown that CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells, one of compartments enriched for leukemia stem cells in most leukemia subgroups, were relatively resistant to cytarabine-mediated growth inhibition when compared to their CD34(+) /CD38(+) counterparts. Our study attempted to identify therapeutic targets in CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells and found that CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells isolated from patients (n = 26) expressed larger amounts of AURKA than their CD34(+) /CD38(+) counterparts and CD34(+) normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells isolated from healthy volunteers (n = 6), as measured by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Blockade of AURKA by the specific inhibitor MLN8237 or a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against AURKA significantly inhibited proliferation, impaired self-renewal capability and induced apoptosis of CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells, in association with modulation of levels of Bcl-2 family member proteins. Importantly, inhibition of AURKA in CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells by MLN8237 or an shRNA significantly impaired engraftment of these cells in severely immunocompromised mice and appeared to prolong their survival. These results suggest that AURKA is a promising molecular target to eliminate chemotherapy-resistant CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells.","['Yang, Jing', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Nishioka, Chie', 'Nobumoto, Atsuya', 'Udaka, Keiko', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Yang J', 'Ikezoe T', 'Nishioka C', 'Nobumoto A', 'Udaka K', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan; Department of Immunology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130610,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (MLN 8237)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase A/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28277 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Dec 1;133(11):2706-19. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28277.

To identify novel risk factors, we performed transcriptome sequencing on 68 diagnostic AML samples and identified 2 transcript variants (-E2 and -E2/3) of the alpha-subunit (ITGA5) of the very late antigen-5 integrin. We then quantified expression of ITGA5 and these splice variants in specimens from participants of the AAML03P1 trial. We found no association between ITGA5 expression and clinical outcome. In contrast, patients with the highest relative expression (Q4) of the -E2/3 ITGA5 splice variant less likely had low-risk disease than Q1-3 patients (21% vs. 38%, P = 0.027). Q4 patients had worse response to chemotherapy with a higher proportion having persistent minimal residual disease (50% vs. 23%, P = 0.003) and inferior overall survival (at 5 years: 48% vs. 67%, P = 0.015); the latter association was limited to low-risk patients (Q4 vs. Q1-3: 56% vs. 85%, P = 0.043) and was not seen in standard-risk (51% vs. 60%, P = 0.340) or high-risk (33% vs. 38%, P = 0.952) patients.

This report suggests the effectiveness of liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole for S. commune infection in immunocompromised patients.

The latter is the common signal-transducing molecule that couples these cytokines to their downstream effectors, Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). IL-6-type cytokine signalling additionally involves the recruitment and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2. Both STATs and ERKs regulate responses mediated by members of the IL-6 family. Here, we show that ERK2, but not ERK1, also controls the expression and function of gp130 per se, as silencing ERK2 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells inhibits the expression of gp130. This does not simply reflect quantitative differences between ERK1 and ERK2, and the effects are not restricted to osteosarcoma cells, as they can be extended to several other cancer cell types analysed to date (such as breast, prostate, lung and cervical cancer cells). Importantly, ERK2 binds to the GP130 promoter, where it perhaps interacts with the transcriptional machinery. Indeed, its role in the transcriptional regulation of the GP130 gene was corroborated using luciferase reporter assays and messenger RNA stability experiments. Considering the pivotal role that gp130 has in cancer and inflammation these data thus identify novel non-overlapping functions for ERK1 and ERK2 that are biologically relevant.","['Bonito, N A', 'Drechsler, J', 'Stoecker, S', 'Carmo, C R', 'Seckl, M J', 'Hermanns, H M', 'Costa-Pereira, A P']","['Bonito NA', 'Drechsler J', 'Stoecker S', 'Carmo CR', 'Seckl MJ', 'Hermanns HM', 'Costa-Pereira AP']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, UK.', 'Rudolf Virchow Center, DFG Research Center for Experimental Biomedicine, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, UK.', '1] Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, UK [2] Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, UK.', 'Rudolf Virchow Center, DFG Research Center for Experimental Biomedicine, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013159 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Apr 24;33(17):2255-63. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.159.

Overexpression of ephrin-A1 has been implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms are not clear. Here, we report a role of the Eph/ephrin system in a cell adhesion mechanism. Clustered erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A1 (EphA1)/ephrin-A1 complexes on the plasma membrane did not undergo endocytosis, and the cell remained adherent to one another. The cell-cell contacts were maintained in an Eph tyrosine kinase activity-independent manner even in the absence of E-cadherin. EphA1 and ephrin-A1 co-localized in pulmonary endothelial cells, and regulated vascular permeability and metastasis in the lungs. We identified ADAM12 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12) as an EphA1-binding partner by yeast two-hybrid screening and found that ADAM12 enhanced ephrin-A1 cleavage in response to transforming growth factor-beta1 in primary tumors. Released soluble ephrin-A1 in the serum deteriorated the EphA1/ephrin-A1-mediated cell adhesion in the lungs in an endocrine manner, causing lung hyperpermeability that facilitated tumor cell entry into the lungs. Depletion of soluble ephrin-A1 by its neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited lung metastasis.","['Ieguchi, K', 'Tomita, T', 'Omori, T', 'Komatsu, A', 'Deguchi, A', 'Masuda, J', 'Duffy, S L', 'Coulthard, M G', 'Boyd, A', 'Maru, Y']","['Ieguchi K', 'Tomita T', 'Omori T', 'Komatsu A', 'Deguchi A', 'Masuda J', 'Duffy SL', 'Coulthard MG', 'Boyd A', 'Maru Y']","[""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Laboratoire de Morphogenese et Signalisation Cellulaires, UMR 144, CNRS, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Leukemia Foundation Research Laboratory, The Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Leukemia Foundation Research Laboratory, The Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ephrin-A1)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM12 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Adam12 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*physiology', 'ADAM12 Protein', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/drug therapy/*enzymology/secondary', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ephrin-A1/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/secondary', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proteolysis', 'Receptor, EphA2/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/physiology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013180 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.180 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Apr 24;33(17):2179-90. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.180.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that CSCs are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into various types of cancer cells. Aberrant regulation of gene expression and some signaling pathways has been observed in CSCs compared to other tumor cells. CSCs are thought to be responsible for cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, recurrence and drug resistance. The CSC hypothesis has recently attracted much attention due to the potential for discovery and development of CSC-related therapies and the identification of key molecules involved in controlling the unique properties of CSC populations. Over the past several years, a tremendous amount of effort has been invested in the development of new drugs, such as nanomedicines, that can take advantage of the ""Achilles' heel"" of CSCs by targeting cell-surface molecular markers or various signaling pathways. Novel compounds and therapeutic strategies that selectively target CSCs have been identified, some of which have been evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. In this article, we review new findings related to the investigation of the CSC hypothesis, and discuss the crucial pathways involved in regulating the development of CSC populations and the advances in studies of drug resistance.

A248 inhibited the growth of DU145 and PC3 cells and induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by nuclear fragmentation and the accumulation of cells at subG1 phase of cell cycle. The treatment of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells with A248 resulted in the downregulation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) expression.

These data suggest that A248 has apoptotic activity in human prostate cancer cells and that Sp1 may be the molecular target of A248 treatment for inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.","['Choi, Eun-Sun', 'Han, Gyoonhee', 'Park, Song-Kyu', 'Lee, Kiho', 'Kim, Hyun-Jung', 'Cho, Sung-Dae', 'Kim, Hwan Mook']","['Choi ES', 'Han G', 'Park SK', 'Lee K', 'Kim HJ', 'Cho SD', 'Kim HM']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Brain Korea 21 Project, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 561-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Survivin']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2013.1481 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2013 Jul;8(1):195-200. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2013.1481.

Here we present viSNE, a tool that allows one to map high-dimensional cytometry data onto two dimensions, yet conserve the high-dimensional structure of the data. viSNE plots individual cells in a visual similar to a scatter plot, while using all pairwise distances in high dimension to determine each cell's location in the plot. We integrated mass cytometry with viSNE to map healthy and cancerous bone marrow samples. Healthy bone marrow automatically maps into a consistent shape, whereas leukemia samples map into malformed shapes that are distinct from healthy bone marrow and from each other. We also use viSNE and mass cytometry to compare leukemia diagnosis and relapse samples, and to identify a rare leukemia population reminiscent of minimal residual disease. viSNE can be applied to any multi-dimensional single-cell technology.","['Amir, El-ad David', 'Davis, Kara L', 'Tadmor, Michelle D', 'Simonds, Erin F', 'Levine, Jacob H', 'Bendall, Sean C', 'Shenfeld, Daniel K', 'Krishnaswamy, Smita', 'Nolan, Garry P', ""Pe'er, Dana""]","['Amir el-AD', 'Davis KL', 'Tadmor MD', 'Simonds EF', 'Levine JH', 'Bendall SC', 'Shenfeld DK', 'Krishnaswamy S', 'Nolan GP', ""Pe'er D""]","['Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia Initiative for Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA164729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA130826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1-DP2-OD002414-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA034233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI100627/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HV-10-05(2)/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1U54CA121852-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008798/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN272200700038C/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09-011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'U19 AI057229/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD002414/OD/NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA130826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA121852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130519,United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Humans', '*Image Cytometry', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods']",PMC4076922,['NIHMS586764'],2013/05/21 06:00,2014/02/15 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['nbt.2594 [pii]', '10.1038/nbt.2594 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Biotechnol. 2013 Jun;31(6):545-52. doi: 10.1038/nbt.2594.

Identifying the in vivo counterpart of murine ESCs will be essential for the derivation of stable ESC lines from other species. Several hypotheses exist concerning the ontology of murine ESCs. Recent data demonstrate that ESCs emerge from a subpopulation of ICM cells that transit through a Blimp1-positive state, suggesting that perhaps a germ cell developmental program underlies ESC derivation and maintenance. Alternatively, the common dependence of ESCs and diapause embryos on the cytokine LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) has been thought to signify that murine ESCs employ a diapause-like program for their maintenance of pluripotency.

To clarify the molecular mechanisms of cell death induction, we investigated the molecular effects of the alpha-emitter Bismuth-213 (Bi-213) bound to a monoclonal anti-CD33-antibody ([Bi-213]anti-CD33) on the cell cycle and on apoptosis induction in sensitive as well as in beta- and gamma-radiation-resistant CD33-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. METHODS: The cytotoxic potential of the radioimmunoconjugate [Bi-213]anti-CD33 was analysed in the CD33-expressing human AML cell line HL-60 and in radiation- and chemoresistant HL-60-derived cell lines. Cell cycle and apoptosis induction analyses were performed via flow cytometry. Activation of apoptosis pathways was determined by immunodetection. RESULTS: [Bi-213]anti-CD33 induced apoptotic cell death in CD33-positive AML cells specifically. Molecular analyses revealed that the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis was activated resulting in caspase-9 activation. In the apoptotic executioner cascade caspase-3 was activated and its substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was cleaved. Notably, [Bi-213]anti-CD33 overcame radio- and chemoresistance by reversing deficient activation of apoptosis pathways in resistant CD33-positive AML cells and by the downregulation of inhibitors of apoptosis B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) involved in leukaemia resistance. CONCLUSION: [Bi-213]anti-CD33 exhibits its cytotoxic effects specifically in CD33-expressing AML cells via induction of the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. The abrogation of chemo- and radioresistances and the reactivation of apoptotic pathways seem to be promising for the treatment of patients with so far untreatable resistant AML and underline the importance of this emerging therapeutic approach of targeted alpha-therapies.","['Friesen, Claudia', 'Roscher, Mareike', 'Hormann, Inis', 'Leib, Oliver', 'Marx, Sebastian', 'Moreno, Josue', 'Miltner, Erich']","['Friesen C', 'Roscher M', 'Hormann I', 'Leib O', 'Marx S', 'Moreno J', 'Miltner E']","['Center for Biomedical Research, University Ulm, Helmholtzstrasse 8/1, 89081 Ulm, Germany; Institute for Legal Medicine, University Ulm, Prittwitzstrasse 6, 89075 Ulm, Germany.

The proliferation of imatinib- or nilotinib-resistant K562 cells did not decrease after treatment with imatinib or nilotinib. Src family kinase Lyn was activated.

Drug metabolism polymorphisms in Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6), Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and Dehydrogenase Quinone 1 (NQO1) enzymes and P-glycoprotein (MDR-1) could modify enzyme activity. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the influence of CYP2B6 G15631T, GSTT1, GSTM1, NQO1 C609T and MDR-1 C3435T polymorphisms on MDS progression. We analyzed 78 MDS patients using the PCR-RFLP and multiplex method. The frequency of GST deletions and MDR-1 CC genotype was lower in progression-free patients compared to patients with progression; GST: 17% vs. 35% (P=0.018); MDR-1 gene: 19% vs. 48% (P=0.012). We also verified the influence of GST deletions and MDR-1 C3435T on patient overall survival and found no significant difference (RR=0.75; P=0.599 and RR=0.79; P=0.594 respectively). We concluded that GSTM1 deletion may contribute toward MDS progression probably due to toxic metabolite accumulation which generates cell toxicity and DNA damage. Moreover, MDR-1 C3435T may have a protective effect against MDS progression because the expected lower expression of P-glycoprotein would lead to a higher degree of cell death. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the relationship of these polymorphisms with MDS progression.","['Palodetto, Bruna', 'de Melo Campos, Paula', 'Benites, Bruno Deltreggia', 'de Lourdes Lopes Ferrari Chauffaille, Maria', 'Velloso, Elvira Deolinda Rodrigues Pereira', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla']","['Palodetto B', 'de Melo Campos P', 'Benites BD', 'de Lourdes Lopes Ferrari Chauffaille M', 'Velloso ED', 'Traina F', 'Saad ST']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology, Hematology and Hemotherapy Center Campinas, University of Campinas/Hemocentro Campinas-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. brunapalodetto@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130517,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2B6 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6', 'Disease Progression', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2013/09/18 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(13)00146-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2013.04.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Aug;37(8):970-3. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2013.04.024.

Ninety-seven patients who underwent allogeneic SCT in CP were analyzed. Forty-seven were TKI-naive at the time of transplant, and 50 received TKI(s) treatment before transplantation. After a median follow-up of 115.8 months, the 4-year overall survival and event-free survival were 80.4 and 58.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that there were no differences in survival outcomes based on prior TKI therapy. Older age was a prognostic factor for higher treatment-related mortality (TRM), and the type of graft source and younger age were associated with relapse, but prior TKI therapy and disease status at the time of transplant were not associated with either TRM or relapse. Additionally, a major molecular response at 1 month and an MR(4.5) at 3 months were important predictors of favorable long-term outcomes. This study demonstrates the prognostic factors for the outcomes of allogeneic SCT in CP CML and shows that survival outcomes were not affected by the administration of long-term multi-TKI treatment prior to transplantation.","['Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Choi, Soo Young', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Jang, Eun-Jung', 'Bang, Ju-Hee', 'Byeun, Ji-Young', 'Park, Jin Eok', 'Jeon, Hye-Rim', 'Oh, Yun Jeong', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Sung', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Park, Chong-Won', 'Kim, Dong-Wook']","['Lee SE', 'Choi SY', 'Kim SH', 'Jang EJ', 'Bang JH', 'Byeun JY', 'Park JE', 'Jeon HR', 'Oh YJ', 'Yahng SA', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Park CW', 'Kim DW']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/enzymology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2015/01/01 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['hem220 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000100 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Mar;19(2):63-72. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000100.

We review the current literature to evaluate its effect on adults. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING & POPULATION: Adults receiving rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Electronic databases, regulatory documents, and websites were searched up to August 7, 2012. Reference lists of published articles were examined for additional relevant references. Any controlled trial or observational studies (controlled before and after) were included. Studies considering children only or mixing data for children and adults were excluded. INTERVENTION: Rasburicase for TLS. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was TLS development. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients improving, total adverse events, acute kidney failure, deaths, and serum uric acid and creatinine levels. RESULTS: 21 studies (24 publications) reported data for 1,261 adult patients, 768 receiving rasburicase for either the treatment or prophylaxis of TLS; these comprised 4 controlled trials and 17 observational studies. No statistically significant differences in clinical TLS development were observed in the controlled trials between the rasburicase and control groups. For the observational studies, 7.4% of patients developed clinical TLS after rasburicase (95% CI, 1.7%-16.7%), 93.4% of patients achieved normalized serum uric acid levels after rasburicase treatment (95% CI, 91.7%-94.6%), 4.4% developed acute kidney injury (95% CI, 3.0%-6.0%), and 2.6% died (95% CI, 0.95%-5.0%). The mean reduction in serum uric acid levels ranged from 5.3-12.8 mg/dL, and for serum creatinine levels, from 0.10-2.1 mg/dL. LIMITATIONS: Controlled trials differed in outcomes reported; meta-analysis was not performed. CONCLUSIONS: Rasburicase is effective in reducing serum uric acid levels in adults with TLS but at a significant cost, and evidence currently is lacking in adults to report whether rasburicase use improves clinical outcomes compared with other alternatives. Until new evidence is available, use of rasburicase may be limited to adult patients with a high risk of TLS.","['Lopez-Olivo, Maria A', 'Pratt, Gregory', 'Palla, Shana L', 'Salahudeen, Abdulla']","['Lopez-Olivo MA', 'Pratt G', 'Palla SL', 'Salahudeen A']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. amlopezo@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20130514,United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Urate Oxidase/*therapeutic use']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0272-6386(13)00676-8 [pii]', '10.1053/j.ajkd.2013.02.378 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 2013 Sep;62(3):481-92. doi: 10.1053/j.ajkd.2013.02.378.

Genetic variations in genes involved in drug transportation might influence the pharmacokinetic and metabolism of imatinib. The genotype of a patient is increasingly recognized in influencing the response to the treatment. AIM: To investigate the genotype frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) G2677T in CML patients undergoing imatinib treatment to determine whether different genotype pattern of these SNPs have any influence in mediating response to imatinib. METHODS: A total of 96 CML and 90 control samples were analyzed for the human multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) gene polymorphism (G2677T) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. RESULTS: Genotype distribution revealed a significant lower frequency of TT genotype in CML patients and non-significant difference in the GG, GT genotype frequencies between patients and controls (P = 0.004, 0.138, 0.210, respectively). GG genotype was significantly higher in chronic phase (P = 0.046), while GT genotype was significantly higher in Blastic crisis phase (P = 0.002). There was a significant difference in genotype frequency of G2677T among patients showing response and resistance to imatinib in chronic phase (P = 0.02). TT genotype was associated with complete hematological response (P = 0.01), complete cytogenetic response (P < 0.001), and better molecular response with a significant association (P < 0.001). GT genotype was associated with partial hematological response (P = 0.01) and minor cytogenetic response (P < 0.001). Optimal and suboptimal responses were observed for patients with TT genotype (P = 0.003). Failure of drug response was associated with GT genotype (P = 0.02); however, GG had no association with drug response. Multivariate analysis considered GT genotype as independent risk factor for resistance (P = 0.037), while TT genotype as protective factor against resistance to imatinib (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Determination of MDR1 polymorphisms (G2677T) might be useful in response prediction to therapy with imatinib in patients with CML.","['Elghannam, Doaa M', 'Ibrahim, Lamia', 'Ebrahim, Mohamed A', 'Azmy, Emad', 'Hakem, Hazem']","['Elghannam DM', 'Ibrahim L', 'Ebrahim MA', 'Azmy E', 'Hakem H']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20131125,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adult', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['hem190 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000102 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Apr;19(3):123-8. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000102.

Therefore, the present report describes detailed radiological and histopathological findings of a case of invasive pulmonary mucormycosis (IPM) presenting RHS with comparison to those from a lesion of discrete nodule caused by invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), and discusses the pathophysiological implications of this characteristic image. CASE PRESENTATION: RHS had been clinically noted at the time of recovering of bone marrow function of a 64-year-old Japanese man who had chemotherapy for his acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Histological examination of the surgically removed lung revealed a lesion of IPM. This was composed of coagulation necrosis of septa at the center of lesion with preservation of air content which was encompassed outer rim comprising triplet structure; liquefaction, consolidation, and organization from the inner to the outer layer. In addition, Micro-CT examination confirmed reticular structure and monotonous high density at the central coagulation necrosis preserving air content and surrounding consolidation, and organization lesion of the IPM lesion. CONCLUSION: Our investigations suggest that RHS might be understood as a kind of immune reconstitution syndrome and be the initial and prior status of air crescent sign.

We investigated the impact of the D-index on pulmonary infection in 33 acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing consolidation chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine. There was no difference in the D-index between chemotherapies with and without pulmonary infection. The cumulative D-index (c-D-index) until the development of infection exceeded 4000 in four of five patients with pulmonary infection.

Whole-body MRI using T1 and STIR sequences increases the detection of myeloma lesions. MRI-measured diffusion has demonstrated high sensitivity in terms of detection in oncology. The main objective of this study is to compare conventional radiographic staging with an MRI whole-body diffusion technique (called DWIBS) in detecting bone lesion monoclonal plasma cell pathologies (multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukaemia, plasmacytoma and MGUS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were included (multiple myeloma: 24; plasma cell leukaemia, MGUS and plasmacytoma: 1 each). All of them had a whole-body MRI diffusion examination (using a DWIBS sequence). Diffusion MRI and conventional radiographs were compared according to the Durie-Salmon Staging System. In case of doubtful lesions, 12 months of monitoring was used as the reference method for the definitive diagnosis. RESULTS: The overall concordance rate between the two techniques was 63%. The DWIBS sequence detected a higher number of lesions leading to a higher Durie-Salmon stage in 37% of the patients: one stage I to II, seven stage I to III, and two stage II to III. In 18.5% of the patients, the MRI was positive while the radiographs were normal and these discrepancies were most often located in sites poorly explored by X-ray (spine, pelvis and ribs). In one patient (4%), the MRI provided a stage lower than that of the X-rays (stage II vs. III). In this case, the X-rays were positive at the humerus and femur, unlike the DWIBS sequence. Our per site analysis confirmed the clear superiority of the DWIBS sequence when compared with X-rays in the exploration of the cervical spine (56 vs. 0%, P<0.001), dorsal spine (81vs. 31%,P<0.0002), lumbar spine (70 vs. 35%, P<0.0124), pelvis (81 vs. 33%, P<0.0005) and ribs (74 vs. 36%, P<0.0009). CONCLUSION: The DWIBS MRI leads to an increase in the final Durie-Salmon stage. Although its place in the preoperative treatment of multiple myeloma still has to be assessed, this study suggests its potential interest.","['Narquin, S', 'Ingrand, P', 'Azais, I', 'Delwail, V', 'Vialle, R', 'Boucebci, S', 'Tasu, J-P']","['Narquin S', 'Ingrand P', 'Azais I', 'Delwail V', 'Vialle R', 'Boucebci S', 'Tasu JP']","['Pole Imagerie Diagnostique Fonctionnelle et Therapeutique, CHU de Poitiers, rue de la Miletrie, 86000 Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20130515,France,Diagn Interv Imaging,Diagnostic and interventional imaging,101568499,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone and Bones/pathology', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Plasmacytoma/*pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Whole Body Imaging/*methods']",,,2013/05/21 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-5684(13)00006-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.diii.2013.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Diagn Interv Imaging. 2013 Jun;94(6):629-36. doi: 10.1016/j.diii.2013.01.005.

Previous studies provided some evidence of an association, but did not assess risk of NHL subtypes. METHODS: Cases and controls were members of Group Health, an integrated healthcare delivery system. Cases were persons diagnosed with NHL between 1980 and 2011 at age 25 years or older; eight control subjects were matched to each case on age, sex, and length of enrollment. Information on previous TCA use was ascertained from automated pharmacy data. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for NHL, overall and for common subtypes, for various patterns of TCA use. RESULTS: We identified 2768 cases and 22,127 matched control subjects. We did not observe an appreciably increased risk of NHL among TCA ever-users compared to non-users (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2). Overall risk of NHL was associated to at most a small degree with longer-term use (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4; >/=10 prescriptions), high-dose use (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.5; >/=50 mg), or non-recent use (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9 = 1.2; >5 years previously). TCA use was not associated with NHL subtypes, except chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0; longer-term use). CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence that the use of TCAs increases the risk of NHL overall or for specific common subtypes of NHL.","['Lowry, Sarah J', 'Chubak, Jessica', 'Press, Oliver W', 'McKnight, Barbara', 'Weiss, Noel S']","['Lowry SJ', 'Chubak J', 'Press OW', 'McKnight B', 'Weiss NS']","['Group Health Research Institute, Group Health Cooperative, Seattle, WA. slowry7@uw.edu']",['eng'],"['R03 CA156357/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,"['0 (Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idaho', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Washington']",PMC3718633,['NIHMS473491'],2013/05/21 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1047-2797(13)00096-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annepidem.2013.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2013 Jun;23(6):349-54. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2013.04.006.,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The Baltic cohort includes 17,040 men from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania who participated in the environmental cleanup after the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station in 1986-1991 and who were followed up for cancer incidence until the end of 2007. Cancer cases diagnosed in the cohort and in the male population of each country were identified from the respective national cancer registers. The proportional incidence ratio (PIR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate the site-specific cancer risk in the cohort. For comparison and as it was possible, the site-specific standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for the Estonian sub-cohort, which was not feasible for the other countries. RESULTS: Overall, 756 cancer cases were reported during 1986-2007. A higher proportion of thyroid cancers in relation to the male population was found (PIR=2.76; 95%CI 1.63-4.36), especially among those who started their mission shortly after the accident, in April-May 1986 (PIR=6.38; 95%CI 2.34-13.89). Also, an excess of oesophageal cancers was noted (PIR=1.52; 95% CI 1.06-2.11). No increased PIRs for leukaemia or radiation-related cancer sites combined were observed. PIRs and SIRs for the Estonian sub-cohort demonstrated the same site-specific cancer risk pattern. CONCLUSION: Consistent evidence of an increase in radiation-related cancers in the Baltic cohort was not observed with the possible exception of thyroid cancer, where conclusions are hampered by known medical examination including thyroid screening among cleanup workers.","['Rahu, Kaja', 'Hakulinen, Timo', 'Smailyte, Giedre', 'Stengrevics, Aivars', 'Auvinen, Anssi', 'Inskip, Peter D', 'Boice, John D Jr', 'Rahu, Mati']","['Rahu K', 'Hakulinen T', 'Smailyte G', 'Stengrevics A', 'Auvinen A', 'Inskip PD', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Rahu M']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, National Institute for Health Development, Tallinn, Estonia. kaja.rahu@tai.ee']",['eng'],"['N01 CP085638/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-85638-03/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130515,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adult', 'Baltic States/epidemiology', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3739289,['NIHMS473951'],2013/05/21 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(13)00326-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2013.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2013 Sep;49(13):2926-33. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2013.04.014.

Because of its rarity and a lack of clinical experience, no consensus has been reached about the best means of treating fungal myositis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of the treatment of fungal myositis with simultaneous intravenous and intra-lesional itraconazole. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old Chinese woman with acute myelomonocytic leukemia developed Candida krusei fungemia and fungal myositis in the right biceps brachii after chemotherapy. A course of intravenous itraconazole and subsequently intravenous voriconazole was initiated and her blood cultures became sterile; however, our patient remained febrile and the myositis did not resolve. Intravenous itraconazole was restarted simultaneously with low-dose intra-lesional itraconazole. The pyrexia settled after 48 hours and within 10 days the lesion could be seen to be resolving. After the course of intravenous and intra-lesional anti-fungals was complete, oral itraconazole was administered as maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge this is the first case in which fungal myositis was successfully treated with intravenous and intra-lesional itraconazole in a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. The efficacy and safety of locally-administered itraconazole to treat intractable soft tissue infections requires further evaluation.","['Lin, Xiao-Ji', 'Yao, Rong-Xin', 'He, Mu-Qing', 'Zhu, Bao-Ling', 'Guo, Wen-Jian']","['Lin XJ', 'Yao RX', 'He MQ', 'Zhu BL', 'Guo WJ']","['Department of Haematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, Zhejiang, China. yaorx828@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130519,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC3668258,,2013/05/21 06:00,2013/05/21 06:01,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/21 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-7-132 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-7-132 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2013 May 19;7:132. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-7-132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnostic paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) bone marrow samples were used to develop a classifier for response to induction therapy in 53 samples and validated in an independent set of 68 samples. The area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC(ROC)) was calculated to be 0.85 in the training set and after exclusion of induction deaths, the AUC(ROC) of the classifier was 0.70 (P = 0.02) and 0.67 (P = 0.04) in the validation set when induction deaths (intent to treat) were included. The highest predictive accuracy was noted in the cytogenetic intermediate risk patients (AUC(ROC) 0.88, P = 0.002), a subgroup that lacks prognostic/predictive biomarkers for induction response. Only white blood cell count and cytogenetic risk were associated with response to induction therapy in the validation set. After controlling for these variables, the SCNP classifier score was associated with complete remission (P = 0.017), indicating that the classifier provides information independent of other clinical variables that were jointly associated with response. This is the first validation of an SCNP classifier to predict response to induction chemotherapy. Herein we demonstrate the usefulness of quantitative SCNP under modulated conditions to provide independent information on AML disease biology and induction response.","['Lacayo, Norman J', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gayko, Urte', 'Rosen, David B', 'Westfall, Matt', 'Purvis, Norman', 'Putta, Santosh', 'Louie, Brent', 'Hackett, James', 'Cohen, Aileen Cleary', 'Cesano, Alessandra', 'Gerbing, Robert', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Dahl, Gary V', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Lacayo NJ', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gayko U', 'Rosen DB', 'Westfall M', 'Purvis N', 'Putta S', 'Louie B', 'Hackett J', 'Cohen AC', 'Cesano A', 'Gerbing R', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Dahl GV', 'Gamis A', 'Meshinchi S']","[""Children's Oncology Group, Arcadia, CA, USA. lacayon@stanford.edu""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130520,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Single-Cell Analysis/methods', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4654575,['NIHMS722527'],2013/05/21 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/05/21 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12370 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Jul;162(2):250-62. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12370.

Major progress has been made in assessing typical chromosomal abnormalities and recognition of the correlation of these chromosomal abnormalities with laboratory features and clinical course of the disease. The most frequent genomic changes are deletions at 13q14, 11q22-23 and 17p13 and trisomy of chromosome 12. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in B-CLL patients' peripheral blood and/or bone marrow using a molecular cytogenetic method, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) and to evaluate the correlation between these genomic changes and clinical findings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: I-FISH analyses were performed on bone marrow and blood samples of 66 B-CLL patients. RESULTS: Deletion of 17p13 was found in 11 (16.6%) and deletion 6q21 was present in 5 (7.5%). Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the correlation of these molecular-cytogenetic findings with family history, Rai staging and CD38 marker. No clear differences in distribution was noted for del17p13 and del6q21 among patients with and without family history, and no direct correlation was noted between these genomic changes and CD38 marker, but the correlation of del17p13 and Rai stage was significant. There was a high frequency of Rai stage II within del17p13 patients. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that the presence of del6q21 in B-CLL patients indicates poor prognosis and on the contrary, presence of del17p13 points at the good prognostic value of the disease.","['Teimori, Hossein', 'Ashoori, Saeede', 'Akbari, Mohamad Taghi', 'Mojtabavi Naeini, Marjan', 'Hashemzade Chaleshtori, Morteza']","['Teimori H', 'Ashoori S', 'Akbari MT', 'Mojtabavi Naeini M', 'Hashemzade Chaleshtori M']","['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, School of Medicine, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, IR Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130205,Iran,Iran Red Crescent Med J,Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,101319850,,,,PMC3652496,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/05/18 06:01,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5812/ircmj.4990 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran Red Crescent Med J. 2013 Feb;15(2):107-12. doi: 10.5812/ircmj.4990.

From March 1991 through April 2011, a total of 3237 HSCT were performed in the Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Here we report 20 years experience of HSCT. OBJECTIVES: Our strategy and aim include the protraction of cytogenetic and molecular biological diagnostic tests, the expansion of the first Iranian Cord Blood Bank (ICBB) and development of the first Iranian Stem Cell Donor Program (ISCDP), and improvement the researches in new therapeutic fields. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Totally, 3237 patients were undergone HSCT. Of these transplants, 2205 were allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 1016 autologous and 16 syngeneic. Among 2205 patients who were undergone allogenic-HSCT, 34 received cord blood stem cells as stem cell source for transplantation. It is important to point out that cord blood bank at our center provides reliable storage of cord blood stem cells for our patients. Stem cell transplantation was performed for treatment of various diseases such as acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, beta-thalassemia major, sickle- cell thalassemia, sickle- cell disease, multiple myeloma, myelodysplasia, mucopolysaccharidosis, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, severe aplastic anemia, plasma cell leukemia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, congenital neutropenia, leukocyte adhesion deficiencies, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, osteopetrosis, histiocytosis X, Hurler syndrome, amyloidosis, systemic sclerosis, breast cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, testicular cancer, germ cell tumors, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, ovarian cancer, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, pancreatoblastoma, and multiple sclerosis. Also, we had 220 cellular therapies for post-myocardial infarction, multiple sclerosis, cirrhosis, head of femur necrosis, Diabetes Mellitus and GvHD treatment. 45 patients were undergone retransplantation in this center. RESULTS: About 78.2% of the patients (2530 of 3237) remained alive between one to 211 months after stem cell transplantation. Nearly, 21.8% (707) of our patients died after stem cell transplantation. The main causes of death were relapse, infection, hemorrhagic cystitis, graft-versus- host disease and etc. CONCLUSIONS: In Iran, HSCT has been successfully adapted in routine clinical care.

A single-centre study.,1656-61,10.1002/pbc.24589 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against influenza is an important strategy in preventing severe infection among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Successful vaccination depends on both vaccine and host-related factors. We conducted a study on factors predicting the immunogenicity of the monovalent pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza A vaccine in children with ALL. METHODS: Children with ALL in our hospital were recruited and received two doses of the inactivated split-virion AS03-adjuvanted vaccine. The serological response was measured before each vaccine dose (Day 0 and 28) and 3 months after the second dose. Antibody titres were measured using a hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Seroconversion was defined as a >/=fourfold increase in antibody titre and a post-vaccination titre >/=1:40. RESULTS: Pre and post-vaccination titres were available from 45 children with ALL after one dose of the vaccine and 39 children after two doses. The seroconversion rate was 11.1% after one dose and 25.6% after the second dose. Univariate analysis demonstrated a significantly higher (P = 0.01) seroconversion rate among children who received the adult dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine and a trend towards increased seroconversion (P = 0.07) by multivariate analysis. Factors including age, gender, lymphocyte count, treatment phase and regimen did not significantly affect the seroconversion rate. Children who received the adult dose demonstrated a significantly greater magnitude of serological response after both one dose (P = 0.04) and two doses (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the immunogenicity of the pH1N1 vaccine among children with ALL is improved by repeated and adult doses of the vaccine.","['Leahy, T Ronan', 'Smith, Owen P', 'Bacon, Christopher L', 'Storey, Lorna', 'Lynam, Paul', 'Gavin, Patrick J', 'Butler, Karina M', ""O'Marcaigh, Aengus S""]","['Leahy TR', 'Smith OP', 'Bacon CL', 'Storey L', 'Lynam P', 'Gavin PJ', 'Butler KM', ""O'Marcaigh AS""]","[""Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland. tronanleahy@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Influenza Vaccines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Secondary', '*Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza Vaccines/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Influenza, Human/epidemiology/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Male', '*Pandemics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24589 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Oct;60(10):1656-61. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24589.

CECs were evaluated by four-color flow cytometry. Circulating progenitor cells were defined as CD45-/CD34+/CD31+/CD133+. Apoptotic CECs (ApoCECs) were defined as CD146+/AnnexinV+. RESULTS: Median (Me) CECs number was 10.5/microl and it decreased after chemotherapy (Me = 8.3/microl, P < 0.001 when compared with baseline). Based on the number of aphereses needed to obtain 2 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells, patients were divided into ""highly efficient"" (one apheresis) and ""poorly efficient"" mobilizers (two or more aphereses). Median ApoCEC at Day G+1 was lower in highly efficient than in poorly efficient mobilizers (Me = 3.1/microl vs. Me = 5.1/microl, P = 0.02). ApoCEC at Day G+1 correlated with the number of aphereses (r = 0.48, P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, ApoCEC at Day G+1 was an independent factor for successful mobilization during one apheresis. CONCLUSIONS: CECs and their subsets change significantly during mobilization of HSCs. ApoCECs measured at the time of G-CSF commencement can predict the efficacy of HSC collection.","['Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Krawczynska, Anna', 'Czemerska, Magdalena', 'Pluta, Agnieszka', 'Cebula-Obrzut, Barbara', 'Szmigielska, Katarzyna', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka']","['Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Krawczynska A', 'Czemerska M', 'Pluta A', 'Cebula-Obrzut B', 'Szmigielska K', 'Smolewski P', 'Robak T', 'Wierzbowska A']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Separation', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jca.21277 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2013 Oct;28(5):341-8. doi: 10.1002/jca.21277.

Despite the presence of extensive information about immunobiology of Tregs in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, little is known about the frequency and function of these cells in hematologic malignancies, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recent data have demonstrated increased frequency and intact functional capacity of CD4(+) Tregs in CLL patients. However, the precise role of these cells in the immunopathology of CLL is not well known. While targeting Tregs in cancer diseases seems to be an interesting immunotherapeutic approach, such therapeutic interventions in CLL might be deleterious due to suppression of the tumor-specific adaptive and innate immune responses. Thus, the precise biological and regulatory functions of all Tregs subsets should be carefully investigated before planning any immunotherapeutic interventions based on targeting of Tregs. In this communication, we review the recent data published on immunobiology of Tregs in CLL and discuss about the possibility of targeting Tregs in CLL.","['Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad', 'Ghalamfarsa, Ghasem', 'Yousefi, Mehdi', 'Tabrizi, Mina Hajifaraj', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Jadidi-Niaragh F', 'Ghalamfarsa G', 'Yousefi M', 'Tabrizi MH', 'Shokri F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130517,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,IM,"['CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-0832-x [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2013 Aug;34(4):2031-9. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-0832-x.

We examined self-reported cognitive function for older women who received adjuvant chemotherapy on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 49907. CALGB 49907 randomized 633 women aged >/=65 with stage I-III breast cancer to standard adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide) versus capecitabine. We examined self-reported cognitive function in 297 women (CALGB 361002) who enrolled on the quality of life substudy and had no gross impairment on cognitive screening. Women were evaluated using an 18-item instrument at six time points (baseline through 24 months). At each time point for each patient, we calculated a cognitive function score (CFS) defined as the mean response of items 1-18 and defined impairment as a score >1.5 standard deviations above the overall average baseline score. Differences in scores by patient characteristics were evaluated using a Kruskal-Wallis test. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess CFSs by treatment over time. Among 297 women, the median age was 71.5 (range 65-85) and 73 % had performance status of 0. Baseline depression and fatigue were reported in 6 and 14 % of patients, respectively. The average CFS at baseline was 2.08 (corresponding to ""normal ability""), and baseline cognitive function did not differ by treatment regimen (p = 0.350). Over 24 months, women reported minimal changes at each time point and insignificant differences by treatment arm were observed. In a healthy group of older women, chemotherapy was not associated with longitudinal changes in self-reported cognitive function.","['Freedman, Rachel A', 'Pitcher, Brandelyn', 'Keating, Nancy L', 'Ballman, Karla V', 'Mandelblatt, Jeanne', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Kimmick, Gretchen G', 'Hurria, Arti', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Hudis, Clifford A', 'Cohen, Harvey Jay', 'Muss, Hyman B']","['Freedman RA', 'Pitcher B', 'Keating NL', 'Ballman KV', 'Mandelblatt J', 'Kornblith AB', 'Kimmick GG', 'Hurria A', 'Winer EP', 'Hudis CA', 'Cohen HJ', 'Muss HB']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA. rafreedman@partners.org']",['eng'],"['R01 CA127617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA096940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129769/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA132378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129769/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA084131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA085850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 CA096940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 127617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA 84131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130517,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Capecitabine', '*Cognition', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC3920483,['NIHMS547648'],2013/05/18 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10549-013-2562-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2013 Jun;139(2):607-16. doi: 10.1007/s10549-013-2562-6.

The age of CML patients enrolled within controlled clinical studies is lower with respect to patients included in population-based registries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To describe the safety and tolerability of imatinib in very elderly CML patients in chronic phase, 211 chronic-phase CML patients aged >75 years were retrospectively analyzed using data collected from 31 institutions in Italy. RESULTS: The median age at imatinib start was 78.6 years [interquartile range (IR) 76.3-81.4], median time from diagnosis to imatinib start was 1.2 months (IR 0.5-3.7). The starting dose of imatinib was 400 mg/day in 144 patients (68.2 %), >400 mg/day in 4 patients (2.0 %), and <400 mg/day in 63 patients (29.8 %); overall, 94 patients (44.5 %) needed a dose reduction and 27 (12.7 %) discontinued imatinib for toxicity. Grade 3-4 hematologic and extrahematologic toxicities were observed in 40 (18.9 %) and 45 (21.3 %) patients, respectively. After a median observation of 29.8 months (IR 13.0-55.6), 203/211 patients had at least 6 months of observation on imatinib or discontinued before and were evaluable for response and outcome; of them, 183 patients (90.2 %) achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR). Among these 183 patients in CHR, 14 refused any other karyotypic or molecular evaluation, 24 achieved CHR only, and 145 (71.4 %) achieved a cytogenetic response (CyR) of any grade, which was complete (CCyR) in 129 (63.5 %). Among the 129 patients with CCyR, 95 (46.7 %) achieved a major molecular response (MMolR). By multivariate regression analysis, late chronic phase (p = 0.001) and grade 3-4 extrahematologic toxicity (p = 0.007) maintained a negative independent prognostic impact for CCyR, while late chronic phase (p = 0.026), grade 3-4 extrahematologic toxicity (p = 0.007), and lower initial dose of imatinib (p = 0.044) maintained a negative independent prognostic impact for MMolR. The 2-year and 4-year overall survival were 92.6 % (95 % CI 88.7-96.5) and 78.0 % (95 % CI 71.2-84.8), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this large cohort of patients show that no upper age limit should be applied for the administration of imatinib to patients with chronic-phase CML; the very elderly, including those with concomitant severe diseases, should be offered this treatment. The role of a reduced starting dose of imatinib warrants further studies.","['Latagliata, Roberto', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Mansueto, Giovanna', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Russo, Sabina', 'Cavalli, Laura', 'Montefusco, Enrico', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'Russo Rossi, Antonella', 'Avanzini, Paolo', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Mauro, Endri', 'Spadea, Antonio', 'Celesti, Francesca', 'Giglio, Gianfranco', 'Isidori, Alessandro', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Calistri, Elisabetta', 'Sora, Federica', 'Storti, Stefano', ""D'Addosio, Ada"", 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Latagliata R', 'Ferrero D', 'Iurlo A', 'Cavazzini F', 'Castagnetti F', 'Abruzzese E', 'Fava C', 'Breccia M', 'Annunziata M', 'Stagno F', 'Tiribelli M', 'Binotto G', 'Mansueto G', 'Gozzini A', 'Russo S', 'Cavalli L', 'Montefusco E', 'Gugliotta G', 'Cedrone M', 'Russo Rossi A', 'Avanzini P', 'Pregno P', 'Mauro E', 'Spadea A', 'Celesti F', 'Giglio G', 'Isidori A', 'Crugnola M', 'Calistri E', 'Sora F', 'Storti S', ""D'Addosio A"", 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Luciano L', 'Alimena G']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita, La Sapienza, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. rob.lati@libero.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aging', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40266-013-0088-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2013 Aug;30(8):629-37. doi: 10.1007/s40266-013-0088-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of all subsequent malignancies was 15- and 10-fold higher in males (SIR: 15.42) and in females (SIR: 10.55) with melanoma, than in the general population. The increased cancer risk resulted mainly from the significantly higher skin tumor development: SIR values were 160.39 and 92.64 for additional invasive melanoma and 342.28 and 77.04 for subsequent in situ melanoma in males and females, respectively. Non-melanoma skin cancers also notably contributed to the higher risk, the SIR was elevated in both genders to the same extent (males: 17.12, females: 17.55).

However, the molecular mechanisms rendering cancer cells but not normal cells particularly sensitive to disrupting IP3R/Bcl-2 complexes are poorly understood. Therefore, we studied the effect of TAT-IDP(S) in a more heterogeneous Bcl-2-dependent cancer model using a set of 'primed to death' diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DL-BCL) cell lines containing elevated Bcl-2 levels. We discovered a large heterogeneity in the apoptotic responses of these cells to TAT-IDP(S) with SU-DHL-4 being most sensitive and OCI-LY-1 being most resistant. This sensitivity strongly correlated with the ability of TAT-IDP(S) to promote IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) release. Although total IP3R-expression levels were very similar among SU-DHL-4 and OCI-LY-1, we discovered that the IP3R2-protein level was the highest for SU-DHL-4 and the lowest for OCI-LY-1. Strikingly, TAT-IDP(S)-induced Ca(2+) rise and apoptosis in the different DL-BCL cell lines strongly correlated with their IP3R2-protein level, but not with IP3R1-, IP3R3- or total IP3R-expression levels. Inhibiting or knocking down IP3R2 activity in SU-DHL-4-reduced TAT-IDP(S)-induced apoptosis, which is compatible with its ability to dissociate Bcl-2 from IP3R2 and to promote IP3-induced pro-apoptotic Ca(2+) signaling. Thus, certain chronically activated B-cell lymphoma cells are addicted to high Bcl-2 levels for their survival not only to neutralize pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members but also to suppress IP3R hyperactivity. In particular, cancer cells expressing high levels of IP3R2 are addicted to IP3R/Bcl-2 complex formation and disruption of these complexes using peptide tools results in pro-apoptotic Ca(2+) signaling and cell death.","['Akl, H', 'Monaco, G', 'La Rovere, R', 'Welkenhuyzen, K', 'Kiviluoto, S', 'Vervliet, T', 'Molgo, J', 'Distelhorst, C W', 'Missiaen, L', 'Mikoshiba, K', 'Parys, J B', 'De Smedt, H', 'Bultynck, G']","['Akl H', 'Monaco G', 'La Rovere R', 'Welkenhuyzen K', 'Kiviluoto S', 'Vervliet T', 'Molgo J', 'Distelhorst CW', 'Missiaen L', 'Mikoshiba K', 'Parys JB', 'De Smedt H', 'Bultynck G']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['R01 CA085804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism']",PMC3674349,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013140 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.140 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 May 16;4:e632. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Innate or acquired resistance to Fd is a significant clinical problem and is largely mediated by increased expression of BCL-2 family members. The antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins inhibit both apoptosis and autophagy, therefore, downregulation of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins and enhanced autophagy must coexist in cells dying in response to an apoptosis inducing therapeutic. However, in the drug-resistant cells that have an increased dependence on antiapoptotic proteins, whether autophagy is also inhibited remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of the BCL-2 family in regulating cell death and autophagy in leukemic cell lines and their derivative isogenic Fd-resistant (FdR) cells. MCL-1 degradation following Fd treatment freed the proapoptotic effectors BIM and BECN1, thus leading to cell death-associated autophagy in Fd-sensitive cells. However, in FdR cells, low BIM expression and BECN1 sequestration by MCL-1 prevented cell death. Consistently, in sensitive cells inhibition of apoptosis using siBIM and of both the early-phase autophagy nucleation steps by siBECN1, shATG7 or 3-methyladenine and the late-phase autophagy by shLAMP2, significantly reduced Fd-induced cell death. Paradoxically, FdR cells were addicted to basal autophagy, which was dependent on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) but not BECN1. Moreover, in FdR cells, inhibition of autophagy by shLAMP2, but not siBECN1, enhanced cell death. The BH3-mimetic obatoclax released BIM and BECN1 from MCL-1 in Fd-sensitive and BECN1 from MCL-1 in FdR cells, and was effective at killing both Fd-sensitive and - resistant leukemic cells, including primary CLL cells. Therefore, a differential regulation of autophagy through BECN1 and AMPK signaling in Fd-sensitive and - resistant cells determines the different possible outcomes of autophagy inhibition. These findings suggest effective means to overcome Fd resistance by induction of BIM-dependent apoptosis and activation of BECN1-dependent autophagy.","['Sharma, A', 'Singh, K', 'Mazumder, S', 'Hill, B T', 'Kalaycio, M', 'Almasan, A']","['Sharma A', 'Singh K', 'Mazumder S', 'Hill BT', 'Kalaycio M', 'Almasan A']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PC094405/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Beclin-1', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC3674362,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013155 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.155 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 May 16;4:e628. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.155.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) mutant mice with chronically low Cort levels showed aberrant HSPC regulation, having higher HSPC numbers and upregulation of the chemokine CXCL12, phenotypes that were restored by Cort supplementation. Expanded stromal progenitors known to support HSPCs were also observed in these low-Cort-containing mice. A similar phenotype was induced in wild-type (WT) mice by Metyrapone, a Cort synthesis inhibitor. Conversely, high Cort exposure induced HSPC apoptosis, reduced long-term BM repopulation and decreased stromal progenitor cell numbers. We documented circadian oscillations of Cort in WT BM but not in CRFR1 mutant mice, leading to diminished circadian BM CXCL12 fluctuations and increased number of circulating HSPCs in these mice. Finally, low Cort induced expansion of stromal progenitors, CXCL12 expression, HSPC proliferation and BM repopulation capacity, involving Notch1 signaling. This was associated with upregulation of the Notch ligand, Jagged1, in BM myeloid cells. Our results suggest that daily physiologic Cort oscillations are critical for balanced HSPC proliferation and function involving Notch1 signaling and their supportive BM microenvironment.","['Kollet, O', 'Vagima, Y', ""D'Uva, G"", 'Golan, K', 'Canaani, J', 'Itkin, T', 'Gur-Cohen, S', 'Kalinkovich, A', 'Caglio, G', 'Medaglia, C', 'Ludin, A', 'Lapid, K', 'Shezen, E', 'Neufeld-Cohen, A', 'Varol, D', 'Chen, A', 'Lapidot, T']","['Kollet O', 'Vagima Y', ""D'Uva G"", 'Golan K', 'Canaani J', 'Itkin T', 'Gur-Cohen S', 'Kalinkovich A', 'Caglio G', 'Medaglia C', 'Ludin A', 'Lapid K', 'Shezen E', 'Neufeld-Cohen A', 'Varol D', 'Chen A', 'Lapidot T']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130517,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '5CLY6W2H1M (CRF receptor type 1)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/*metabolism', 'Corticosterone/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013154 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.154 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):2006-15. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.154.

We first evaluated the clinical value of various positive MRD standards for accurately indicating relapse based on WT1 and FCM data in adult patients with acute leukemia (AL). In total, 824 AL patients treated with allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of diverse, multiple-criteria MRD prognostic standards based on WT1 and FCM assays. Higher sensitivity was achieved without a loss of specificity when MRDco+, which was defined as two consecutive WT10.6+ or FCM+ or both WT10.6+ and FCM+ in the same sample within a year posttransplantation, was used as the positive MRD standard. Similar results were observed, even in 484 patients who had both abnormal WT1 and LAIPs values before transplant. A multivariate analysis showed that MRDco+ was an independent risk factor for leukemia relapse after transplant in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The combined use of FCM and WT1 monitoring could distinguish between patients with low and high risks of relapse.

The beta-thymosins are a group of small acidic peptides involved in processes such as actin sequestration, neuronal development, wound healing, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. Recent characterization of the beta thymosins as immunological regulators in invertebrates led to our identification and characterization of a beta-thymosin homologue (Tbeta) from Haliotis discus discus. The cDNA possessed an ORF of 132 bp encoding a protein of 44 amino acids with a molecular mass of 4977 Da. The amino acid sequence shows high identity with another molluskan beta-thymosin and has a characteristic actin binding motif (LKKTET) and glutamyl donors. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with molluskan homologues, as well as its distinct identity and common ancestral origin. Genomic analysis revealed a 3 exon-2 intron structure similar to the other homologues. In silico promoter analysis also revealed significant transcription factor binding sites, providing evidence for the expression of this gene under different cellular conditions, including stress or pathogenic attack. Tissue distribution profiling revealed a ubiquitous presence in all the examined tissues, but with the highest expression in mantle and hemocyte.

In order to improve the rapidity and scalability of in vitro cytotoxicity assessment, we evaluated the efficacy of a protocol utilizing tetrameric antibody complexes and SepMate isolation tubes to negatively select NK cells (TACs/Sep), and calcein-AM release to measure cytotoxicity. We compared the efficiency and accuracy of this protocol to a conventional approach employing density gradient centrifugation and magnetically labeled antibodies (DG/MACS) to isolate NK cells and chromium release to measure cytotoxicity. The TACs/Sep method significantly decreased the time required for NK cell isolation (1h vs. 4h), but resulted in higher red blood cell contamination. NK cell activation marker expression (including CD94, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp46, DNAM-1, 2B4, KIR2DL1/S1, KIR2DL2/L3, intracellular granzyme B, and perforin) was similar when comparing NK cells isolated by the TACs/Sep or DG/MACS methods, but the TACs/Sep method induced higher expression of CD16. In vitro cytotoxicity against HT29 colon cancer and K562 leukemia cells was not affected by the isolation method. Lastly, by combining the TACs/Sep NK cell isolation method with calcein-acetoxymethyl diacetylester (calcein-AM) release, the time required to assess in vitro cytotoxicity was reduced by 33% (4h) compared to protocols employing DG/MACS and chromium release. Altogether, these results provide the foundation for the development of a rapid, high throughput functional assay, and make it practical for the multiplexing of downstream applications, such as flow cytometric analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).","['So, Edward C', 'Sallin, Michelle A', 'Zhang, Xiaoyu', 'Chan, Siaw L', 'Sahni, Lepakshi', 'Schulze, Dan H', 'Davila, Eduardo', 'Strome, Scott E', 'Jain, Ajay']","['So EC', 'Sallin MA', 'Zhang X', 'Chan SL', 'Sahni L', 'Schulze DH', 'Davila E', 'Strome SE', 'Jain A']","['Division of Research and Development and Surgical Service, Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center, 10 N.

Amplicons were designed targeting RUNX1, CEBPA, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, DNMT3A, EZH2, and TP53 using different PCR amplification strategies and Roche GS FLX Titanium and Illumina MiSeq sequencing platforms. Thirty-three patients with leukemia were selected as an exemplary cohort representing heterogeneous cancer specimens. Both standard two-primer amplification and four-primer microfluidics PCRs yielded highly linear characteristics in detecting molecular alterations in series of dilution experiments. By fitting a linear mixed-effects model to the logarithmized data, a slope beta of -1.000 (95% CI, +/-0.046) was obtained for two-primer assays and of -0.998 (95% CI, +/-0.105) was obtained for four-primer assays, which represented a near-perfect decrease of the mutation load. Furthermore, data are presented on technical precision, limit of detection, and occurrence of small subclones in TP53- and RUNX1-mutated patients to identify clonal disease progression and residual disease. We demonstrate that, depending on the local sequence context for each amplicon, the limit of detection of the assay cannot be lower than a range of 0.25% to 3.5%. In conclusion, amplicon deep sequencing enabled the assessment of mutations in a highly robust manner and across a broad range of relative frequencies of mutations. This assay detects residual disease or identifies mutations with predictive relevance to direct treatment strategies.","['Grossmann, Vera', 'Roller, Andreas', 'Klein, Hans-Ulrich', 'Weissmann, Sandra', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Kohlmann, Alexander']","['Grossmann V', 'Roller A', 'Klein HU', 'Weissmann S', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach C', 'Dugas M', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S', 'Kohlmann A']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130514,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['DNA Primers/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2014/02/14 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(13)00057-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2013 Jul;15(4):473-84. doi: 10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.03.003.

We designed the BH3 alpha-helix mimetic JY-1-106 to engage the hydrophobic BH3-binding grooves on the surfaces of both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. METHODS: JY-1-106-protein complexes were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the SILCS methodology. We have evaluated the in vitro effects of JY-1-106 by using a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay, an XTT assay, apoptosis assays, and immunoprecipitation and western-blot assays. A preclinical human cancer xenograft model was used to test the efficacy of JY-1-106 in vivo. RESULTS: MD and SILCS simulations of the JY-1-106-protein complexes indicated the importance of the aliphatic side chains of JY-1-106 to binding and successfully predicted the improved affinity of the ligand for Bcl-xL over Mcl-1. Ligand binding affinities were measured via an FP assay using a fluorescently labeled Bak-BH3 peptide in vitro. Apoptosis induction via JY-1-106 was evidenced by TUNEL assay and PARP cleavage as well as by Bax-Bax dimerization. Release of multi-domain Bak from its inhibitory binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 using JY-1-106 was detected via immunoprecipitation (IP) western blotting.At the cellular level, we compared the growth proliferation IC50s of JY-1-106 and ABT-737 in multiple cancer cell lines with various Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression levels. JY-1-106 effectively induced cell death regardless of the Mcl-1 expression level in ABT-737 resistant solid tumor cells, whilst toxicity toward normal human endothelial cells was limited. Furthermore, synergistic effects were observed in A549 cells using a combination of JY-1-106 and multiple chemotherapeutic agents. We also observed that JY-1-106 was a very effective agent in inducing apoptosis in metabolically stressed tumors. Finally, JY-1-106 was evaluated in a tumor-bearing nude mouse model, and was found to effectively repress tumor growth. Strong TUNEL signals in the tumor cells demonstrated the effectiveness of JY-1-106 in this animal model. No significant side effects were observed in mouse organs after multiple injections. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these observations demonstrate that JY-1-106 is an effective pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor with very promising clinical potential.","['Cao, Xiaobo', 'Yap, Jeremy L', 'Newell-Rogers, M Karen', 'Peddaboina, Chander', 'Jiang, Weihua', 'Papaconstantinou, Harry T', 'Jupitor, Dan', 'Rai, Arun', 'Jung, Kwan-Young', 'Tubin, Richard P', 'Yu, Wenbo', 'Vanommeslaeghe, Kenno', 'Wilder, Paul T', 'MacKerell, Alexander D Jr', 'Fletcher, Steven', 'Smythe, Roy W']","['Cao X', 'Yap JL', 'Newell-Rogers MK', 'Peddaboina C', 'Jiang W', 'Papaconstantinou HT', 'Jupitor D', 'Rai A', 'Jung KY', 'Tubin RP', 'Yu W', 'Vanommeslaeghe K', 'Wilder PT', 'MacKerell AD Jr', 'Fletcher S', 'Smythe RW']","['Department of Surgery, Scott & White Memorial Hospital and Clinic, The Texas A&M University System, Health Science Center, College of Medicine, 702 SW HK Dodgen Loop, Temple, Texas 76504, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130516,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (JY-1-106)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (para-Aminobenzoates)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mesothelioma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism', 'para-Aminobenzoates/*pharmacology']",PMC3663763,,2013/05/18 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-42 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 May 16;12(1):42. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If patients from regional areas remain in hospital longer because of logistical issues such as transport and accommodation, then there is an argument for establishing or expanding appropriate medical services for rural areas. However, if the length of stay (LOS) for rural and urban patients is similar, it could be surmised that current logistic services appropriately meet demand. METHODS: This study reviews the cases of 40 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. This disease was selected as patients are generally required to travel to a metropolitan hospital for treatment, regardless of location. Twenty patients resided within the Sydney metropolitan area and 20 lived in rural New South Wales. Each of the 20 metropolitan patients were case-matched (1:1) with 20 rural patients with reference to sex, specific acute myeloid leukemia subtype (by World Health Organisation ICD-10 classification), and age. RESULTS: Following statistical non-parametric (t-test) analysis, rural and urban medians were found to be very similar with a high t-value and small mean (urban median=29, rural median=29.5, t-value=0.722, m=-0.95, s.d.=15.236, two-tailed P=0.789, 95% CI=-7.89, 5.99). This demonstrates that there was no statistically significant difference between mean LOS for rural or urban patients after case-matching, a conclusion supported by qualitative analysis of the data. CONCLUSION: Logistical issues are therefore unlikely to keep rural patients with AML in hospital beyond their immediate medical treatment. What is known about this topic? A United States-based study found that LOS in hospital for rural patients with human immunodeficiency virus was one-third longer than for urban patients across each of the 6 years analysed (from 1998 to 2003). However it was noted that after adjusting for covariates such as age and sex, differences between LOS for rural and urban residents were not of statistical significance. What does this paper add? This paper provides evidence that current services are utilised appropriately by demonstrating that rural and urban patients spend on average the same amount of time in hospital. Factors such as lack of transport or accommodation are therefore unlikely to keep rural patients in hospital beyond their immediate medical requirements. This paper adds to the limited research base within the Australian context. What are the implications for practitioners? It appears that support organisations adequately fulfil the needs of rural patients in the discharge process. LOS does not appear to correlate with the distance of residence from hospital. Practitioners should continue to support and encourage such support networks.","['Heinz, Sean J', 'Milliken, Sam']","['Heinz SJ', 'Milliken S']","['Nepean Hospital, Penrith, Australia. sean.heinz@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Australia,Aust Health Rev,Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,8214381,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Rural/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Urban/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'New South Wales', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transportation of Patients/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Travel/statistics & numerical data']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['AH13021 [pii]', '10.1071/AH13021 [doi]']",ppublish,Aust Health Rev. 2013 Jun;37(3):397-401. doi: 10.1071/AH13021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When administered at pharmacologic levels, both GCV and ATO reduced tumor growth while co-treatment with GCV + ATO resulted in a diminution of tumor volume. Treatment with GCV or ATO individually resulted in an increased number of apoptotic cells while co-treatment with GCV + ATO synergistically induced apoptosis.

With the aim to identify new lead compounds for anti-CML drugs, we carried out a structure-based de novo design using the scoring function improved by implementing an accurate solvation free energy term. This approach led to the identification of ABL inhibitors equipotent for the wild type and the most drug-resistant T315I mutant of ABL at the picomolar level. Decomposition analysis of the binding free energy showed that a decrease in the desolvation cost for binding in the ATP-binding site could be as important as the strengthening of enzyme-inhibitor interaction to enhance the potency of an ABL inhibitor with structural modifications. A similar energetic feature was also observed in free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. Consistent with the previous experimental and computational studies, the hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone groups of Met318 proved to be the most significant binding forces to stabilize the inhibitors in the ATP-binding sites of the wild type and T315I mutant. The results of molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the dynamic stabilities of the hydrogen bonds between the inhibitors and Met318 should also be considered in designing the potent common inhibitors of the wild-type and T315I mutant of ABL.","['Park, Hwangseo', 'Hong, Seunghee', 'Kim, Jinhee', 'Hong, Sungwoo']","['Park H', 'Hong S', 'Kim J', 'Hong S']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Sejong University , Seoul 143-747, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130524,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Discovery', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja311756u [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2013 Jun 5;135(22):8227-37. doi: 10.1021/ja311756u.

These chromosomal rearrangements result in fusion of the protein MLL to one of more than 60 protein partners. MLL fusions are potent inducers of leukemia through activation of oncogene expression; therefore, targeting this transcriptional activation function may arrest MLL-rearranged (MLL-R) leukemia. Leukemic cell lines harboring the most common fusion protein, MLL-AF4, require the direct interaction of AF4 with the transcription factor AF9 to survive and self-renew; disrupting this interaction with a cell-penetrating AF4-derived peptide results in cell death, suggesting that the AF4-AF9 interaction could be a viable target for a novel MLL-R leukemia therapy. Here we describe the use of AlphaScreen technology to develop a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to detect nonpeptidic inhibitors of AF4-AF9 binding. The assay is economical, requiring only low nanomolar concentrations of biotinylated AF4-derived peptide and FLAG-tagged AF9 in low-volume 384-well plates. A Z'-factor of 0.71 and a signal-to-background ratio of 21.3 showed the assay to be robust, and sensitivity to inhibition was demonstrated with competing AF4-derived peptides. Two pilot screens comprising 5,680 compounds served as validation for HTS at Nemours and the Broad Institute. Assay artifacts were excluded using a counterscreen comprising a biotinylated FLAG peptide. This is the first reported HTS-compatible assay to identify compounds that inhibit a key binding interaction of an MLL fusion partner, and the results presented here demonstrate suitability for screening large chemical libraries in high-density, low-volume plate formats.","['Watson, Venita Gresham', 'Drake, Katherine M', 'Peng, Yu', 'Napper, Andrew D']","['Watson VG', 'Drake KM', 'Peng Y', 'Napper AD']","['High-Throughput Screening and Drug Discovery Lab, Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.']",['eng'],['R21 NS073046/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Assay Drug Dev Technol,Assay and drug development technologies,101151468,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors']",PMC3656630,,2013/05/18 06:00,2014/01/09 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/adt.2012.495 [doi]'],ppublish,Assay Drug Dev Technol. 2013 May;11(4):253-68. doi: 10.1089/adt.2012.495.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Treg cells were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from the newly diagnosed DBLCL patients. The concentration of sCD25 in the supernatant was determined with a commercial sCD25 (IL-2R) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The fluorescence intensity of CD25 was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Cell survival rate was significantly decreased along with the increase of epirubicin concentration after treatment for 24 h. There was also a significant difference in the concentration of sCD25 between the epirubicin group and the control group (P<0.01). A positive correlation between the Treg cells survival rate and the concentration of sCD25 was detected (r=0.993, P<0.01). When equal numbers of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells of the epirubicin group and the control group were cultured for another 24 h without epirubicin the CD25 fluorescence intensity on the surface of Treg cells was obviously higher in the epirubicin group than that in the control group (P<0.01), while the sCD25 concentration in the supernatant in the epirubicin group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05).

Ligands for human NKG2D comprise two groups of MHC class I-related molecules, the MHC class I chain-related proteins A and B (MICA/B) and 6 UL16-binding proteins (ULBP1-6). While NKG2D ligands are absent from most normal cells, expression is induced upon stress and malignant transformation. In fact, most solid tumours and leukaemia/lymphomas constitutively express at least one NKG2D ligand and thereby are susceptible to NKG2D-dependent immunosurveillance. However, soluble NKG2D ligands are released from tumour cells and can down-modulate NKG2D activation as a means of tumour immune escape. In some tumour entities, levels of soluble NKG2D ligands in the serum correlate with tumour progression. NKG2D ligands can be proteolytically shed from the cell surface or liberated from the membrane by phospholipase C in the case of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules. Moreover, NKG2D ligands can be secreted in exosomal microvesicles together with other tumour-derived molecules. Depending on the specific tumour/immune cell setting, these various forms of soluble and/or exosome-bound NKG2D ligands can exert multiple effects on NKG2D/NKG2D ligand interactions. In this review, we focus on the role of various proteases in the shedding of human NKG2D ligands from tumour cells and discuss the not completely unanimous reported functional implications of soluble and exosome-secreted NKG2D ligands for immunosurveillance.","['Chitadze, G', 'Bhat, J', 'Lettau, M', 'Janssen, O', 'Kabelitz, D']","['Chitadze G', 'Bhat J', 'Lettau M', 'Janssen O', 'Kabelitz D']","['Institute of Immunology, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (MICB antigen)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Exosomes/*metabolism', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteolysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/sji.12072 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2013 Aug;78(2):120-9. doi: 10.1111/sji.12072.,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diagnosed at 3 years of age. Subsequent to discontinuing his psychotropic medication, the patient's mental status deteriorated and treatment with midazolam for 3 weeks was necessary to allow the completion of the leukemia induction regimen. On day 51, although there was no indication of thrombocytopenia or a coagulation disorder, the patient began to hemorrhage suddenly from anal with resulting hypovolemic shock, and large-volume blood transfusion was initiated. Although upper and lower endoscopy failed to determine the location of the hemorrhage, angiography enabled us to determine that it was a branch of the SMA (the middle colic artery #6), and selective arterial embolization was used to arrest the bleeding. There could have been underlying causes, such as, a probable malformation or aneurysm in that area, although there was no indication before or after the event.

Although the familiarization and dependency of mobile phones is growing at an alarming pace, the biological effects due to the exposure of radiations have become a subject of intense debate. The present evidence on mobile phone radiation exposure is based on scientific research and public policy initiative to give an overview of what is known of biological effects that occur at radiofrequency (RF)/ electromagnetic fields (EMFs) exposure. The conflict in conclusions is mainly because of difficulty in controlling the affecting parameters. Biological effects are dependent not only on the distance and size of the object (with respect to the object) but also on the environmental parameters. Health endpoints reported to be associated with RF include childhood leukemia, brain tumors, genotoxic effects, neurological effects and neurodegenerative diseases, immune system deregulation, allergic and inflammatory responses, infertility and some cardiovascular effects. Most of the reports conclude a reasonable suspicion of mobile phone risk that exists based on clear evidence of bio-effects which with prolonged exposures may reasonably be presumed to result in health impacts. The present study summarizes the public issue based on mobile phone radiation exposure and their biological effects. This review concludes that the regular and long term use of microwave devices (mobile phone, microwave oven) at domestic level can have negative impact upon biological system especially on brain. It also suggests that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role by enhancing the effect of microwave radiations which may cause neurodegenerative diseases.","['Kesari, Kavindra Kumar', 'Siddiqui, Mohd Haris', 'Meena, Ramovatar', 'Verma, H N', 'Kumar, Shivendra']","['Kesari KK', 'Siddiqui MH', 'Meena R', 'Verma HN', 'Kumar S']",['kavindra_biotech@yahoo.co.in'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,India,Indian J Exp Biol,Indian journal of experimental biology,0233411,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biophysics/methods', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Phone', 'Central Nervous System/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagens', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis', 'Radiometry', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",,,2013/05/18 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/05/18 06:00'],"['2013/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Indian J Exp Biol. 2013 Mar;51(3):187-200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is catabolized to 6-thiouric acid (6TUA) through 8-hydroxo-6-mercaptopurine (8OH6MP) or 6-thioxanthine (6TX) intermediates. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is usually used to determine the contents of therapeutic drugs, metabolites and other important biomedical analytes in biological samples. In the present study, the multivariate calibration methods, partial least squares (PLS-1) and principle component regression (PCR) have been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of 6MP and its oxidative metabolites (6TUA, 8OH6MP and 6TX) without analyte separation in spiked human plasma. Mixtures of 6MP, 8-8OH6MP, 6TX and 6TUA have been resolved by PLS-1 and PCR to their UV spectra. RESULTS: Recoveries (%) obtained for 6MP, 8-8OH6MP, 6TX and 6TUA were 94.5-97.5, 96.6-103.3, 95.1-96.9 and 93.4-95.8, respectively, using PLS-1 and 96.7-101.3, 96.2-98.8, 95.8-103.3 and 94.3-106.1, respectively, using PCR. The NAS (Net analyte signal) concept was used to calculate multivariate analytical figures of merit such as limit of detection (LOD), selectivity and sensitivity. The limit of detections for 6MP, 8-8OH6MP, 6TX and 6TUA were calculated to be 0.734, 0.439, 0.797 and 0.482 mumol L-1, respectively, using PLS and 0.724, 0.418, 0783 and 0.535 mumol L-1, respectively, using PCR. HPLC was also applied as a validation method for simultaneous determination of these thiopurines in the synthetic solutions and human plasma. CONCLUSION: Combination of spectroscopic techniques and chemometric methods (PLS and PCR) has provided a simple but powerful method for simultaneous analysis of multicomponent mixtures.","['Sorouraddin, Mohammad-Hossein', 'Khani, Mohammad-Yaser', 'Amini, Kaveh', 'Naseri, Abdolhossein', 'Asgari, Davoud', 'Rashidi, Mohammad-Reza']","['Sorouraddin MH', 'Khani MY', 'Amini K', 'Naseri A', 'Asgari D', 'Rashidi MR']","['Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, 51666-16471, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110609,Iran,Bioimpacts,BioImpacts : BI,101558125,,,,PMC3648948,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2013/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5681/bi.2011.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioimpacts. 2011;1(1):53-62. doi: 10.5681/bi.2011.008.

We hypothesized that patients with more severe toxicity may experience abnormal macrophage activation triggered by the release of cytokines by T-cell receptor-activated cytotoxic T cells engaged by BiTE antibodies and leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We prospectively monitored a patient during blinatumomab treatment and observed that he developed HLH. He became ill 36 hours into the infusion with fever, respiratory failure, and circulatory collapse. He developed hyperferritinemia, cytopenias, hypofibrinogenemia, and a cytokine profile diagnostic for HLH.

Nilotinib is an orally available receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for chronic myelogenous leukemia. This study investigated the effect of nilotinib on HCC. Nilotinib did not induce cellular apoptosis. Instead, staining with acridine orange and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 revealed that nilotinib induced autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HCC cell lines, including PLC5, Huh-7, and Hep3B. Moreover, nilotinib up-regulated the phosphryaltion of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and protein phosphatase PP2A inactivation were detected after nilotinib treatment. Up-regulating PP2A activity suppressed nilotinib-induced AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy, suggesting that PP2A mediates the effect of nilotinib on AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy. Our data indicate that nilotinib-induced AMPK activation is mediated by PP2A, and AMPK activation and subsequent autophagy might be a major mechanism of action of nilotinib. Growth of PLC5 tumor xenografts in BALB/c nude mice was inhibited by daily oral treatment with nilotinib. Western blot analysis showed both increased phospho-AMPK expression and decreased PP2A activity in vivo. Together, our results reveal that nilotinib induces autophagy, but not apoptosis in HCC, and that the autophagy-inducing activity is associated with PP2A-regulated AMPK phosphorylation.","['Yu, Hui-Chuan', 'Lin, Chen-Si', 'Tai, Wei-Tien', 'Liu, Chun-Yu', 'Shiau, Chung-Wai', 'Chen, Kuen-Feng']","['Yu HC', 'Lin CS', 'Tai WT', 'Liu CY', 'Shiau CW', 'Chen KF']","['Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei 100, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130515,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3689967,,2013/05/17 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2013/05/17 06:00'],"['2013/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45814-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.446385 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Jun 21;288(25):18249-59. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.446385.

Previous studies have found that older AML patients, constituting the majority of the AML population, generally have poor outcomes, high healthcare expenditures, and median survival of <3 months. Because up-to-date information on treatment patterns, survival trends, and costs of care for elderly AML patients are lacking in the literature, we examined Medicare fee-for-service enrollees with primary AML to update these estimates and report on changes in treatment for this population. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to examine real-world data on treatment patterns, survival, and costs in elderly patients with primary AML. Factors associated with receipt of chemotherapy and with mortality also were assessed. METHODS: This is a retrospective database analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry and linked Medicare claims. Patients aged 65 years and older, who were newly diagnosed with AML between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2007 were selected if they had no previous neoplasm or hematological disease. Patients were followed until death or to the end of the observation period (31 December 2007). Study measures included chemotherapy and supportive care (SC) received, survival time, and all-cause healthcare utilization and costs accrued from AML diagnosis until death or observation period end. Regression analyses assessed factors associated with receipt of chemotherapy (logistic) and mortality among chemotherapy and SC users (Cox). RESULTS: Of the 4,058 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 43 % received chemotherapy; 57 % received SC only. Among patients receiving chemotherapy, 69.1 % died within 1 year; median survival was 7.0 months. Among patients receiving only SC, 95.0 % died within 1 year; median survival was 1.5 months. The most significant factors associated with receipt of chemotherapy were patient age [odds ratio (OR) = 0.420 among patients 75-84 years and 0.099 among patients 85+ years, compared with patients aged 65-74 years) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (OR = 0.614 for patients with a CCI = 2 or 3 and 0.707 for patients with a CCI >3, compared with patients with a CCI = 0) (all P < 0.001). The most significant factors associated with mortality among patients receiving chemotherapy were patient age [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.321 among patients 75-84 years and 1.832 among patients 85+ years, compared with patients aged 65-74 years] and CCI score (OR = 1.287 for patients with a CCI = 2 or 3 and 1.220 for patients with a CCI >3, compared with patients with a CCI = 0) (all P < 0.01). Mean (standard deviation) all-cause healthcare costs were $96,078 ($109,072); the largest component was inpatient utilization (76.3 %). CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients with fewer comorbidities were more likely to receive chemotherapy and had longer survival. AML is associated with a substantial economic burden, and treatment outcomes appear to be suboptimal, with limited therapy options currently available.","['Meyers, Juliana', 'Yu, Yanni', 'Kaye, James A', 'Davis, Keith L']","['Meyers J', 'Yu Y', 'Kaye JA', 'Davis KL']","['RTI Health Solutions, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA. jmeyers@rti.org']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Applied health economics and health policy,101150314,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Drug Therapy/economics', 'Fee-for-Service Plans/*economics', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*economics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Medicare/*economics', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*economics/statistics & numerical data"", 'Resource Allocation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",,,2013/05/17 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2013/05/17 06:00'],"['2013/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40258-013-0032-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2013 Jun;11(3):275-86. doi: 10.1007/s40258-013-0032-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach led to the discovery of the Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) integration site-1 (fli-1). Viral insertion at the fli-1 locus induces erythroleukemia in susceptible strains of mice. Our recent data demonstrated that, F-MuLV-infected SCID mice, in contrast to wt CB17 controls, developed a nonerythroleukemic leukemia without viral integration at the fli-1 locus. Using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) approach we identified a total of 15 viral integration sites in F-MuLV-infected SCID mice. One of the identified insertion sites was located about 62 kb upstream of the myeloblastosis (myb) gene. While integration within or surrounding the myb gene has been reported before for murine leukemia viruses, the location of the viral integration site identified in F-MuLVinfected SCID mice is novel and has never been reported. Using PCR analysis we showed that viral integration at the myb locus occurs with a frequency of 35% and therefore is considered as a common integration site. Integration of F-MuLV in this locus resulted in upregulation of the MYB protein. Flow cytometry analysis and methylcellulose culture of leukemic cells isolated from tumors with viral integration close to the myb indicated tumors of myeloid origin. Our findings indicate that, in contrast to wt CB17 mice, F-MuLV-infected SCID mice display viral integration within myeloid specific gene loci that result in the development of myelogenous leukemia.","['Haeri, Mehran', 'Li, Youjun', 'Li, Yanmei', 'Li, Qi', 'Spaner, David E', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Haeri M', 'Li Y', 'Li Y', 'Li Q', 'Spaner DE', 'Ben-David Y']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['MOP110952/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130516,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mybl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",,,2013/05/17 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2013/05/17 06:00'],"['2013/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.1943 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2013 Jul;43(1):169-76. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.1943.

We report an 18-year-old female with isolated renal relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia accompanied by polycythemia. At the relapse, she presented with bilateral nephromegaly, mild renal dysfunction, and erythrocytosis with increased serum EPO levels up to 52.1 mIU/mL (9.1-32.8). Renal biopsy demonstrated diffuse lymphoblastic infiltration. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, which is undetectable in normal kidney, was observed in the renal tubule epithelium compressed by lymphoblastic cells. These findings suggest that erythrocytosis was caused by renal ischemia due to leukemic infiltration. Polycythemia probably became apparent because of the lack of leukemic involvement of the bone marrow. With chemotherapy, the serum EPO level rapidly decreased to normal range accompanied by the normalization of kidney size and function. Renal leukemic infiltration may enhance EPO production, although not recognized in the majority of cases because of bone marrow involvement. CONCLUSION: Our case has clarified the mechanism of previously reported polycythemia associated with renal diseases as renal ischemia. Furthermore, we have added renal ischemia resulting from tumor infiltration to the list of causes of secondary polycythemia.","['Osumi, Tomoo', 'Awazu, Midori', 'Fujimura, Eriko', 'Yamazaki, Fumito', 'Hashiguchi, Akinori', 'Shimada, Hiroyuki']","['Osumi T', 'Awazu M', 'Fujimura E', 'Yamazaki F', 'Hashiguchi A', 'Shimada H']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130516,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Ischemia/*etiology/metabolism', 'Kidney/*blood supply/metabolism/pathology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Polycythemia/*etiology/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Recurrence']",,,2013/05/17 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/05/17 06:00'],"['2013/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00431-013-2030-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2013 Jun;172(6):829-32. doi: 10.1007/s00431-013-2030-7.

This material can be the basis for analyzing the temporal trend of outcomes. Our study was designed as a meta-regression focused on temporal trends and based on the endpoint of 5-year leukemia-free survival (5yLFS). Studies in which 5yLFS was determined in a patient group subjected to allogeneic transplant and in a control group (treated with autologous transplant and/or chemotherapy) were eligible for our meta-analysis. A standard literature search was carried out to identify pertinent studies. The results of included studies were submitted to an observational meta-analysis and to a meta-regression focused on two covariates (calendar year in which the study was conducted; percentage of high-risk patients). The endpoint of 5yLFS was separately assessed between allogeneic transplant and autologous transplant or chemotherapy. Our analysis included 14 studies that covered a period (1983 to 1999) in which patients were conditioned only with myeloablative conditioning and not with non-myeloablative ones. In the risk ratio (RR) analysis, the pooled outcome showed a significantly better profile for allogeneic transplantation (RR = 1.42; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.22 to 1.65). Separate analysis of the two treatment options found a pooled 5yLFS of 45 % (95 % CI, 38 to 51 %) for allogeneic transplant vs 30 % (95 % CI, 23 to 37 %) for the controls. In meta-regression, the temporal trend analysis revealed that, in patients subjected to allogeneic transplant, the values of 5yLFS showed no significant change over the 16-year interval (p = 0.720); the same stability over time was found in the control group (p = 0.489). On the other hand, the percentage of high-risk patients influenced outcomes in both patient groups at levels of statistical significance (p = 0.014 and p = 0.045 in the allotransplant group and in the controls, respectively). Our results can represent a reference point for future analyses focused on patients treated in more recent years.","['Messori, Andrea', 'Fadda, Valeria', 'Maratea, Dario', 'Trippoli, Sabrina']","['Messori A', 'Fadda V', 'Maratea D', 'Trippoli S']","['HTA Unit, ESTAV Toscana Centro, Regional Health Service, 50100, Firenze, Italy. andrea.messori.it@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20130516,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/17 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1766-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Sep;92(9):1221-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1766-5.

At our institution, cytarabine, etoposide and busulfan are used in first or second remission patients treated with a two-step approach to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathway genes of these drugs are associated with DFS in AML patients. A total of 1659 variants in 42 genes were analyzed for their association with DFS using a Cox-proportional hazards model. One hundred and fifty-four genetically European patients were used for the primary analysis. An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ABCC3 (rs4148405) was associated with a significantly shorter DFS (hazard ratios (HR)=3.2, P=5.6 x 10(-6)) in our primary cohort. In addition, a SNP in the GSTM1-GSTM5 locus, rs3754446, was significantly associated with a shorter DFS in all patients (HR=1.8, P=0.001 for 154 European ancestry; HR=1.7, P=0.028 for 125 non-European patients).

Sets of genes and lncRNAs significantly differentially expressed (>1.5 fold-change; q value </=10%) were identified. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis pointed to a number of functions, canonical pathways and gene networks that were significantly enriched with differentially expressed genes.

The microenvironment that surrounds leukemia cells plays a central role in this process. We report a patient with mixed phenotype acute leukemia with MLLT3-MLL. This patient, a 44-year-old woman, initially exhibited extramedullary leukemia with multiple tumors and subsequently developed bone marrow disease. The leukemia cells exhibited myeloid (CD13 and MPO) and B cell (CD19 and CD79a) phenotypes. Chromosomal analysis and RT-PCR assay revealed tumor cells with the MLLT3-MLL fusion gene.

Microarray analysis of OCI-AML3 cells revealed that the miRNA let-7a was downregulated by SDF-1alpha-mediated CXCR4 activation and increased by CXCR4 inhibition. Overexpression of let-7a in AML cell lines was associated with decreased c-Myc and BCL-XL protein expression and enhanced chemosensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo. We identified the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) as a link between SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 signaling and let-7a, as YY1 was upregulated by SDF-1alpha and downregulated by treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist. ChIP assay confirmed the binding of YY1 to unprocessed let-7a DNA fragments, and treatment with YY1 shRNA increased let-7a expression. In primary human AML samples, high CXCR4 expression was associated with low let-7a levels. Xenografts of primary human AML cells engineered to overexpress let-7a exhibited enhanced sensitivity to cytarabine, resulting in greatly extended survival of immunodeficient mice. Based on these data, we propose that CXCR4 induces chemoresistance by downregulating let-7a to promote YY1-mediated transcriptional activation of MYC and BCLXL in AML cells.","['Chen, Ye', 'Jacamo, Rodrigo', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Croce, Carlo', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Chen Y', 'Jacamo R', 'Konopleva M', 'Garzon R', 'Croce C', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA143805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA143805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA155056-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130508,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (YY1 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL12/physiology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Burden', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'YY1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3668829,,2013/05/17 06:00,2013/08/03 06:00,['2013/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['66553 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI66553 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2013 Jun;123(6):2395-407. doi: 10.1172/JCI66553.

Furthermore, most experimental strategies to separate GVHD and GVT responses merely spare GVT function without actually enhancing it. We have previously shown that endogenously expressed TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is required for optimal GVT activity against certain malignancies in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In order to model a donor-derived cellular therapy, we genetically engineered T cells to overexpress TRAIL and adoptively transferred donor-type unsorted TRAIL+ T cells into mouse models of allo-HSCT. We found that murine TRAIL+ T cells induced apoptosis of alloreactive T cells, thereby reducing GVHD in a DR5-dependent manner. Furthermore, murine TRAIL+ T cells mediated enhanced in vitro and in vivo antilymphoma GVT response. Moreover, human TRAIL+ T cells mediated enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity against both human leukemia cell lines and against freshly isolated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells.

Selective inhibition of PI3Kdelta (p110delta) by GS-1101 has emerged as a promising therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent lymphomas. In aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas such as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), however, efficacy has been observed, but the extent and duration of tumor control is modest. To determine if tumor killing by GS-1101 is cell cycle-dependent, we show in primary MCL cells by whole-transcriptome sequencing that, despite aberrant expression and recurrent mutations in Cyclin D1, mutations are rare in coding regions of CDK4, RB1 and other genes that control G1-S cell cycle progression or PI3K/AKT signaling. PI3Kdelta is the predominant PI3K catalytic subunit expressed, and inhibition by GS-1101 transiently inhibits AKT phosphorylation but not proliferation in MCL cells. Induction of prolonged early G1-arrest (pG1) by selective inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 with PD 0332991 amplifies and sustains PI3Kdelta inhibition, which leads to robust apoptosis. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3Kdelta induces apoptosis of primary MCL tumor cells once they have ceased to cycle ex vivo, and this killing is enhanced by PD 0332991 inhibition of CDK4/CDK6. PIK3IP1, a negative PI3K regulator, appears to mediate pG1 sensitization to PI3K inhibition; it is markedly reduced in MCL tumor cells compared with normal peripheral B cells, profoundly induced in pG1 and required for pG1 sensitization to GS-1101. Thus, the magnitude and duration of PI3K inhibition and tumor killing by GS-1101 is pG1-dependent, suggesting induction of pG1 by CDK4/CDK6 inhibition as a strategy to sensitize proliferating lymphoma cells to PI3K inhibition.","['Chiron, David', 'Martin, Peter', 'Di Liberto, Maurizio', 'Huang, Xiangao', 'Ely, Scott', 'Lannutti, Brian J', 'Leonard, John P', 'Mason, Christopher E', 'Chen-Kiang, Selina']","['Chiron D', 'Martin P', 'Di Liberto M', 'Huang X', 'Ely S', 'Lannutti BJ', 'Leonard JP', 'Mason CE', 'Chen-Kiang S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['UL1 TR000457/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI R01120531/PHS HHS/United States', 'R44HG005297/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130515,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PIK3IP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology']",PMC3735703,,2013/05/17 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/05/17 06:00'],"['2013/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['24928 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.24928 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Jun 15;12(12):1892-900. doi: 10.4161/cc.24928.

This is a complex process involving multiple signal transduction cascades which control the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation through transcriptional networks. Key activators/regulators of self-renewal include chemokines, cytokines and morphogens which are expressed in the bone marrow niche, either in a paracrine or autocrine fashion, and modulate stem cell behaviour. Increasing evidence suggests that the downstream signaling pathways induced by these ligands converge at multiple levels providing a degree of redundancy in steady state hematopoiesis.

Currently, several Hh pathway inhibitory drugs are in clinical development, and the FDA recently approved Erivedge (vismodegib) from Curis/Genentech [11-15]. These new drugs are effective in many, but not all patients [16]. In fact there are documented reports of tumors developing mutations that confer resistance to the drugs [14, 17-19]. This highlights the importance of finding second generation drugs that can be used on cancers that develop resistance to the first generation Hh inhibitors. Botanicals may serve as the backbone for such research. The gold-standard pathway inhibitor, cyclopamine, is itself a naturally occurring alkaloid found in Veratrum californicum [20]. In this review we will summarize the available literature on botanical compounds in Hh-related studies. In particular we will look at curcumin, genistein, EGCG, resveratrol, quercetin, baicalen, and apigenin along with novel compounds isolated from Southeast Asian plants, such as the potent sub-micromolar gitoxigenin derivatives.

In ATR FTIR mode, the penetration depth is controlled by both the wavelength and the incident angle, allowing depth profiling of samples. In this paper we took advantage of the ATR capability to modulate the penetration depth of the infrared wave into the cell, by modulating the incident angle, to investigate the differences between K562 multiresistant cells and their sensitive counterparts (wild-type K562 cells) as a function of this penetration depth. It is shown that focusing the IR beam on the most discriminant depth allows improvement of the discrimination between multiresistant and sensitive K562 cells.

PURPOSE: To study the impact of pretreatment BCR-ABL transcript level on molecular response to IM, and to assess the value of the milestone ; </=10% transcript at 3 months on PFS and OS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty five adult CP-CML patients receiving daily dose of 400 mg IM were subjected to molecular and cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis and at regular time intervals. Median follow up period was 36 months (15-48). Hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses were rated according to ELN. RESULTS: Two Patient groups were distinguished regarding response to IM therapy. A group of 22/55 patients (40%) having pretreatment BCR-ABL(IS) level </=200% and a second patient group 33/55 (60%) having transcript level >200%. The </=10% milestone was achieved by 15/22 patients (68%) versus 7/33 patients (21%), p=0.04 in favor of the first group. Optimal responders in first group were 14/22 (64%) compared to 13/33 (39%) in second group, p=0.02. Achievement of 10% transcript level significantly correlated with longer PFS. The median BCR-ABL(IS) transcripts levels in optimal responders at 3, 6 and 18 months was 10%, 2% and 0.1%, respectively compared to 100%, 65% and 10%, in suboptimal/resistant patients p=0.001. Resistance in 11 patients was correlated with identifiable ABL Kinase mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The Pretreatment 200% cutoff and the 3 month BCR-ABL(IS) </=10% transcript levels proved strong predictors of response to IM and significantly correlated with probability of CCyR, MMR and PFS.","['El-Metnawy, Wafaa H', 'Mattar, Mervat M', 'El-Nahass, Yasser H', 'Samra, Mohamed A', 'Abdelhamid, Hala M', 'Abdlfattah, Raafat M', 'Hamed, Ahmad R']","['El-Metnawy WH', 'Mattar MM', 'El-Nahass YH', 'Samra MA', 'Abdelhamid HM', 'Abdlfattah RM', 'Hamed AR']","['Clinical Oncology Center, School of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Biomed Sci,International journal of biomedical science : IJBS,101231951,,,,PMC3644415,,2013/05/16 06:00,2013/05/16 06:01,['2013/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/16 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Biomed Sci. 2013 Mar;9(1):48-53.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCRABL transcript', 'CPCML', 'cytogenetic', 'molecular responses']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults and its incidence increases with age. Diagnostic cytogenetics is an important prognostic indicator for predicting outcome of AML. We examined the karyotypic patterns of 480 patients with de novo AML seen at government hospitals throughout the country and evaluated the association of chromosome aberrations with the age of patient. Chromosome abnormalities were detected in 146 (30.4%) patients. The most common cytogenetic abnormality was balanced translocation t (8; 21), followed by trisomy 8 (as sole abnormality) and t (15; 17). The age of our Malaysian patients at diagnosis ranged from four months to 81 years, with a median age of 39 years. The normal karyotype was found mainly in patients aged 15-30 years. About 75% of patients with t (8; 21) were below 40 years of age, and the complex karyotype was found with the highest frequently (34.3%) in elderly patients (age above 60 years). More than half of the patients with complex karyotype were above 50 years of age. The deletion 5q was detected only in patients aged above 50 years. Different cytogenetic abnormalities in AML show different frequencies with increasing age. Probably different genetic mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of AML and these mechanisms might occur at different frequencies over lifetime.","['Meng, Chin Yuet', 'Noor, Puteri J', 'Ismail, Azli', 'Ahid, Mohd Fadly Md', 'Zakaria, Zubaidah']","['Meng CY', 'Noor PJ', 'Ismail A', 'Ahid MF', 'Zakaria Z']","['Hematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Biomed Sci,International journal of biomedical science : IJBS,101231951,,,,PMC3644412,,2013/05/16 06:00,2013/05/16 06:01,['2013/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/16 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Biomed Sci. 2013 Mar;9(1):26-32.,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'age', 'chromosome abnormalities']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that treatment of HL-60 cells with 100 microM H2O2 and 1 microM thapsigargin induced a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]c) due to calcium release from internal stores. These stimulatory effects on calcium signals were followed by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), as well as a time-dependent increase in caspase-9 and -3 activities. Our results also show that H2O2 and thapsigargin were able to increase the relative content of fragmented DNA and phosphatidylserine externalization, as detected by double-staining with propidium iodide (PI) and annexin-V-FITC, respectively. Treatment of cells with H2O2 or thapsigargin resulted in activation of the proapoptotic protein Bid. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed active Bax was bound to Bid, which regulates Bid activity and promotes apoptosis. Our findings suggest that H2O2(-) and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis is dependent on rises in [Ca(2+)]c in human myeloid HL-60 cells.","['Bejarano, Ignacio', 'Espino, Javier', 'Gonzalez-Flores, David', 'Casado, Javier G', 'Redondo, Pedro C', 'Rosado, Juan A', 'Barriga, Carmen', 'Pariente, Jose A', 'Rodriguez, Ana B']","['Bejarano I', 'Espino J', 'Gonzalez-Flores D', 'Casado JG', 'Redondo PC', 'Rosado JA', 'Barriga C', 'Pariente JA', 'Rodriguez AB']","['Department of Physiology, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Biomed Sci,International journal of biomedical science : IJBS,101231951,,,,PMC3614781,,2009/09/01 00:00,2009/09/01 00:01,['2013/05/16 06:00'],"['2009/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Biomed Sci. 2009 Sep;5(3):246-56.,,['NOTNLM'],"['H2O2', 'HL-60 cells', 'apoptosis', 'calcium signal', 'caspases', 'mitochondria']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past twenty years, differentiation was found as an important effective measure to treat leukemia with fewer side effects. Gossypol, a natural compound which has been used as an effective contraceptive drug, has been proposed to be a potent drug to treat leukemia, but the differentiation effect has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the pro-differentiated effects, in vitro, of gossypol on the classic human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line. The effects of gossypol were investigated by using morphological changes, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction, surface markers, cell-cycle analysis and Western blot analysis, etc. When HL-60 cells were incubated with low concentrations of gossypol (2-5muM) for 48hr, a prominent G0/G1 arrest was observed. At 96 hr of treatment, 90% of HL-60 cells differentiated, as evidenced by morphological changes, NBT reduction, and increase in cell surface expression of some molecules were detected. This study is the first to identify gossypol's pro-differentiated effects on the leukemia cell line, and it induced differentiation through the PBK (PDZ-binding kinase)/TOPK (T-LAKcell-originated protein kinase) (PBK/TOPK) pathway. It is concluded that gossypol could induce differentiation in the leukemia HL-60 cells, and it may be a potential therapeutic agent, chemoprevention or chemotherapeutic adjuvant especially in combination drug therapy for leukemia.","['Wang, Wen-Qing', 'Li, Rong', 'Bai, Qing-Xian', 'Liu, Yu-Hong', 'Zhang, Wei-Ping', 'Wang, Juan-Hong', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Li, Yuan-Fei', 'Chen, Xie-Qun', 'Huang, Gao-Sheng']","['Wang WQ', 'Li R', 'Bai QX', 'Liu YH', 'Zhang WP', 'Wang JH', 'Wang Z', 'Li YF', 'Chen XQ', 'Huang GS']","[""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Provience, P.

The infections induce a lot of various human diseases and are one of the main causes of human mortality. In particular, they can lead to development of various human cancers. Up to 15-20% of human cancer incidence can be attributed to viruses. Although viral infections are very common in the general population, only few of them result in clinically relevant lesions. Certain associations between virus infections and malignancy are strong and irrefutable, the others are still speculative. The criteria most often used for determining the causality are the consistence of the association, either epidemiologic or at the molecular level, and oncogenicity of viruses or particular viral genes in animal models or cell cultures. Due to some ambiguity of such a determination, it is instructive to consider by specific cases what evidence is generally accepted as sufficient to establish a causal relation between virus and cancer. Lymphomas are one of the best studied cancer types closely associated with a small but definite range of viruses. Numerous data show a close interrelation between lymphomagenesis and infection by such viruses as Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For instance, experiments on monkeys artificially infected with viruses and data on anti-cancer effect of specific antiviral preparations strongly suggest the involvement of viruses in lymphoma development. The present review is devoted to the association of different viruses with human lymphomas and to viral genes potentially involved in the neoplastic process. The recognition of virus involvement in lymphomagenesis may facilitate new strategies for cancer therapy, diagnosis and screening and can lead to a reduction in the number of individuals at risk of disease.","['Tarantul, V Z']",['Tarantul VZ'],"['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Biomed Sci,International journal of biomedical science : IJBS,101231951,,,,PMC3614592,,2006/06/01 00:00,2006/06/01 00:01,['2013/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Biomed Sci. 2006 Jun;2(2):101-13.,,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV', 'HIV virus HIV', 'epstein-barr virus', 'epstein-barrvirus', 'hepatitis b virus', 'hepatitis cvirus', 'herpesvirus', 'lymphoma', 'oncogenicity', 'virus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-diarrheal drugs, antiemetic agents, and/or fluid replacement should be used to treat these patients. The improved hematological toxicity of bosutinib compared with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been ascribed to its minimal activity against platelet-derived growth factor receptor and KIT.

Current Protocols in Cytometry, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2008]. However, low cellularity has been an historical problem with these samples. Several studies indicate that immediate addition of a stabilization media (e.g., RPMI with fetal calf serum (FCS)) to CSF improves the cell yield for FCI [(1) de Graaf et al.]. Such stabilization medias can, however, significantly increase cost. METHODS: We compared FCI results in CSF stabilized with RPMI 1640 (without additional additives) to results obtained using non-stabilized CSF. Samples were processed according to published CLSI guidelines [(2) Szamosi et al.]. RESULTS: About 98/105 (93%) CSF specimens stabilized with RPMI had adequate numbers of viable cells (>100) for performing FCI. About 65/217 (30%) CSF specimens without stabilization had adequate numbers of viable cells for analysis (70% either quantity not sufficient (QNS) or specimen viability below analytical limits). CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing RMPI without FCS as a stabilization media results in increased cell yield and improved FCI results.

Previously it was reported that miR-15/16 is the target of 13q14 deletions and plays a tumor suppressor role by suppressing Bcl-2. Therefore, Bcl-2 expression was examined more closely to determine whether it would predict 13q14 deletion status. METHODS: A multi-color flow panel consisting of anti-Bcl-2/anti-lambda/anti-kappa/CD19/CD5/CD3/CD20 was performed. The ability of Bcl-2 to predict 13q14 deletion was tested using the conventional Bcl-2 index (c-index): mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CLL clone/MFI of residual T cells. Fifty-four untreated CLL/MBL patients were studied. Bimodal Bcl-2 expression was evaluated to test the ability of Bcl-2 to detect intraclonal heterogeneity. Other CLL prognostic markers including CD38, CD49d, CD26, and CD69 were evaluated. FISH was performed on selected sorted populations. RESULTS: The Bcl-2 c-index strongly predicts del13q14 P < 0.0001. A statistically significant association was observed between the percentage of cells carrying the deletion and the level of Bcl-2 expression P < 0.05. Cells sorted based on Bcl-2 expression showed enrichment of both hemizygous and homozygous del 13q14 cells. Also, we observed that an alteration in Bcl-2 level over time predicts changes in 13q14 deletion status. And a statistically significant correlation between the bimodal pattern of CD69 expression and the presence of 13q14 deletion was found P < 0.0001.

Most clinical trials evaluating the strategy of inhibiting efflux-mediated chemotherapeutic resistance have been unsuccessful, clearly indicating the need for a better approach. METHODS: This study investigated the clinical relevance of 380 genes whose expression has been shown to affect the response to chemotherapy, mostly through in vitro studies, in 11 paired samples obtained at AML diagnosis and at relapse. The expression profiling of these 380 genes was performed using TaqMan-based quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Patients had a median age of 58 years at diagnosis, a median duration of complete remission of 284.5 days, and a median overall survival of 563 days. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected at diagnosis in 4 patients, whereas 5 displayed a normal karyotype and 2 were not investigated. RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering shows that samples taken at diagnosis and relapse clustered in pairs for 6 patients of the 11 studied, suggesting recurrence of the same leukemic blast, whereas for the other 5 patients, the data indicate their relapse blasts arose from different origins. A patient-by-patient analysis of the paired samples led to the striking observation that each had a unique gene signature representing different mechanisms of resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The data underline the need for personalized molecular analysis to tailor treatment for patients with AML.","['Patel, Chirayu', 'Stenke, Leif', 'Varma, Sudhir', 'Lindberg, Marita Lagergren', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Sjoberg, Jan', 'Viktorsson, Kristina', 'Lewensohn, Rolf', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Gottesman, Michael M', 'Gillet, Jean-Pierre']","['Patel C', 'Stenke L', 'Varma S', 'Lindberg ML', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Sjoberg J', 'Viktorsson K', 'Lewensohn R', 'Landgren O', 'Gottesman MM', 'Gillet JP']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['ZIA BC005598-23/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130514,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Glutathione Reductase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",PMC3735855,['NIHMS457096'],2013/05/16 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28098 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Aug 15;119(16):3076-83. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28098.

To investigate the role of AML1-ETO in leukemogenesis, we transfected the cloned AML1-ETO cDNA and expressed the AML1-ETO protein in U937 myelomonocytic leukemia cells. By focusing on the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, the key regulator gene of granulocytic differentiation CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) and the tumor suppressor gene p14(ARF), we found that both AML1-ETO-expressing cell lines and t(8;21) leukemia samples displayed low levels of these three genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Bcl-2, CEBPA and p14(ARF) were direct transcriptional targets of AML1-ETO. The universal binding of AML1-ETO to genomic DNA resulted in recruitment of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), reduction of histone H3 or H4 acetylation and increased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 as well as lysine 27 indicating that AML1-ETO induced heterochromatic silencing of Bcl-2, CEBPA and p14(ARF). These results suggested that the aberrant transcription factor AML1-ETO epigenetically silenced the function of the Bcl-2, CEBPA and p14(ARF) genes by inducing repressed chromatin configurations at their promoters through histone modifications.","['Zhuang, Wen-Yue', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Chen, Zi-Xing']","['Zhuang WY', 'Cen JN', 'Zhao Y', 'Chen ZX']","['The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou, Jiangsu, P.R.

In Western countries, the population is aging, which means there will be an increasing number of older patients. However, in the past few decades, there has been little improvement in treating them, and few clinical trials specifically designed for older patients with ALL have been reported. Older patients with ALL have a significantly lower complete response rate, higher early mortality, higher relapse rate, and poorer survival compared with younger patients. This is partly explained by a higher incidence of poor prognostic factors. Most importantly, intensive chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation, both of which are successful in younger patients, is less well tolerated in older patients. For the future, the most promising approaches are optimized supportive care, targeted therapies, moderately intensified consolidation, and reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation. One of the most important challenges for physicians is to differentiate between fit and unfit older patients in order to offer both groups optimal treatment regarding toxicity and mortality risks, quality of life, and long-term outcome.

Previous studies of T-ALL mouse models induced by different genetic mutations have provided highly diverse results on the issues of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma-initiating cells (T-LICs) and potential mechanisms contributing to T-LIC transformation. Here, we show that oncogenic Kras (Kras G12D) expressed from its endogenous locus is a potent inducer of T-ALL even in a less sensitized BALB/c background. Notch1 mutations, including exon 34 mutations and recently characterized type 1 and 2 deletions, are detected in 100% of Kras G12D-induced T-ALL tumors. Although these mutations are not detected at the pre-leukemia stage, incremental up-regulation of NOTCH1 surface expression is observed at the pre-leukemia and leukemia stages. As secondary genetic hits in the Kras G12D model, Notch1 mutations target CD8(+) T-cells but not hematopoietic stem cells to further promote T-ALL progression. Pre-leukemia T-cells without detectable Notch1 mutations do not induce T-ALL in secondary recipient mice compared with T-ALL tumor cells with Notch1 mutations. We found huge variations in T-LIC frequency and immunophenotypes of cells enriched for T-LICs. Unlike Pten deficiency-induced T-ALL, oncogenic Kras-initiated T-ALL is not associated with up-regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Our results suggest that up-regulation of NOTCH1 signaling, through either overexpression of surface NOTCH1 or acquired gain-of-function mutations, is involved in both T-ALL initiation and progression. Notch1 mutations and Kras G12D contribute cooperatively to leukemogenic transformation of normal T-cells.","['Kong, Guangyao', 'Du, Juan', 'Liu, Yangang', 'Meline, Benjamin', 'Chang, Yuan-I', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Wang, Jinyong', 'Zhang, Jing']","['Kong G', 'Du J', 'Liu Y', 'Meline B', 'Chang YI', 'Ranheim EA', 'Wang J', 'Zhang J']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130514,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/surgery', 'Preleukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",PMC3689964,,2013/05/16 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2013/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45811-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.475376 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Jun 21;288(25):18219-27. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.475376.

Previous work has shown that FLASH localizes to Cajal bodies and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. However, the function of its nuclear body association remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that murine FLASH is covalently modified by SUMO at Lys residue 1792. Interestingly, ectopic expression of SUMO results in proteasome-dependent degradation of FLASH. A point mutant of FLASH with a mutated SUMO acceptor lysine residue, FLASH(K1792R), is resistant to SUMO-induced degradation. Finally, we show that arsenic trioxide, a drug known to potentiate SUMO modification and degradation of PML, triggers recruitment of FLASH to PML bodies and concomitant loss of FLASH protein. Our data suggest that SUMO targets FLASH for proteasome-dependent degradation, which is associated with recruitment of FLASH to PML bodies.","['Vennemann, Astrid', 'Hofmann, Thomas G']","['Vennemann A', 'Hofmann TG']","['German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Research Group Cellular Senescence, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130513,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CASP8AP2 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Casp8ap2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3735705,,2013/05/16 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['24943 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.24943 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Jun 15;12(12):1914-21. doi: 10.4161/cc.24943.

Around 3% of adult B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients show this aberration. Flow cytometry mostly reveals a ""mature B-ALL"" or ""Burkitt-type"" ALL immunophenotype. Using long-distance PCR for t(8;14)/MYC-IGH fusion, we investigated bone marrow, peripheral blood and a few other samples with suspected Burkitt-ALL or mature B-ALL and identified 133 MYC-IGH-positive cases. The location of the chromosomal breaks in the IGH joining and the 8 different switch regions was determined using a set of long-distance PCRs. The chromosomal breakpoints with the adjacent MYC regions on 8q24 were characterized by direct sequencing in 49 cases. The distribution of chromosomal breaks among the IGH joining and switch regions was the following: JH 23.3%, M 21.8%, G1 15.0%, G2 7.5%, G3 3.8%, G4 4.5%, A1 12.8%, A2 3.8%, E 7.5%. Two breakpoint clusters near MYC were delineated. There was no clear correlation between the degree of somatic hypermutation and the chromosomal break locations. Epstein Barr virus was detected in 5 cases (4%). This detailed and extensive molecular analysis illustrates the molecular complexity of the MYC-IGH translocations and the detected distribution of breakpoints provides additional evidence that this translocation results from failed switch and VDJ recombinations. This study may serve as a model for the analysis of other IGH translocations in B-cell lymphoma.","['Burmeister, Thomas', 'Molkentin, Mara', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Reinhardt, Richard']","['Burmeister T', 'Molkentin M', 'Schwartz S', 'Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E', 'Reinhardt R']","['Charite, Med.

However, some trials are better-reported than others. Non-publication or delayed publication could lead to bias in a review. We identify trial characteristics affecting how quickly or widely results of randomized trials are reported, and hence how likely the trial is to be found by reviewers. METHODS: We analyzed all randomized trials in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia that began before 1988 and all articles for these trials published before 2000, as identified by the Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) Collaborative Group secretariat. This was the set of 149 trials included in the Second International Collaborative Workshop on Childhood ALL Studies at the end of 1992, comprising 243 randomized comparisons. We used multiple linear regression to analyze time to first mention or to first reporting of results (time to publication), logistic regression for whether a randomization was ever mentioned or reported, and Poisson regression for frequency of mentions or publications. RESULTS: Collectively, the articles mentioned 217 randomizations, with results reported for 188. Highly statistically significant results were published faster, each tenfold reduction in the p-value (e.g., going from 0.5 to 0.05 or from 0.05 to 0.005) resulting in publication on average 20 months earlier (95% confidence interval 6-34, p = 0.005), non-statistically significant results from trials outside North America and Europe took on average 55 months longer than those without these characteristics (95% CI 22-88, p = 0.001), and results from trials in high income countries were more likely to reach publication at some point than were results from other countries (odds ratio 7.8, 95% CI 2.4-25.3, p = 0.0006). Randomizations in high income countries were mentioned 73 months earlier than those in middle or low income countries (95% CI 51-94, p < 0.0001), were more likely to ever be mentioned (OR 13.1, 95% CI 2.1-80.9, p = 0.006), and were mentioned more frequently (incidence ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5, p = 0.003), as were North American trials compared with those conducted elsewhere (IR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviewers should not rely solely on published reports, but should use additional ways of finding trials in order to minimize biases related to results and other trial characteristics. This relates both to published reports of trial results and to mentions of trials in the literature.","['Burrett, Julie A', 'Lunn, Daniel']","['Burrett JA', 'Lunn D']","['Clinical Trial Service Unit & Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU), University of Oxford Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Oxford, UK Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. julie.burrett@ctsu.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Evid Based Med,Journal of evidence-based medicine,101497477,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Publishing/*standards', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods/*standards', 'Time Factors']",,,2011/11/01 00:00,2013/11/01 06:00,['2013/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1756-5391.2011.01157.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Evid Based Med. 2011 Nov;4(4):217-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1756-5391.2011.01157.x.,"['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd and Chinese Cochrane Center, West', 'China Hospital of Sichuan University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we present evidence that decitabine (DAC), a DNA methylation inhibitor that is currently used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other malignant neoplasms, is capable of eliciting an anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in mouse EL4 tumor model. C57BL/6 mice with established EL4 tumors were treated with DAC (1.0 mg/kg body weight) once daily for 5 days. We found that DAC treatment resulted in infiltration of IFN-gamma producing T lymphocytes into tumors and caused tumor rejection. Depletion of CD8(+), but not CD4(+) T cells resumed tumor growth. DAC-induced CTL response appeared to be elicited by the induction of CD80 expression on tumor cells. Epigenetic evidence suggests that DAC induces CD80 expression in EL4 cells via demethylation of CpG dinucleotide sites in the promoter of CD80 gene. In addition, we also showed that a transient, low-dose DAC treatment can induce CD80 gene expression in a variety of human cancer cells. This study provides the first evidence that epigenetic modulation can induce the expression of a major T cell co-stimulatory molecule on cancer cells, which can overcome immune tolerance, and induce an efficient anti-tumor CTL response. The results have important implications in designing DAC-based cancer immunotherapy.","['Wang, Li-Xin', 'Mei, Zhen-Yang', 'Zhou, Ji-Hao', 'Yao, Yu-Shi', 'Li, Yong-Hui', 'Xu, Yi-Han', 'Li, Jing-Xin', 'Gao, Xiao-Ning', 'Zhou, Min-Hang', 'Jiang, Meng-Meng', 'Gao, Li', 'Ding, Yi', 'Lu, Xue-Chun', 'Shi, Jin-Long', 'Luo, Xu-Feng', 'Wang, Jia', 'Wang, Li-Li', 'Qu, Chunfeng', 'Bai, Xue-Feng', 'Yu, Li']","['Wang LX', 'Mei ZY', 'Zhou JH', 'Yao YS', 'Li YH', 'Xu YH', 'Li JX', 'Gao XN', 'Zhou MH', 'Jiang MM', 'Gao L', 'Ding Y', 'Lu XC', 'Shi JL', 'Luo XF', 'Wang J', 'Wang LL', 'Qu C', 'Bai XF', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['R01 CA138427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3650049,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/12/25 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0062924 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-38521 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 9;8(5):e62924. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062924.

Homogeneous FGSC cultures were established by G418 selection and continued to express ziwi for more than 6 weeks along with the germ cell markers nanos3, dnd, dazl and vasa. A key component of the cell culture system was the use of a feeder cell line that was initiated from ovaries of a transgenic line of fish [Tg(gsdf:neo)] that expresses Neo controlled by the zebrafish gonadal soma derived factor (gsdf) promoter. The feeder cell line was selected in G418 and engineered to express zebrafish leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), basic fibroblast growth factor (Fgf2) and glial-cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf). These factors were shown to significantly enhance FGSC growth, survival and germline competency in culture. Results from cell transplantation experiments revealed that the cultured FGSCs were able to successfully colonize the gonad of sterile recipient fish and generate functional gametes. Up to 20% of surviving recipient fish that were injected with the cultured FGSCs were fertile and generated multiple batches of normal offspring for at least 6 months. The FGSC cultures will provide an in vitro system for studies of zebrafish germ cell growth and differentiation and their high frequency of germline transmission following transplantation could form the basis of a stem cell-mediated strategy for gene transfer and manipulation of the zebrafish genome.","['Wong, Ten-Tsao', 'Tesfamichael, Abraham', 'Collodi, Paul']","['Wong TT', 'Tesfamichael A', 'Collodi P']","['Department of Animal Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.

Precursor-B ALL comprises 80% of cases, and the CD19 antigen is expressed in nearly all precursor-B ALL patients. Bispecific T-cell-engaging antibodies are novel bioengineered proteins. The bispecific T-cell-engaging antibody blinatumomab engages polyclonal T cells to CD19-expressing B cells. By binding to both CD3 and CD19, blinatumomab physically brings these T cells in close proximity to malignant B cells and potentiates T-cell-induced cytotoxic cell kill. Blinatumomab requires continuous intravenous infusion due to its short half-life, the need for continuous exposure for the drug to exert sufficient efficacy, and lessened toxicity. A phase II trial of B-cell ALL patients with persistent or relapsed minimal residual disease demonstrated an 80% rate of complete molecular remission. Cytokine-release syndrome and central nervous system events, such as seizures and encephalopathy, are reversible toxicities.

Here, we show that murine leukemia virus (MLV) has a unique means of counteracting APOBEC3 and other cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acid. Using virus isolated from infected WT and APOBEC3 KO mice, we demonstrate that the MLV glycosylated Gag protein (glyco-Gag) enhances viral core stability. Moreover, in vitro endogenous reverse transcription reactions of the glyco-Gag mutant virus were substantially inhibited compared with WT virus, but only in the presence of APOBEC3. Thus, glyco-Gag rendered the reverse transcription complex in the viral core resistant to APOBEC3. Glyco-Gag in the virion also rendered MLV resistant to other cytosolic sensors of viral reverse transcription products in newly infected cells. Strikingly, glyco-Gag mutant virus reverted to glyco-Gag-containing virus only in WT and not APOBEC3 KO mice, indicating that counteracting APOBEC3 is the major function of glyco-Gag. Thus, in contrast to the HIV viral infectivity factor protein, which prevents APOBEC3 packaging in the virion, the MLV glyco-Gag protein uses a unique mechanism to counteract the antiviral action of APOBEC3 in vivo--namely, protecting the reverse transcription complex in viral cores from APOBEC3. These data suggest that capsid integrity may play a critical role in virus resistance to intrinsic cellular antiviral resistance factors that act at the early stages of infection.","['Stavrou, Spyridon', 'Nitta, Takayuki', 'Kotla, Swathi', 'Ha, Dat', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Rein, Alan R', 'Fan, Hung', 'Ross, Susan R']","['Stavrou S', 'Nitta T', 'Kotla S', 'Ha D', 'Nagashima K', 'Rein AR', 'Fan H', 'Ross SR']","['Department of Microbiology, Abramson Cancer Center and Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19103, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA094188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA115299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-94188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA115299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI07324/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI085015/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007324/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-AI100512/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN26120080001E/PHS HHS/United States', 'F32 AI100512/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI-085015/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130513,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glycosylation', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcription/*physiology']",PMC3670389,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1217399110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1217399110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 May 28;110(22):9078-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1217399110.

Hitherto, however, it has proved difficult to generate truly functional HSCs transplantable to adult host mice. Here, we demonstrate a unique in vivo differentiation system yielding engraftable HSCs from mouse and human iPSCs in teratoma-bearing animals in combination with a maneuver to facilitate hematopoiesis. In mice, we found that iPSC-derived HSCs migrate from teratomas into the BM and their intravenous injection into irradiated recipients resulted in multilineage and long-term reconstitution of the hematolymphopoietic system in serial transfers. Using this in vivo generation system, we could demonstrate that X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) mice can be treated by HSCs derived from gene-corrected clonal iPSCs. It should also be noted that neither leukemia nor tumors were observed in recipients after transplantation of iPSC-derived HSCs. Taken our findings together, our system presented in this report should provide a useful tool not only for the study of HSCs, but also for practical application of iPSCs in the treatment of hematologic and immunologic diseases.","['Suzuki, Nao', 'Yamazaki, Satoshi', 'Yamaguchi, Tomoyuki', 'Okabe, Motohito', 'Masaki, Hideki', 'Takaki, Satoshi', 'Otsu, Makoto', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu']","['Suzuki N', 'Yamazaki S', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Okabe M', 'Masaki H', 'Takaki S', 'Otsu M', 'Nakauchi H']","['Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130514,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Teratoma/*pathology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology']",PMC3705943,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)31966-9 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2013.71 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2013 Jul;21(7):1424-31. doi: 10.1038/mt.2013.71.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Children 0 to 21 years old presenting to a tertiary pediatric hospital with a diagnosis of a malignant tumor involving the mandible were included. Comparison groups included children from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database with malignant mandible tumors as well as a group of children with benign mandibular lesions from the same institution. Main outcome measures for the institutional malignant group included presentation, tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with malignant and 183 patients with benign lesions were identified at the primary institution. The most common presentation in both groups was mandibular swelling or mass. Malignant tumors included sarcoma (n = 11), leukemia/lymphoma (n = 2), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1), malignant spindle cell tumor (n = 1), and yolk sac tumor (n = 1). The national database identified 56 malignant cases, of which 71% were sarcomas. Thirteen patients at our institution (81%) underwent mandibulectomy and 12 were reconstructed using free tissue transfer. Eleven of the 13 (85%) were treated with adjuvant therapy. After an average follow-up of 32.8 months, seven (44%) had no evidence of disease, three (19%) were deceased, three (19%) were alive with disease, and three (19%) were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant mandibular tumors in children are most often sarcomas but can include other rare lesions. Free flap reconstruction is a reasonable option for even very young children requiring extensive mandibular surgery.","['Benoit, Margo McKenna', 'Vargas, Sara O', 'Bhattacharyya, Neil', 'McGill, Trevor A', 'Robson, Caroline D', 'Ferraro, Nalton', 'Didas, Amanda E', 'Labow, Brian I', 'Upton, Joseph', 'Taghinia, Amir', 'Meara, John G', 'Marcus, Karen J', 'Mack, Jennifer', 'Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos', 'Rahbar, Reza']","['Benoit MM', 'Vargas SO', 'Bhattacharyya N', 'McGill TA', 'Robson CD', 'Ferraro N', 'Didas AE', 'Labow BI', 'Upton J', 'Taghinia A', 'Meara JG', 'Marcus KJ', 'Mack J', 'Rodriguez-Galindo C', 'Rahbar R']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Strong Memorial Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York 14642, USA. margo_benoit@urmc.rochester.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130513,United States,Laryngoscope,The Laryngoscope,8607378,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mandible/*pathology/surgery', 'Mandibular Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/*methods', 'Sarcoma/*pathology/surgery', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/lary.24020 [doi]'],ppublish,Laryngoscope. 2013 Aug;123(8):2035-42. doi: 10.1002/lary.24020.

We prospectively analyzed the impact of cytogenetic abnormalities on outcomes during the phase 2 PX-171-003-A1 study of single-agent carfilzomib for relapsed and refractory MM. In the response-evaluable population (257/266), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)/conventional cytogenetic profiles were available for 229 patients; 62 (27.1%) had high-risk cytogenetics--del 17p13, t(4;14) or t(14;16) by interphase FISH or deletion 13 or hypodiploidy by metaphase cytogenetics--and 167 (72.9%) had standard-risk profiles. Generally, baseline characteristics were similar between the subgroups, but International Staging System stage III disease was more common in high- vs standard-risk patients (41.9% vs 27.5%) as was Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1/2 (85.5% vs 68.3%). Overall response was comparable between the subgroups (25.8% vs 24.6%, respectively; P=0.85), while time-to-event end points showed a trend of shorter duration in high-risk patients, including median duration of response (5.6 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.7-7.8) vs 8.3 months (95% CI 5.6-12.3)) and overall survival (9.3 (95% CI 6.5-13.0) vs 19.0 months (95% CI 15.4-NE); P=0.0003).

Altered expression of the anti-apoptoticBcl-xL has been correlated with BCR-ABL leukemogenesis; however, its involvement in the pathogenesis and evolution of CML has not been formally demonstrated yet. Thus, we generated an inducible mouse model in which simultaneous expression of p210-BCR-ABL1 and deletion of bcl-x occurs within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Absence of Bcl-xL did not affect development of the chronic phase-like myeloproliferative disease, but none of the deficient mice progressed to an advanced phenotype, suggesting the importance of Bcl-xL in survival of progressing early progenitor cells. Indeed, pharmacological antagonism of Bcl-xL, with ABT-263, combined with PP242-induced activation of BAD markedly augmented apoptosis of CML-BC cell lines and primary CD34(+) progenitors but not those from healthy donors, regardless of drug resistance induced by bone marrow stromal cell-generated signals. Moreover, studies in which BAD or Bcl-xL expression was molecularly altered strongly support their involvement in ABT-263/PP242-induced apoptosis of CML-BC progenitors. Thus, suppression of the antiapoptotic potential of Bcl-xL together with BAD activation represents an effective pharmacological approach for patients undergoing blastic transformation.","['Harb, J G', 'Neviani, P', 'Chyla, B J', 'Ellis, J J', 'Ferenchak, G J', 'Oaks, J J', 'Walker, C J', 'Hokland, P', 'Roy, D C', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Marcucci, G', 'Huettner, C S', 'Perrotti, D']","['Harb JG', 'Neviani P', 'Chyla BJ', 'Ellis JJ', 'Ferenchak GJ', 'Oaks JJ', 'Walker CJ', 'Hokland P', 'Roy DC', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Marcucci G', 'Huettner CS', 'Perrotti D']","['1] Human Cancer Genetics Program, Department Molecular Virology Immunology and Medical Genetics, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Blood Center of Wisconsin, Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA163800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA163800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007209/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130514,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'H5669VNZ7V (PP242)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3833002,['NIHMS527273'],2013/05/15 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013151 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.151 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):1996-2005. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.151.

Extracts prepared from Trametes versicolor under the trade name of I'm-Yunity exhibit anti-tumorigenic activities, as supported by inhibition of the proliferation and induction of apoptosis in malignant cells. Similar effects have also been observed for the Reishi mushroom Ganoderma lucidum. The two mushrooms exert their medicinal activities primarily through a family of polysaccharo-peptides. Despite the common identity in their bioactive ingredients, whether their combination might elicit an expanded efficacy and mechanism has not been investigated. In the present study, we investigated similarities and differences between extracts prepared from I'm-Yunity and from a formulation denoted I'm-Yunity-Too combining I'm-Yunity and Ganoderma lucidum. By assaying their anti-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects using human promyelocytic HL-60 cells, we found that the ethanolic extract of I'm-Yunity-Too was more active in inducing cell death compared to I'm-Yunity, based on measured changes in the expression of caspase 3 and Bax. Moreover, ethanolic extracts of I'm-Yunity-Too exhibited more potent activity compared to its aqueous extracts with regard to suppression of the growth and induction of apoptosis, as assayed by the more pronounced downregulation of phosphorylation of Rb and increased cleavage of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) from its native 112-kDa form to the inactive 89-kDa product. These results suggested that the chemopreventive potential of I'm-Yunity may be enhanced by adding Ganoderma lucidum and that their bioactive ingre-dients potentially exhibit mechanistic synergism suggesting a more efficacious adjunct in chemotherapy.","['Hsieh, Tze-Chen', 'Wu, Joseph M']","['Hsieh TC', 'Wu JM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130510,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', ""0 (I'm-Yunity)"", '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Agaricales/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Reishi/*chemistry']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2013.1378 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2013 Jul;32(1):251-7. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2013.1378.

However, relapse/refractory patients showing resistance to ATRA and/or As2O3 are recognized as a clinically significant problem. Genetic mutations resulting in amino acid substitution in the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) ligand binding domain (LBD) and the PML-B2 domain of PML-RARalpha, respectively, have been reported as molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to ATRA and As2O3. In the LBD mutation, ATRA binding with LBD is generally impaired, and ligand-dependent co-repressor dissociation and degradation of PML-RARalpha by the proteasome pathway, leading to cell differentiation, are inhibited. The PML-B2 mutation interferes with the direct binding of As2O3 with PML-B2, and PML-RARalpha SUMOylation with As2O3 followed by multimerization and degradation is impaired. To overcome ATRA resistance, utilization of As2O3 provides a preferable outcome, and recently, a synthetic retinoid Am80, which has a higher binding affinity with PML-RARalpha than ATRA, has been tested in the clinical setting. However, no strategy attempted to date has been successful in overcoming As2O3 resistance. Detailed genomic analyses using patient samples harvested repeatedly may help in predicting the prognosis, selecting the effective targeting drugs, and designing new sophisticated strategies for the treatment of APL.","['Tomita, Akihiro', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Tomita A', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Japan. atomita@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130514,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1354-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Jun;97(6):717-25. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1354-4.

There was no cross-reaction with other animal viruses (e.g., goat pox virus, bovine leukemia virus, bovine mucosal disease virus, swine influenza virus and Nipah virus). When applied in parallel with serological AGID and conventional PCR for detection of CAEV in field samples, this assay exhibited a higher sensitivity than these traditional methods, and 7.8 % of the 308 specimens collected in the Shanxi and Tianjin regions of China from 1993 to 2011 were found to be positive. Thus, the TaqMan qPCR assay provides a fast, specific and sensitive means for detecting CAEV proviral DNA in goat specimens and should be useful for large-scale detection in eradication programs and epidemiological studies.","['Li, Yi', 'Zhou, Fengjuan', 'Li, Xia', 'Wang, Jianhua', 'Zhao, Xiangping', 'Huang, Jinhai']","['Li Y', 'Zhou F', 'Li X', 'Wang J', 'Zhao X', 'Huang J']","['School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.

CGR8 cells express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as demonstrated by measurement of enzyme activity and substantial inhibition by bromoacetylcholine. Pluripotent CGR8 cells showed a ChAT activity of 250 pmol acetylcholine/mg/h, contained 1.1 pmol acetylcholine/10(6) cells and released about 12.00 pmol acetylcholine/1 x 10(6) cells/6 h. Removal of LIF induced early differentiation as evidenced by reduced transcription factors Oct-4 and Nanog and a substantial slowing of the proliferation rate. Under this condition acetylcholine synthesis increased to 1640 pmol/mg/h; related to the pluripotent state the content of acetylcholine increased 10-fold and the release to about 32 pmol acetylcholine/1 x 10(6) cells/6 h. Enzyme kinetic analysis showed a significant increase of the K(m) for the precursor acetyl-CoA and of V(max) without a change of the K(m) for the precursor choline.

Chromatin remodeling through histone acetylation is one of the major mechanisms of transcriptional control of genes, and is involved in 'gene silencing' of antioncogenes in various tumour cells. Chromatin remodeling is also involved in transcriptional control of other genes, such as NKG2D ligand genes. Histone deacetylases and acetyltransferases are involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and increased/decreased activity of histone deacetylases has been reported in several cancer types. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were reportedly active in many cancers including hematological malignancies, and have been shown in numerous experiments to reduce cancer cell growth and enhance cell differentiation, growth arrest and apoptosis. In acute myeloid leukaemia, histone deacetylase inhibitors alone had limited efficacy, but their combination with other anticancer agents yielded promising results. Interleukin (IL)-15 is regarded with great hope in the immunotherapy of cancer, and IL-15-activated cytokine-induced killer cells showed potent antileukemic activity both in vitro and in vivo. IL-15 increases expression of NKG2D and its ligands and can increase natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity against tumour cells. The administration of IL-15 was recently shown to be safe in preclinical models, and there are ongoing clinical trials of IL-15 in patients with cancer and HIV infection. We hypothesise that IL-15 will synergise with histone deacetylase inhibitors in increasing the levels of activatory NKG2D receptors on natural killer and CD8(+) T cells and of their ligands, the MHC class I related molecule A and B, on tumor cells, and will enhance innate immune antitumour responses in acute myeloid leukaemia and other haematological malignancies. Up-regulation of NKG2D-NKG2D-ligand antitumour immune response by combining histone deacetylase inhibitors with IL-15 has the potential to improve the efficacy of acute myeloid leukaemia treatment.","['Zdrenghea, Mihnea T']",['Zdrenghea MT'],"['Oncology Institute, University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca 73, 21 December Blvd, 400124 Cluj-Napoca, Romania. mzdrenghea@umfcluj.ro']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130510,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-15)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*therapeutic use', 'Models, Theoretical']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(13)00191-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2013 Aug;81(2):311-5. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.021.

Herein, we have developed a polymer-protein core-shell nanomedicine to inhibit critically aberrant pro-survival kinases (mTOR, MAPK and STAT5) in primitive (CD34(+)/CD38(-)) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cells. The nanomedicine consists of poly-lactide-co-glycolide core (~250 nm) loaded with mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, and albumin shell (~25 nm thick) loaded with MAPK/STAT5 inhibitor, sorafenib and the whole construct was surface conjugated with monoclonal antibody against CD33 receptor overexpressed in AML. Electron microscopy confirmed formation of core-shell nanostructure (~290 nm) and flow cytometry and confocal studies showed enhanced cellular uptake of targeted nanomedicine. Simultaneous inhibition of critical kinases causing synergistic lethality against leukemic cells, without affecting healthy blood cells, was demonstrated using immunoblotting, cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays. This cell receptor plus multi-kinase targeted core-shell nanomedicine was found better specific and tolerable compared to current clinical regime of cytarabine and daunorubicin. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: These authors demonstrate simultaneous inhibition of critical kinases causing synergistic lethality against leukemic cells, without affecting healthy blood cells by using rationally designed polymer-protein core-shell nanomedicine, provoding an advanced method to eliminate cancer cells, with the hope of future therapeutic use.","['Chandran, Parwathy', 'Gupta, Neha', 'Retnakumari, Archana Payickattu', 'Malarvizhi, Giridharan Loghanathan', 'Keechilat, Pavithran', 'Nair, Shantikumar', 'Koyakutty, Manzoor']","['Chandran P', 'Gupta N', 'Retnakumari AP', 'Malarvizhi GL', 'Keechilat P', 'Nair S', 'Koyakutty M']","['Amrita Centre for Nanosciences and Molecular Medicine, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Kochi, Kerala, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130510,United States,Nanomedicine,"Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",101233142,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '34346-01-5 (Polyglactin 910)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Everolimus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nanomedicine', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Polyglactin 910/chemistry', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/immunology', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/06/18 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1549-9634(13)00185-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nano.2013.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Nanomedicine. 2013 Nov;9(8):1317-27. doi: 10.1016/j.nano.2013.04.012.

The mechanism whereby BCOR functions during eye development to prevent colobomata is not known, but in other contexts it serves as a transcriptional corepressor that potentiates transcriptional repression by B cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL6). Here, we have explored the function of the zebrafish ortholog of Bcl6, Bcl6a, during eye development, and our results demonstrate that Bcl6a, like Bcor, is required to prevent colobomata during optic cup formation. Our data demonstrate that Bcl6a acts downstream of Vax1 and Vax2, known regulators of ventral optic cup formation and choroid fissure closure, and that bcl6a is a direct target of Vax2. Together, this regulatory network functions to repress p53 expression and thereby suppress apoptosis in the developing optic cup. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that Bcl6a functions cooperatively with Bcor, Rnf2 and Hdac1 in a common gene regulatory network that acts to repress p53 and prevent colobomata. Together, these data support a model in which p53-dependent apoptosis needs to be tightly regulated for normal optic cup formation and that Bcl6a, Bcor, Rnf2 and Hdac1 activities mediate this regulation.","['Lee, Jiwoon', 'Lee, Bum-Kyu', 'Gross, Jeffrey M']","['Lee J', 'Lee BK', 'Gross JM']","['Section of Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 EY018005/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P40 RR012546/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY18005/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130512,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (bcl6aa protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tp53 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (vax1 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (vax2 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Coloboma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Eye/*embryology/metabolism', 'Eye Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neuropeptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenopus laevis/embryology/genetics', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3736873,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/02/20 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ddt211 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddt211 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2013 Sep 1;22(17):3568-82. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddt211.

However, the role of NPM in drug-resistance of leukemia has not yet been explored. We designed and selected one shRNA targeting on NPM gene transduction into HL-60 and HL-60/ADR cell lines (an adriamycin resistant cell line) by lentivirus. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation were assessed. The expressions of the related genes and proteins were detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The results showed obvious down-regulation of NPM mRNA and protein levels after NPM RNAi. NPM-targeted RNAi also resulted in many cellular changes, such as, suppressing cell proliferation and inducing cell differentiation. Down-regulation of NPM gene could arrest the cell cycle progression, an increase in the proportion of G0/G1 phase in knockdown groups. NPM gene silencing could also induce pro-apoptotic genes and proteins expression, and inhibit anti-apoptotic genes/proteins expression. Furthermore, IC50 of two chemotherapeutic agents (adriamycin and ADR; daunorubicin and DNR) to HL-60 and HL-60/ADR cells decreased, especially more remarkable on HL-60/ADR cells.

HTLV-1-infected individuals present a spontaneous T lymphocyte proliferation. This phenomenon is related to the HTLV-1-proviral load and the persistence of the infection. Viral proteins induce many cellular mediators, which can be associated with the abnormal cellular proliferation. The intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH) are important to modulate the cellular proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the modulation of intracellular GSH levels and the spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation during the HTLV-1 infection. Intracellular GSH level can be modulated by using dl-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO, GSH synthesis inhibitor) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, peptide precursor). Our results demonstrated that BSO was capable of inducing a decrease in the spontaneous proliferation of PBMC derived from HTLV-1 carriers. On the other hand, the GSH precursor induces an increase in mitogen-stimulated cellular proliferation in infected and uninfected individuals. Similar results were observed by the inhibition of ABCC1/MRP1 protein, augmenting the mitogen-induced proliferation. This effect can be related with an increase in the GSH levels since ABCC1/MRP1 transports GSH to the extracellular medium. There was a significant difference on the expression of CD69 and CD25 molecules during the lymphocyte activation. We did not observe any alterations on CD25 expression induced by BSO or NAC. However, our results demonstrated that NAC treatment induced an increase in CD69 expression on unstimulated CD8(+) T lymphocytes obtained from HTLV-1 infected individuals, healthy donors and HTLV carriers. Therefore, our results suggest that the cellular proliferation promoted by the infection with HTLV-1 and the activation phenotype of CD8(+) T lymphocytes can be regulated by changing the intracellular GSH levels; suggesting the modulation of these intracellular levels as a new approach for the treatment of pathologies associated with the HTLV-1 infection.","['Novaes, Renata', 'Freire-de-Lima, Celio G', 'de Albuquerque, Raquel Cavalcanti', 'Affonso-Mitidieri, Ottilia R', 'Espindola, Otavio', 'Lima, Marco Antonio', 'de Andrada Serpa, Maria Jose', 'Echevarria-Lima, Juliana']","['Novaes R', 'Freire-de-Lima CG', 'de Albuquerque RC', 'Affonso-Mitidieri OR', 'Espindola O', 'Lima MA', 'de Andrada Serpa MJ', 'Echevarria-Lima J']","['Lab. de Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Depto. de Imunologia, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130412,Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '131202-22-7 (buthionine sulfoximine ethyl ester)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Carrier State/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/02/20 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-2985(13)00068-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2013.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2013 Sep;218(9):1166-74. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2013.04.002.

Over 70% of new cases and deaths occur in developing countries. In the early years of the molecular biology revolution, cancer research mainly focuses on genetic alterations, including gastric cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for normal development and maintenance of tissue-specific gene expression patterns in mammals. Disruption of epigenetic processes can lead to altered gene function and malignant cellular transformation. Recent advancements in the rapidly evolving field of cancer epigenetics have shown extensive reprogramming of every component of the epigenetic machinery in cancer, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs. Aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter regions of gene, which leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes in cancer cells, is the most well-defined epigenetic hallmark in gastric cancer. The advantages of gene methylation as a target for detection and diagnosis of cancer in biopsy specimens and non-invasive body fluids such as serum and gastric washes have led to many studies of application in gastric cancer. This review focuses on the most common and important phenomenon of epigenetics, DNA methylation, in gastric cancer and illustrates the impact epigenetics has had on this field.","['Qu, Yiping', 'Dang, Siwen', 'Hou, Peng']","['Qu Y', 'Dang S', 'Hou P']","[""Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Xi'an 710061, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130510,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/04/11 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-8981(13)00196-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2013.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2013 Sep 23;424:53-65. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2013.05.002.

However, prophylaxis was routinely used in early studies, and molecular diagnostic tools were not employed. The objective of this study was to review the incidence of PJP during and post-FCR in the era of highly sensitive molecular diagnostics and (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-computerised tomography (CT). METHODS: All patients treated with standard FCR at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (March 2009 to June 2012) were identified from a medications management database. Laboratory-confirmed PJP cases during this time were identified from an electronic database. RESULTS: Overall, 66 patients were treated with a median of 5.5 FCR cycles. Eight PJP cases were identified, 6 of whom had received chemotherapy prior to FCR. In 5 cases, (18) F-FDG PET demonstrated bilateral ground-glass infiltrates. Median CD4(+) lymphocyte counts at time of PJP diagnosis and 9-12 months following FCR were 123 and 400 cells/muL, respectively. In patients receiving no prophylaxis, 9.1% developed PJP during FCR. The rate following FCR was 18.4%, with median onset at 6 months (2.4-24 months). CONCLUSION: Given the high rate of late-onset PJP, consideration should be given for extended PJP prophylaxis for up to 12 months post-FCR, particularly in pretreated patients. Further evaluation of the role of CD4(+) monitoring is warranted to quantify risk of disease development and to guide duration of prophylaxis.","['Haeusler, Gabrielle M', 'Slavin, Monica A', 'Seymour, John F', 'Lingaratnam, Senthil', 'Teh, Benjamin W', 'Tam, Constantine S', 'Thursky, Karin A', 'Worth, Leon J']","['Haeusler GM', 'Slavin MA', 'Seymour JF', 'Lingaratnam S', 'Teh BW', 'Tam CS', 'Thursky KA', 'Worth LJ']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Infection Control, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Vic, Australia. haeusler@petermac.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130615,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Pneumocystis carinii', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",PMC7163499,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12135 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Aug;91(2):157-63. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12135.

However, a detailed mechanism of action of As(2)S(2) is not sufficiently documented. The effects of As(2)S(2) on HL-60 cells were therefore investigated by focusing on proliferation, differentiation, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). As(2)S(2) at 0.5-8 muM induced cell differentiation based on an increment in CD11b expression, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-positive cells and cell size change. A transient increase in ROS level along with intracellular GSH level was also observed. p38 MAPK activation gradually increased after ROS generation and was sustained during cell differentiation.

We investigated the distinct roles of AMPK alpha1 and alpha2 in the survival of HPASMCs during hypoxia and hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH). The exposure of HPASMCs to hypoxia (3% O2) increased AMPK activation and phosphorylation, and the inhibition of AMPK with Compound C during hypoxia decreased their viability and increased lactate dehydrogenase activity and apoptosis. Although the suppression of either AMPK alpha1 or alpha2 expression led to increased cell death, the suppression of AMPK alpha2 alone increased caspase-3 activity and apoptosis in HPASMCs exposed to hypoxia. It also resulted in the decreased expression of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1). The knockdown of MCL-1 or MCL-1 inhibitors increased caspase-3 activity and apoptosis in HPASMCs exposed to hypoxia. On the other hand, the suppression of AMPK alpha1 expression alone prevented hypoxia-mediated autophagy. The inhibition of autophagy induced cell death in HPASMCs. Our results suggest that AMPK alpha1 and AMPK alpha2 play differential roles in the survival of HPASMCs during hypoxia. The activation of AMPK alpha2 maintains the expression of MCL-1 and prevents apoptosis, whereas the activation of AMPK alpha1 stimulates autophagy, promoting HPASMC survival. Moreover, treatment with Compound C, which inhibits both isoforms of AMPK, prevented and partly reversed hypoxia-induced PH in mice. Taking these results together, our study suggests that AMPK plays a key role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension, and AMPK may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.","['Ibe, Joyce Christina F', 'Zhou, Qiyuan', 'Chen, Tianji', 'Tang, Haiyang', 'Yuan, Jason X-J', 'Raj, J Usha', 'Zhou, Guofei']","['Ibe JC', 'Zhou Q', 'Chen T', 'Tang H', 'Yuan JX', 'Raj JU', 'Zhou G']",['1 Department of Pediatrics.'],['eng'],"['R01 HL075187/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 HL110829/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL110829/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL075187/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '10K52CIC1Z (dorsomorphin)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/*metabolism', 'Hypoxia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Artery/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",PMC3824043,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1165/rcmb.2012-0446OC [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2013 Oct;49(4):609-18. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2012-0446OC.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that most of these SNPs map to non-coding regions of the genome, it suggests that the functional basis of many GWAS signals will be through differential gene expression. By referencing publically accessible expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data on lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) we have globally demonstrated an association between GWAS P-values and eQTLs, consistent with much of the variation in CLL risk being defined by variants impacting on gene expression. To explore using eQTL data to select GWAS SNPs for replication, we genotyped rs2072135 (GWAS P-value = 0.0024, eQTL P-value = 1.510(-19)) in five independent case-control series totalling 1968 cases and 3538 controls. While not attaining statistical significance (combined P-value = 1 x 10(-4)), rs2072135 defines a promising risk locus for CLL.

These two diseases have recently been considered to be related to cell-mediated autoimmune reactions. Immunohistochemistry revealed accumulation of CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells around hair bulbs in alopecic lesions. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis showed the elevated frequency of CD8+ human leukocyte antigen DR+ -activated T cells at the initial time and declined at the hair regrowth phase with HAM. CD4+ CD25+ adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells were elevated at hair loss phase and decreased after improvement of hair loss. These results suggest that autoreactive and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells induce not only alopecia areata but also HAM in ATL patients. This case highlights that the autoimmune reactions may play an important role in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata and HAM.","['Ito, Taisuke', 'Shimada, Shinichiro', 'Mori, Tatsuyoshi', 'Tokura, Yoshiki']","['Ito T', 'Shimada S', 'Mori T', 'Tokura Y']","['Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, USA. itoutai@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,,IM,"['Adult', 'Alopecia Areata/*immunology', 'Female', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*complications']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2013/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/1346-8138.12128 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2013 May;40(5):399-401. doi: 10.1111/1346-8138.12128.,['(c) 2013 Japanese Dermatological Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other laboratory results indicated no specific abnormalities except for serum antinuclear antibody titer (1:640), glucose (1.39 g/L), and hemoglobin A1c (7.7%) levels. Computed tomography indicated multiple small enlarged lymph nodes (<1 cm in diameter) in both the axillary and inguinal areas, a cutaneous nodule (1.5 cm in diameter) in the left suboccipital area, and mild hepatosplenomegaly. Bone marrow examination revealed hypercellular marrow that consisted of 2.4% neoplastic lymphoid cells. The neoplastic lymphoid cells exhibited a medium size, irregularly shaped nuclei, a moderate amount of cytoplasm, and large granules in the cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated CD3(+), CD4(+), T-cell receptor betaF1(+), granzyme B(+), and TIA1(+). Flow cytometric analysis of the neoplastic lymphoid cells revealed CD3+, cytoplasmic CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD7(+).

N-ras mutations result in a constitutively active N-ras protein that induces uncontrolled cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. We analyzed N-ras mutations in adult patients with AML at a particular institution and compared pyrosequencing analysis with a direct sequencing method for the detection of N-ras mutations. METHODS: We analyzed 90 bone marrow samples from 83 AML patients. We detected N-ras mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 using the pyrosequencing method and subsequently confirmed all data by direct sequencing. Using these methods, we screened the N-ras mutation quantitatively and determined the incidence and characteristic of N-ras mutation. RESULTS: The incidence of N-ras mutation was 7.2% in adult AML patients. The patients with N-ras mutations showed significant higher hemoglobin levels (P=0.022) and an increased incidence of FLT3 mutations (P=0.003). We observed 3 cases with N-ras mutations in codon 12 (3.6%), 2 cases in codon 13 (2.4%), and 1 case in codon 61 (1.2%). All the mutations disappeared during chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: There is a low incidence (7.2%) of N-ras mutations in AML patients compared with other populations. Similar data is obtained by both pyrosequencing and direct sequencing. This study showed the correlation between the N-ras mutation and the therapeutic response. However, pyrosequencing provides quantitative data and is useful for monitoring therapeutic responses.","['Jeong, Ji Hun', 'Park, Soon Ho', 'Park, Mi Jung', 'Kim, Moon Jin', 'Kim, Kyung Hee', 'Park, Pil Whan', 'Seo, Yiel Hea', 'Lee, Jae Hoon', 'Park, Jinny', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Ahn, Jeong Yeal']","['Jeong JH', 'Park SH', 'Park MJ', 'Kim MJ', 'Kim KH', 'Park PW', 'Seo YH', 'Lee JH', 'Park J', 'Hong J', 'Ahn JY']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130417,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Codon', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",PMC3646189,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2013.33.3.159 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2013 May;33(3):159-66. doi: 10.3343/alm.2013.33.3.159.

However, complete response (CR) and overall response (OR) rates with Chl are relatively low. We now investigated whether the addition of Rituximab to Chl will improve the efficacy without impairing the tolerability in elderly and unfit patients. We included in our study 27 elderly or unfit patients that had not received prior therapy. All patients were treated with Chl (1mg/Kg per 28-day cycle for 8 cycles) plus Rituximab (375 mg/m(2) for the first course and 500 mg/m(2) for subsequent cycles until the 6(th) cycle). We obtained an OR rate of 74%. The most frequent adverse effect was grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurred in 18.5% of the patients. Infections or grade 3-4 extra-hematological side effects were not recorded. None of the patients required reduction of dose, delay of therapy or hospitalization.

The most common manifestation is autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, followed by immune thrombocytopenia and only rarely pure red blood cell aplasia or autoimmune granulocytopenia. Initial treatment is as for the idiopathic autoimmune cytopenias, with most patients responding to conventional corticosteroid therapy. Patients, who do not respond to conventional therapy after 4-6 weeks, should be considered for alternative immunosuppression, monoclonal antibody therapy or splenectomy. While randomized trials demonstrating the benefit of rituximab in CLL-related autoimmune diseases are still lacking, there are considerable data in the literature that provide evidence for its effectiveness. The monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab also displays considerable activity against both the malignant disease and the autoimmune complication in patients with CLL, although at the expense of greater toxicity. A number of new monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, GA-101, lumiliximab, TRU-016, epratuzumab, and galiximab, are currently investigated in CLL and their activity in CLL-related autoimmune cytopenias should be evaluated in future studies.","['Laurenti, Luca', 'Vannata, Barbara', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Autore, Francesco', 'Santini, Francesco', 'Sica, Simona', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Laurenti L', 'Vannata B', 'Innocenti I', 'Autore F', 'Santini F', 'Sica S', 'Efremov DG']","['Department of Hematology, Catholic University of Rome, ""A.

We aim to assess demographics, prognostic factors, and outcome of ALL therapy at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) in Jordan, and to compare the efficacy of two protocols. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of adults diagnosed and treated for ALL at KHCC from January, 2007 to December, 2011. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period, 108 patients with ALL were treated (66 with the Hyper-CVAD regimen, and 42 with the CALGB 8811 regimen). Median age at diagnosis was 33 years, with 63% males. The most common immunophenotype was CD10-positive common ALL, and 16% have BCR-ABL translocation. Complete response (CR) rate was 88%. After a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 10-72 months), the median survival (MS) was 30 months, and CR duration (CRD) was 28 months. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of BCR-ABL translocation was the only poor prognostic factor with lower MS of 23 months (p<0.01). There was no difference in MS or CRD between the two used regimens. CONCLUSION: International protocols for adult ALL were successfully applied to our patients. There is no difference in efficacy between Hyper-CVAD and CALGB 8811 regimens.

Acute leukemias are due to an anomaly of the stem cell characterized among other things by the expression of CD34(+) CD38(-) surface markers. This CD34(+) CD38(-) phenotype as well as other factors such as tumor syndrome, high leukocytosis and blasts are considered as important factors of poor prognosis. We therefore proposed to investigate the prognostic value of the expression of CD34(+) CD38(-) markers in acute leukemias in Abidjan. METHODS: We selected 23 patients aged 33 years on whom we performed Complete Blood Count, bone marrow aspiration and immunophenotyping. To search for myeloperoxydase, smears of blood or bone marrow were stained with benzidine and revealed by the use of Hydrogen peroxide. Acute leukemias were then identified and distributed using the score proposed by the European Group for the Immunological characterization of Leukemias. The definitive diagnosis was made by combining morphological characters that serve as the basis for the French-American-British classification as well as cytochemical and immunophenotypic characters. RESULTS: According to the cytological and immunophenotypic classifications, the acute lymphoid leukemia 2 and B IV predominated. 52.2% (12/33) of patients were CD34(+) CD38(-). This phenotype was found in almost all cytological immunophenotypic types. The medullary invasion by blasts (reflection of the tumor mass) of the total sample of CD34(+), CD34(+) CD38(-) patients and those not expressing CD34(+) was respectively 79.4%, 81.25%, 83.3% and 74.8%. CONCLUSION: There was therefore no correlation between medullary blasts and the expression of CD34(+) CD38(-). To the factors we selected it would have been necessary to associate the study of cytogenetic and molecular anomalies to better understand the role of CD34(+) CD38(-) phenotype, concerning prognosis.","['Sawadogo, Duni', 'Tolo, Aissata', 'Kassi, Hermance', 'Sangare, Mahawa', 'Inwoley, Andre']","['Sawadogo D', 'Tolo A', 'Kassi H', 'Sangare M', 'Inwoley A']",['Department of Hematology.

Acquired data were processed by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify potential biomarkers. Comparing 8a-treated CCRF-CEM leukemia cells with vehicle control (DMSO), 23 distinct metabolites involved in five metabolic pathways were identified. Metabolites from glutathione (GSH) and glycerophospholipid metabolism were investigated in detail, and results showed that GSH level and the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio were significantly decreased in 8a-treated cells, while L-cysteinyl-glycine (L-Cys-Gly) and glutamate were greatly increased. In glycerophospholipid metabolism, cell membrane components phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were decreased in 8a-treated cells, while the oxidative products lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were significantly increased. We further found that in 8a-treated cells, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) were notably increased, accompanied with decrease of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome C and activation of caspase-3. Taken together our results suggest that the acridone derivative 8a induces oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. The UPLC/Q-TOF MS based metabolomic approach provides novel insights into the mechanistic studies of antitumor drugs from a point distinct from traditional biological investigations.","['Wang, Yini', 'Gao, Dan', 'Chen, Zhe', 'Li, Shangfu', 'Gao, Chunmei', 'Cao, Deliang', 'Liu, Feng', 'Liu, Hongxia', 'Jiang, Yuyang']","['Wang Y', 'Gao D', 'Chen Z', 'Li S', 'Gao C', 'Cao D', 'Liu F', 'Liu H', 'Jiang Y']","['Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130507,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (2-aminoacetamido-10-(3, 5-dimethoxy)benzyl-9(10H)-acridone)', '0 (Acridines)', '0 (Acridones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '6BK306GUQA (acridone)']",IM,"['Acridines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Acridones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', '*Metabolomics', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",PMC3646819,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0063572 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-31996 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 May 7;8(5):e63572. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0063572.

Translocation identification is often vital in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of malignancies. A variety of methods including metaphase cytogenetics, in situ hybridization, microarray techniques, Southern blotting, and many variations of PCR are used to identify translocations. While all these techniques have utility, many have drawbacks limiting their clinical usefulness: high cost, slow turnaround time, low density, large sample requirements, high complexity, and difficult validation and standardization. Multiplexed RT-PCR combined with liquid bead array detection overcomes many of these limitations, allowing simultaneous amplification and detection of multiple translocations within one patient sample. This system has high reliability, reproducibility, and flexibility; low cost and low complexity; rapid turnaround time; and appropriate analyte density. Recently, Asuragen Inc. has developed a multiplexed RT-PCR liquid bead array panel that simultaneously analyzes 12 fusion transcripts found in four major types of hematologic malignancies, allowing rapid and efficient diagnosis.

PCR-based methods to identify and quantitate the tumor-specific BCR-ABL1 RNA have been shown to be an ultrasensitive diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring tool for Philadelphia-positive leukemias. A novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, has been confirmed as an effective targeted treatment in most CML patients. However, a significant minority of patients being treated with imatinib develop resistance to the drug as evidenced by rising BCR-ABL1 levels. The most common mechanism of resistance in these patients is the development of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) that abrogate binding of imatinib. Although KD mutations are quite heterogeneous, the identification of the exact mutation site is clinically important, as some mutations, but not others, can be effectively treated with second-generation TKIs. One mutation, T315I, for example, renders the leukemia resistant to all first- and second-line TKIs. Thus, DNA sequencing of the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain in resistant patients helps identify those who may benefit from a change in TKI agents, or those who should be considered for other therapeutic measures, such as stem cell transplantation.

A consensus goal for TKI treatment is to achieve a major molecular response (MMR), defined as a 3-log (1,000-fold) reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts. Patients who achieve an MMR have been shown to have a significantly reduced risk of disease progression. Conversely, increasing post-therapy BCR-ABL1 RNA levels convey a significantly increased risk of disease progression. The early identification of these high-risk patients may allow early changes to the therapeutic strategy, before frank relapse.

The tyrosine kinase Abl is activated in neurodegeneration. Here, we show that lentiviral expression of alpha-synuclein in the mouse SN leads to Abl activation (phosphorylation) and lentiviral Abl expression increases alpha-synuclein levels, in agreement with Abl activation in PD brains. Administration of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib decreases Abl activity and ameliorates autophagic clearance of alpha-synuclein in transgenic and lentiviral gene transfer models. Subcellular fractionation shows accumulation of alpha-synuclein and hyper-phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) in autophagic vacuoles in alpha-synuclein expressing brains, but nilotinib enhances protein deposition into the lysosomes. Nilotinib is used for adult leukemia treatment and it enters the brain within US Food and Drug Administration approved doses, leading to autophagic degradation of alpha-synuclein, protection of SN neurons and amelioration of motor performance. These data suggest that nilotinib may be a therapeutic strategy to degrade alpha-synuclein in PD and other alpha-synucleinopathies.","['Hebron, Michaeline L', 'Lonskaya, Irina', 'Moussa, Charbel E-H']","['Hebron ML', 'Lonskaya I', 'Moussa CE']","['Department of Neuroscience, Laboratory for Dementia and Parkinsonism, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20057, USA.']",['eng'],['30378/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130510,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (alpha-Synuclein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dopamine/*metabolism', 'Dopaminergic Neurons/*drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Parkinsonian Disorders/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Substantia Nigra/metabolism', 'alpha-Synuclein/blood/*metabolism']",PMC3723316,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['ddt192 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddt192 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2013 Aug 15;22(16):3315-28. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddt192.

Three of these compounds, mHA1, mHA6, and mHA11, showed in vitro cytotoxicities against tumor cells that were more potent and more stable than the backbone compound HA14-1, with nM IC50 values. In contrast, the cytotoxic effects of these compounds on normal cells were minimal. Computational docking, colchicine-tubulin competitive binding, and tubulin polymerization studies demonstrated that these compounds bind at the colchicine-binding site on tubulin and inhibit the formation of microtubules. Treatment of HL-60/Bcl-2 leukemia and CRL5908 lung cancer cells with these mHA compounds led to pronounced microtubule density decreases, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and DNA fragmentation analysis. Combined, these data identify a novel class of compounds that inhibit tubulin assembly and limit cancer cell phenotypes. IMPLICATIONS: This study supports the continued development of novel anti-tubulin assembly inhibitors as potential anticancer agents.","['Xi, Jingle', 'Zhu, Xuejun', 'Feng, Yongmei', 'Huang, Na', 'Luo, Guifen', 'Mao, Yongjun', 'Han, Xiaofeng', 'Tian, Wang', 'Wang, Guirong', 'Han, Xiaobing', 'Luo, Rongcheng', 'Huang, Ziwei', 'An, Jing']","['Xi J', 'Zhu X', 'Feng Y', 'Huang N', 'Luo G', 'Mao Y', 'Han X', 'Tian W', 'Wang G', 'Han X', 'Luo R', 'Huang Z', 'An J']","['Department of Pharmacology, SUNY Upstate Cancer Research Institute, State University of New York, 750 East Adams Street, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA. anji@upstate.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130510,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzopyrans/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colchicine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Discovery', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Nitriles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/04/16 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-12-0177 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0177 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2013 Aug;11(8):856-64. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0177.

High-dose cytarabine (HD araC) therapy resulted from a theoretical model developed in the 1970s that attempted to maximize the anti-leukemia effect of cytarabine. Since that time, HD araC has been utilized mostly in consolidation therapy for AML and in patients with relapsed or resistant AML. The development of araC and HD araC preceded our current understanding of AML biology-that it is a heterogeneous disease, not a single clinical entity. Thus, the optimal dose, schedule, and clinical setting for the use of cytarabine in hematologic malignancies remain uncertain. Research is now better defining the optimal use of HD araC based on leukemia cell karyotype and molecular signature. Here we review the pharmacodynamics of araC, the landmark studies that established the role of HD araC in AML, and research defining the role of HD araC based on the unique biologic properties of the leukemia cell.","['Reese, Nicholas D', 'Schiller, Gary J']","['Reese ND', 'Schiller GJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, 757 Westwood Plaza, Suite 7501, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. nreese@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/methods', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-013-0156-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2013 Jun;8(2):141-8. doi: 10.1007/s11899-013-0156-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to evaluate feline haemoplasma prevalence using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a convenience sample of New Zealand domestic cats, including blood film examination and a risk factor analysis. DNA was extracted from 200 blood samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for routine haematology over a 12-month period. Species-specific real-time PCR assays identified 62 cats that were positive for haemoplasma DNA, giving an overall prevalence of 31%. Twelve of the positive cats had dual infections. The prevalence of the three feline haemoplasmas was 25% for 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum', 7.5% for Mycoplasma haemofelis and 4.5% for 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' (CMt). All samples were positive for an internal control (feline 28S rDNA) by real-time PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of blood smear examination for haemoplasma infection in this study was 9.7% and 97.8%, respectively. Retroviral infection was tested using the Idexx Snap Feline Triple test on all samples. Twenty cats (10%) were feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) positive and 11 cats (5.5%) were feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) positive. Statistical comparisons, using multivariate logistic regression, indicated that positive FIV status, male gender and non-pedigree breed were significantly (P <0.05) associated with haemoplasma infection, with odds ratios of 10.16, 5.04 and 3.03, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate the prevalence of the three main feline haemoplasma species in New Zealand for the first time, with prevalences correlating with previous overseas studies.

Treatment of SGC7901/ADR cells with beta-elemene led to downregulation of Akt phosphorylation and significant upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, c-Cbl and Cbl-b. Importantly, beta-elemene significantly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of DOX in nude mice bearing SGC7901/ADR xenografts.

Both isoforms are present within the nucleus, but in contrast to PLCbeta1a, the vast majority of PLCbeta1b is nuclear. In mouse erythroid leukemia cells, PI-PLCbeta1 is involved in the regulation of cell division and the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. It has been demonstrated that nuclear localization is crucial for the enzymatic function of PI-PLCbeta1, although the mechanism by which this nuclear import occurs has never been fully characterized. The aim of this study was to characterize both the mechanism of nuclear localization and the molecular function of nuclear PI-PLCbeta1 by identifying its interactome in Friend's erythroleukemia isolated nuclei, utilizing a procedure that coupled immuno-affinity purification with tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Using this procedure, 160 proteins were demonstrated to be in association with PI-PLCbeta1b, some of which have been previously characterized, such as the splicing factor SRp20 (Srsf3) and Lamin B (Lmnb1). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of selected proteins confirmed the data obtained via mass spectrometry. Of particular interest was the identification of the nuclear import proteins Kpna2, Kpna4, Kpnb1, Ran, and Rangap1, as well as factors involved in hematological malignancies and several anti-apoptotic proteins.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying disease development are not yet fully elucidated. Here, we studied the effect of hyperuricemia on tryptophan metabolism and the potential role herein of two important uric acid efflux transporters, multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Hyperuricemia was induced in mice by treatment with the uricase inhibitor oxonic acid, confirmed by the presence of urate crystals in the urine of treated animals. A transport assay, using membrane vesicles of cells overexpressing the transporters, revealed that uric acid inhibited substrate-specific transport by BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations (calculated IC50 value: 365+/-13muM), as was previously reported for MRP4. Moreover, we identified kynurenic acid as a novel substrate for MRP4 and BCRP. This finding was corroborated by increased plasma levels of kynurenic acid observed in Mrp4(-/-) (107+/-19nM; P=0.145) and Bcrp(-/-) mice (133+/-10nM; P=0.0007) compared to wild type animals (71+/-11nM). Hyperuricemia was associated with >1.5 fold increase in plasma kynurenine levels in all strains. Moreover, hyperuricemia led to elevated plasma kynurenic acid levels (128+/-13nM, P=0.005) in wild type mice but did not further increase kynurenic acid levels in knockout mice. Based on our results, we postulate that elevated uric acid levels hamper MRP4 and BCRP functioning, thereby promoting the retention of other potentially toxic substrates, including kynurenic acid, which could contribute to the development of CKD.","['Dankers, Anita C A', 'Mutsaers, Henricus A M', 'Dijkman, Henry B P M', 'van den Heuvel, Lambertus P', 'Hoenderop, Joost G', 'Sweep, Fred C G J', 'Russel, Frans G M', 'Masereeuw, Rosalinde']","['Dankers AC', 'Mutsaers HA', 'Dijkman HB', 'van den Heuvel LP', 'Hoenderop JG', 'Sweep FC', 'Russel FG', 'Masereeuw R']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '5VT6420TIG (Oxonic Acid)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'H030S2S85J (Kynurenic Acid)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Kynurenic Acid/metabolism', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxonic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Tryptophan/*metabolism', 'Uric Acid/metabolism']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4439(13)00156-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Oct;1832(10):1715-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.05.002.

Our group previously identified the 7,8-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (DHMC) as a potential chemotherapeutic agent due to its potent, selective anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on several cancer cell lines over peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, there are still no published reports that can explain such selectivity of action. Herein, we addressed this question by using the U-937 promonocytic leukemia cell line, which can be forced to differentiate into a monocyte-like phenotype in vitro. U-937 cells differentiation is dependent on the nuclear expression of p21(Cip1/WAF1), a protein that is absent in immature U-937 cells but present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of normal DHMC-resistant monocytes. Considering that induction of differentiation rendered U-937 cells resistant to DHMC, we evaluated the possible causal role of cytoplasmic p21(Cip1/WAF1) in the onset of such resistance by employing U-937 cells stably transfected with a ZnCl2-inducible p21(Cip1/WAF1) variant lacking the nuclear localization signal (U-937/CB6-DeltaNLS-p21 cells). Expression of cytoplasmic p21(Cip1/WAF1) did not induce differentiation of the cells but turned them resistant to DHMC through inhibition of JNK, a crucial mediator of DHMC-induced apoptosis in U-937 cells. Sub-acute toxicity evaluation of DHMC in Balb/c mice indicated that DHMC administered intraperitoneally at doses up to 100mg/kg induced no systemic damage. Collectively, our results explain for the first time the selective cytotoxicity of DHMC for tumor cells over normal monocytes, and encourage further in vivo studies on this compound as potential anti-leukemic agent.","['Vazquez, Ramiro', 'Riveiro, Maria Eugenia', 'Mondillo, Carolina', 'Perazzo, Juan Carlos', 'Vermeulen, Monica', 'Baldi, Alberto', 'Davio, Carlos', 'Shayo, Carina']","['Vazquez R', 'Riveiro ME', 'Mondillo C', 'Perazzo JC', 'Vermeulen M', 'Baldi A', 'Davio C', 'Shayo C']","['Laboratorio de Patologia y Farmacologia Molecular, Instituto de Biologia y Medicina Experimental IBYME-CONICET, Vuelta de Obligado 2490 C1428ADN, Buenos Aires, Argentina. ramirobioq@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (7,8-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(13)00263-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2013.04.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2013 Jul 15;86(2):210-21. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2013.04.021.

In radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (rAML), a partial hemizygous deletion of mouse chromosome 2 is a common feature in several susceptible strains. The deletion is an early event detectable 24h after exposure in bone marrow cells using cytogenetic techniques. Expanding clones of bone marrow cells with chromosome 2 deletions can be detected less than a year after exposure to ionising radiation in around half of the irradiated mice. Ultimately, 15-25% of exposed animals develop AML. It is generally assumed that leukaemia originates in an early progenitor cell or haematopoietic stem cell, but it is unknown whether the original chromosome damage occurs at a similar frequency in committed progenitors and stem cells. In this study, we monitored the frequency of chromosome 2 deletions in immature bone marrow cells (Lin(-)) and haematopoietic stem cells/multipotent progenitor cells (LSK) by several techniques, fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and through use of a reporter gene model, flow cytometry and colony forming units in spleen (CFU-S) following ex vivo or in vivo exposure. We showed that partial chromosome 2 deletions are present in the LSK subpopulation, but cannot be detected in Lin(-) cells and CFU-S12 cells. Furthermore, we transplanted irradiated Lin(-) or LSK cells into host animals to determine whether specific irradiated cell populations acquire an increased proliferative advantage compared to unirradiated cells. Interestingly, the irradiated LSK subpopulation containing cells carrying chromosome 2 deletions does not appear to repopulate as well as the unirradiated population, suggesting that the chromosomal deletion does not provide an advantage for growth and in vivo repopulation, at least at early stages following occurrence.","['Olme, C-H', 'Brown, N', 'Finnon, R', 'Bouffler, S D', 'Badie, C']","['Olme CH', 'Brown N', 'Finnon R', 'Bouffler SD', 'Badie C']","['Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics Group, Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 ORQ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'X-Rays']",PMC4028086,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(13)00120-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2013.04.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2013 Aug 30;756(1-2):119-26. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2013.04.018.

Our data for the first time shows that ecotropic viral integration site I binds to DeltaNp63 promoter element directly and down regulates its expression. Down regulation of DeltaNp63 induces the expression of p21 in HT-29 cells and also in colon carcinoma cells that do not express p53 including patient samples expressing low level of p53, that eventually delay cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase. Concomitant silencing of ecotropic viral integration site I from the cells or introduction of DeltaNp63 to the cells significantly rescued this phenotype, indicating the growth defect induced by DeltaNp63 deficiency to be, at least in part, attributable to ecotropic viral integration site I function.

It is well accepted that during learning and memory formation the dynamic establishment of new active synaptic connections is crucial. Persistent synaptic activation leads to molecular events that include increased release of neurotransmitters, increased expression of receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, thus creating a positive feedback that results in the activation of distinct signaling pathways that temporally and permanently alter specific patterns of gene expression. However, the epigenetic changes that allow the establishment of long term genetic programs that control learning and memory are not completely understood. Even less is known regarding the signaling events triggered by synaptic activity that regulate these epigenetic marks. Here we review the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling activity-dependent gene transcription leading synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We describe how Ca(2+) entry through N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate neurotransmitter receptors result in the activation of specific signaling pathways leading to changes in gene expression, giving special emphasis to the recent data pointing out different epigenetic mechanisms (histone acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation as well as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation) underlying learning and memory.","['Cortes-Mendoza, Javier', 'Diaz de Leon-Guerrero, Sol', 'Pedraza-Alva, Gustavo', 'Perez-Martinez, Leonor']","['Cortes-Mendoza J', 'Diaz de Leon-Guerrero S', 'Pedraza-Alva G', 'Perez-Martinez L']","['Laboratorio de Neuroinmunobiologia, Departamento de Medicina Molecular y Bioprocesos, Instituto de Biotecnologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico UNAM, Cuernavaca, Morelos 62271, Mexico.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130509,United States,Int J Dev Neurosci,International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,8401784,"['0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Synapses/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/02/15 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0736-5748(13)00057-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2013.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Neurosci. 2013 Oct;31(6):359-69. doi: 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2013.04.003.

The mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) region represents one of the best prognostic markers and defines 2 disease subgroups: mutated (M-CLL) and unmutated (UM-CLL), with different clinical course. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IGHV-D-J gene rearrangements and mutational status were analyzed in 73 Argentinian patients with CLL, 22 previously treated, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and bidirectional sequencing. The results were compared with those reported in other geographic regions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was also performed. RESULTS: A total of 43 (58.9%) cases were of patients with M-CLL, and 30 (41.1%) were patients with UM-CLL. Deletion of chromosome 13q14 as a single alteration was more frequently observed in the M-CLL group (48%) than in the UM-CLL group (24%). In the M-CLL group, the proportion of cases with deletion of chromosome 13q14 was significantly higher than those with +12 and those with deletions of chromosomes 17p and 11q (P = .003). The most frequently used IGHV families were IGHV3 > IGHV1 > IGHV4, which are different from those observed in Asian, Brazilian, and Uruguayan series. The IGHV3-23 gene (10.8%) was the most commonly used, followed by IGHV1-69 (9.5%), IGHV4-59 and IGHV2-5 (6.8% each), and IGHV3-21 and IGHV3-30 (5.4% each). IGHV4-34 showed the lowest frequency (2.7%) in our cohort compared with published data, whereas IGHV4-59, IGHV3-72, and IGHV2-5 were overexpressed in our series. Stereotyped HCDR3 (heavy chain complementary determining region 3) was found in 9.5% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that Argentinian patients with CLL display an IGHV gene usage that resembles that observed in Western countries and exhibited interesting similarities and differences with respect to published series from other Latin American populations, which reflect variations in the genetic background.","['Stanganelli, Carmen', 'Travella, Ana', 'Bezares, Raimundo', 'Slavutsky, Irma']","['Stanganelli C', 'Travella A', 'Bezares R', 'Slavutsky I']","['Laboratorio de Genetica de Neoplasias Linfoides, Instituto de Medicina Experimental CONICET- Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Argentina', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(13)00048-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2013.02.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Aug;13(4):447-457.e2. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2013.02.019.

We report here results in 100 adults, ages 18 to 69, with high-risk hematologic malignancy who received conditioning with fludarabine, carmustine, melphalan, and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (FBM-A). Outcomes were stratified using the disease risk index (DRI) as published by Armand et al. (Blood 2012;120:905-913). Median age was 56, and patients were ineligible for standard myeloablative conditioning because of age, organ dysfunction, or prior autologous HCT. Patients underwent transplantation for myeloid (acute myelogenous leukemia, n = 40; myelodysplastic syndrome, n = 24; myelofibrosis, n = 13; other myeloid, n = 2) or lymphoid (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 8; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 8; Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 4, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, n = 1) malignancy. Donors were related in 26 patients (22 matched, 4 mismatched at 1 antigen) and unrelated in 74 (mismatched at 1 or 2 HLA loci in 33); grafts were peripheral blood stem cells in 97 patients, bone marrow in 2, and double cord in 1. According to the DRI, 68 patients were classified as low (n = 1) or intermediate risk (n = 67), and 32 were classified as high (n = 28) or very high risk (n = 4). With a median follow-up of surviving patients of 18 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival at 2 years for patients in the low/intermediate risk group is 80%, compared with 66% in the high/very high group (P = .11). Two-year cumulative incidence of relapse and nonrelapse mortality in the low/intermediate group are 9.9% and 15%, versus 25% and 19% in the high/very high group (respective P values .07 and .81). The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host (GVHD) grades III to IV at 100 days was 8.1%, and the incidence of National Institutes of Health-defined moderate to severe chronic GVHD was 22% at 2 years. No deaths were attributable to chronic GVHD. Survival was not influenced by age, hematopoietic comorbidity index score, donor type, donor gender, or presence of mismatch. We conclude that FBM-A is an effective and safe conditioning regimen for adults up to age 69 with hematologic malignancies who have low-, intermediate-, or high-risk scores according to the DRI.","['Slack, James L', 'Dueck, Amylou C', 'Fauble, Veena D', 'Sproat, Lisa O', 'Reeder, Craig B', 'Noel, Pierre', 'Khera, Nandita', 'Betcher, Jeffery A', 'Klein, Jared L', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Adams, Roberta H']","['Slack JL', 'Dueck AC', 'Fauble VD', 'Sproat LO', 'Reeder CB', 'Noel P', 'Khera N', 'Betcher JA', 'Klein JL', 'Leis JF', 'Adams RH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ 85054, USA. slack.james@mayo.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130507,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(13)00196-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Aug;19(8):1167-74. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.05.001.

METHODS: Twenty patients aged 3-15 years undergoing chemotherapy seen at a referral center for cancer treatment in the State of Maranhao, Brazil, from 2008 to 2009, were evaluated at baseline (1st). Twenty-two controls were selected in public schools. Oral lesions, caries experience (deft and DMFT), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and salivary IgA were analyzed. Patients and controls were evaluated after 6 months (2nd). The Shapiro Wilk, Mann-Whitney, Wilkoxon and Spearman correlation tests were carried out (alpha=5%). RESULTS: Gingivitis and mucositis were the most frequent manifestations in oral mucosae during the two phases. The mean DMFT index increased from 3.9 +/- 4.2 (1st) to 4.4 +/- 4.3 (2nd) (p = 0.04). The mean deft index was the same in the 1st (1.9 +/- 2.7) and 2nd (1.9 +/- 2.7) evaluation (p = 0.86). The GI also did not vary between assessments: 1st (1.3 +/- 0.4) and 2nd (1.3 +/- 0.3) - (p = 0.12), except on the lingual and distal surfaces, where increased from the 1st to 2nd evaluation (p < 0.01). The PI varied from 0.9 to 1.1, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.48), except for the lingual surface, where increased from 0.6 to 1.0 (p = 0.04). There was a reduction in salivary IgA levels from 2.9 to 1.9 mug/mL (p = 0.04), and mean IgA was significantly higher in the control group (5.4 mug/mL) if compared to cases (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The clinical and immunological oral conditions of children and adolescents undergoing ATL presented an unfavorable evolution. This study highlights the need for monitoring oral conditions during the ATL and draws attention to the additional responsibility of the otolaryngologist in referring ATL patients to the dentist, especially in the presence of clinical evidence of oral problems. We suggest that the planning of ATL take into account the oral health, in a multidisciplinary oncology team.","['Thomaz, Erika Barbara Abreu Fonseca', 'Mouchrek, Jose Carlos Elias Jr', 'Silva, Adriana Quinzeiro', 'Guerra, Rosane Nassar Meireles', 'Liberio, Silvana Amado', 'da Cruz, Maria Carmen Fontoura Nogueira', 'Pereira, Antonio Luis Amaral']","['Thomaz EB', 'Mouchrek JC Jr', 'Silva AQ', 'Guerra RN', 'Liberio SA', 'da Cruz MC', 'Pereira AL']","['Department of Public Health, Federal University from Maranhao, Sao Luis, MA, Brazil. ebthomaz@globo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130510,Ireland,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,8003603,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/03/14 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-5876(13)00155-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijporl.2013.03.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2013 Jul;77(7):1088-93. doi: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2013.03.037.

However, their efficacy has not been tested in a multicentre randomised controlled trial in a large population. We assessed the efficacy and safety of homoharringtonine-based induction treatment for management of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: This open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study was done in 17 institutions in China between September, 2007, and July, 2011. Untreated patients aged 14-59 years with acute myeloid leukaemia were randomly assigned (by a computer-generated allocation schedule without stratification) to receive one of three induction regimens in a 1:1:1 ratio: homoharringtonine 2 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-7, cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-7, and aclarubicin 20 mg/day on days 1-7 (HAA); homoharringtonine 2 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-7, cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-7, and daunorubicin 40 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-3 (HAD); or daunorubicin 40-45 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-3 and cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-7 (DA). Patients in complete remission were offered two cycles of intermediate-dose cytarabine (2 g/m(2) every 12 h on days 1-3). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission after two cycles of induction treatment and event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, number ChiCTR-TRC-06000054. FINDINGS: We enrolled 620 patients, of whom 609 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. 150 of 206 patients (73%) in the HAA group achieved complete remission versus 125 of 205 (61%) in the DA group (p=0.0108); 3-year event-free survival was 35.4% (95% CI 28.6-42.2) versus 23.1% (95% CI 17.4-29.3; p=0.0023). 133 of 198 patients (67%) in the HAD group had complete remission (vs DA, p=0.20) and 3-year event-free survival was 32.7% (95% CI 26.1-39.5; vs DA, p=0.08). Adverse events were much the same in all groups, except that more patients in the HAA (12 of 206 [5.8%]) and HAD (13 of 198 [6.6%]) groups died within 30 days than in the DA group (two of 205 [1%]; p=0.0067 vs HAA; p=0.0030 vs HAD).

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was considered the treatment of choice, however, recent data have indicated that chemotherapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) maybe an alternative effective therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children (<18 years) with Ph+ ALL who were treated at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) from January 2003 till December 2011. RESULTS: Over a 9 year period, 411 children were diagnosed and treated for ALL at KHCC. Twenty three (6.6%) had Ph+ ALL; 16 males and 7 females. Median age at diagnosis was 9.5 years (range 1.67-17). The median white blood cell count was 58.6x10(3)/muL (range 1.6-459). Twelve patients underwent HSCT from a full matched related donor; and 10 were treated with intensive chemotherapy plus TKI (imatinib). Those who underwent HSCT were significantly older (P=0.004) and had a higher leukocyte count at diagnosis (P=0.53). After a median follow up of 42.2 months (range 12.7-107), the estimated 5 year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 75% and 91.6%, respectively, for those who underwent HSCT as primary therapy and 49.3% and 83.3%, respectively, for those treated with chemotherapy plus imatinib. There was no significant difference in EFS (P=0.98) or OS (P=1) between the two treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that chemotherapy plus TKI may be a reasonable treatment option for some children with Ph+ ALL.","['Salami, Khadra', 'Alkayed, Khaldoun', 'Halalsheh, Hadeel', 'Hussein, Ayad Ahmed', 'Riziq, Maha', 'Madanat, Faris']","['Salami K', 'Alkayed K', 'Halalsheh H', 'Hussein AA', 'Riziq M', 'Madanat F']","['Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130326,England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1658-3876(13)00009-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.hemonc.2013.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2013 Mar;6(1):34-41. doi: 10.1016/j.hemonc.2013.03.001.

The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. Anticancer activities of synthesized compounds were evaluated on human colon, liver and leukemia cancer cell lines. Cell culture studies have demonstrated significant toxicity of the compounds on the cell lines, and the levels of toxicity have altered in the presence of various side groups.

Altersolanol A induces cell death by apoptosis through the cleavage of caspase-3 and -9 and through the decrease of anti-apoptotic protein expression. Moreover, we report here the importance of the distinct structural features of altersolanol A by testing other related anthracene derivatives in order to identify preliminary structure-activity relationships. Acetylation of altersolanol A did not improve activity where other derivatives such as tetrahydroaltersolanol B and ampelanol that differ from altersolanol A by reduction of one of a carbonyl group and removal of hydroxyl substituents were inactive in comparison.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 74-year-old woman with no prior medical history presented with necrotic leg ulcer. Skin biopsy showed dermal angiomatosis with numerous PAS+ thromboses, associated with monoclonal intravascular deposits of IgM kappa, indicating monoclonal cryoglobulin, which was confirmed by laboratory tests. Subsequent blood immunophenotyping revealed an inconspicuous circulating monoclonal CD5(+) B-cell population and small B-cell clusters in the bone marrow, while the B-cell count was normal and no lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly were present. Overall, these findings indicated a small B-cell lymphoma, classed as non-MALT marginal zone lymphoma on the WHO classification, at a very early stage of development. The patient was first treated by cyclophosphamide and oral steroids without success. Subsequent administration of six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (RCVP) led to remission of her leg ulcer, cryoglobulinaemia and lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Skin biopsies of necrotic ulcers should undergo routine screening for intravascular deposits of type 1 cryoglobulin. Leg ulcers due to monoclonal cryoglobulinaemia may reveal incipient marginal zone B-cell lymphoma at the stage of circulating monoclonal lymphocytosis.","['Lacoste, C', 'Duong, T A', 'Dupuis, J', 'Haioun, C', 'Plonquet, A', 'Copie-Bergman, C', 'Gaulard, P', 'Ortonne, N']","['Lacoste C', 'Duong TA', 'Dupuis J', 'Haioun C', 'Plonquet A', 'Copie-Bergman C', 'Gaulard P', 'Ortonne N']","['Departement de pathologie, Inserm U955 equipe 9, hopital Henri-Mondor, Assistance publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), faculte de medecine, universite Paris Est Creteil-Val-de-Marne, 51, avenue du Marechal-de-Lattre-de-Tassigny, 94010 Creteil cedex, France.']",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20130321,France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Cryoglobulins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cryoglobulinemia/*etiology', 'Cryoglobulins/analysis', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leg Ulcer/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,2013/05/15 06:00,2013/10/25 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(13)00454-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2013.01.429 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2013 May;140(5):367-72. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2013.01.429.

Bcl11b(KO) (/+) heterozygous mice are susceptible to thymic lymphomas, a model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, when gamma-irradiated, and irradiated Bcl11b(KO) (/+) mice generate clonally expanding or premalignant thymocytes before thymic lymphoma development. Cells with radiation-induced DNA damages are assumed to be the cells of origin in tumors; however, which thymocyte is the tumor cell origin remains obscure. In this study we generated Bcl11b(flox/+) ;Lck-Cre and Bcl11b(flox/+) ;CD4-Cre mice; in the former, loss of one Bcl11b allele occurs in thymocytes at the immature CD4(-) CD8(-) stage, whereas in the latter the loss occurs in the more differentiated CD4(+) CD8(+) double-positive stage. We examined clonal expansion and differentiation of thymocytes in mice 60 days after 3 Gy gamma-irradiation. Half (9/18) of the thymuses in the Bcl11b(flox/+) ;Lck-Cre group showed limited rearrangement sites at the T-cell receptor-beta (TCRbeta) locus, indicating clonal cell expansion, but none in the Bcl11b(flox/+) ;CD4-Cre group did. This indicates that the origin of the premalignant thymocytes is not in double-positive cells but immature thymocytes. Interestingly, those premalignant thymocytes underwent rearrangement at various different sites of the TCRalpha locus and the majority showed a higher expression of TCRbeta and CD8, and more differentiated phenotypes. This suggests the existence of a subpopulation of immature cells within the premalignant cells that is capable of proliferating and continuously producing differentiated thymocytes.","['Go, Rieka', 'Hirose, Satoshi', 'Katsuragi, Yoshinori', 'Obata, Miki', 'Abe, Manabu', 'Mishima, Yukio', 'Sakimura, Kenji', 'Kominami, Ryo']","['Go R', 'Hirose S', 'Katsuragi Y', 'Obata M', 'Abe M', 'Mishima Y', 'Sakimura K', 'Kominami R']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130617,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Bcl11b protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/radiation effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precancerous Conditions/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Thymocytes/metabolism/*pathology/*radiation effects', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",PMC7657184,,2013/05/15 06:00,2014/02/15 06:00,['2013/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12193 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Aug;104(8):1009-16. doi: 10.1111/cas.12193.

METHODS: A total of 35 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from 2003 to 2011. They were divided into the imatinib (n = 23) and control (n = 12) groups. The incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) of two groups were compared to identify the superiority of combined treatment. RESULTS: Age, gender, cytogenetic classification, donor type, proposed regimen and counts of infused stem cells were comparable between two groups. The proportion of patients in the first remission (CR1) in the imatinib group was higher than that in control group (20/23 vs 6/12, P = 0.038). However, single factor analysis showed that it did not affect the survival significantly (P = 0.884, 0.924). The estimated incidence of acute GVHD was 45.5% in the imatinib group versus 66.7% in the control group (P = 0.386). And the incidence of acute GVHD of Grades II-IV were 26.1% and 41.7% (P = 0.349) respectively. The estimated 5-year OS of two groups showed statistical difference (62.6% vs 41.7%, P = 0.028) and estimated 5-year DFS were 53.7% and 33.3% respectively (P = 0.054). The 5-year NRM was 41.7% in the control group and the main causes were infection and severe GVHD versus 22.7% in the imatinib group (P = 0.084) and the main cause was infection. The engraftment of white blood cell (median time: 13 vs 11 days, P = 0.008) and platelet (median time: 14 vs 11 days, P = 0.002) was delayed in imatinib group compared with control group.

Clinical trials have been conducted using L-ASNase in combination with other drugs and radiotherapy, which have led to great success in the treatment of ALL. Treatments consist of induction therapy and central nervous system therapy. The achievement of complete remission in patients is associated with a few side-effects of using L-asparaginase, including pancreatitis, coagulation abnormalities and allergic reactions. Sometimes tumor cells may develop resistance to L-ASNase. To overcome these difficulties, the drug is modified by pegylation or immobilization, and also treatment protocols can be modified to increase the efficiency of the drug.","['Kumar, Kuldeep', 'Kaur, Jagjeet', 'Walia, Shefali', 'Pathak, Teena', 'Aggarwal, Diwakar']","['Kumar K', 'Kaur J', 'Walia S', 'Pathak T', 'Aggarwal D']","['Department of Biotechnology, M.

There are studies showing that AID can cause numerous translocations in different lymphoproliferative diseases. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal B cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood. The predictability and clinical status of B-CLL are difficult to determine. About 30-50% of patients have chromosomal abnormalities. AID, which is thought to create fraction segments for translocations, might also cause deletions in DNA regions of 17p13, 11q22.3, 13q14 and 13q34 that are associated with prognostic implications in patients with CLL.

Whether LIF offers protection to the heart under chronic stress such as hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling and heart failure is not known. However, mice with cardiac myocyte restricted knockout of STAT3, a principal transcription factor activated by LIF, develop heart failure with age, and cardiac STAT3 levels are reported to be decreased in heart failure patients. In addition, endogenously produced LIF has been implicated in the cholinergic transdiffrentiation that may serve to attenuate sympathetic overdrive in heart failure and in the peri-infarct region of the heart after myocardial infarction. Surprisingly, therapeutic strategies to exploit the beneficial actions of LIF on the injured myocardium have received scant attention. Nor is it established whether the purported so-called adverse effects of LIF observed in isolated cardiac myocytes have physiological relevance in vivo. Here we present an overview of the actions of LIF in the heart with the goal of stimulating further research into the translational potential of this pleiotropic cytokine.","['Zouein, Fouad A', 'Kurdi, Mazen', 'Booz, George W']","['Zouein FA', 'Kurdi M', 'Booz GW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, and the Center for Excellence in Cardiovascular-Renal Research, The University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi 39216-4505, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL088101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01HL088101-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)']",IM,"['Acetylcholine/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cardiotonic Agents/metabolism', 'Heart Failure/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3674483,['NIHMS474445'],2013/05/11 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ecn.2013.0335 [pii]', '10.1684/ecn.2013.0335 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2013 Mar;24(1):11-9. doi: 10.1684/ecn.2013.0335.,,['NOTNLM'],"['GP130', 'JAK STAT signaling', 'cardiac remodeling', 'cholinergic transdifferentiation', 'cytokine', 'heart failure']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there remains some debate about how best to conceptualize these deficits. Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is a proposed conceptual framework that has been used to describe a subset of children with ADHD who exhibit a particular profile characterized by lethargy, day dreaming and staring, and poor organization. Previous work has suggested that survivors of leukemia exhibit a similar profile, but it has not yet been examined in survivors of pediatric brain tumors. A sample of 65 survivors of pediatric brain tumors, 25 survivors of leukemia and 50 community controls completed the Child Behavior Checklist, with four items used to measure SCT. Survivors completed additional measures of neurocognitive functioning. Survivors of brain tumors demonstrated significantly greater symptoms of SCT than survivors of leukemia or controls. SCT was associated with attention problems and working memory deficits and the presence of a VP-shunt. Results provided conditional support for the presence of SCT in survivors of brain tumors, with further research needed to determine the clinical utility of the framework.","['Willard, Victoria W', 'Hardy, Kristina K', 'Allen, Taryn M', 'Hwang, Eugene I', 'Gururangan, Sridharan', 'Hostetter, Sarah A', 'Bonner, Melanie J']","['Willard VW', 'Hardy KK', 'Allen TM', 'Hwang EI', 'Gururangan S', 'Hostetter SA', 'Bonner MJ']","['Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. victoria.willard@stjude.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130510,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*complications', 'Checklist', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors/psychology', 'Wechsler Scales']",,,2013/05/11 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-013-1149-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2013 Aug;114(1):71-8. doi: 10.1007/s11060-013-1149-8.

Here we show that p12 proteins engineered to encode peptide sequences derived from known viral tethering proteins can direct chromatin binding during the early phase of viral replication and rescue a lethal p12-PM14 mutant. Peptides studied included segments of Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)(1-23), human papillomavirus 8 E2, and prototype foamy virus chromatin-binding sequences. Amino acid substitutions in Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus LANA and prototype foamy virus chromatin-binding sequences that blocked nucleosome association failed to rescue MuLV p12-PM14. Rescue by a larger LANA peptide, LANA(1-32), required second-site mutations that are predicted to reduce peptide binding affinity to chromosomes, suggesting that excessively high binding affinity interfered with Gag/p12 function. This is supported by confocal microscopy of chimeric p12-GFP fusion constructs showing the reverted proteins had weaker association to condensed mitotic chromosomes. Analysis of the integration-site selection of these chimeric viruses showed no significant change in integration profile compared with wild-type MuLV, suggesting release of the tethered p12 post mitosis, before viral integration.","['Schneider, William M', 'Brzezinski, Jonathon D', 'Aiyer, Sriram', 'Malani, Nirav', 'Gyuricza, Mercedes', 'Bushman, Frederic D', 'Roth, Monica J']","['Schneider WM', 'Brzezinski JD', 'Aiyer S', 'Malani N', 'Gyuricza M', 'Bushman FD', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI082020/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008360/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM088808/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI082020/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM070837/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM088808/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI52845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130509,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gag protein p12, moloney murine leukemia virus)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (latency-associated nuclear antigen)', '0 (oncogene protein E2, Human papillomavirus type 8)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Dogs', 'Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/metabolism', 'Protein Engineering', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Virus Integration/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",PMC3677494,,2013/05/11 06:00,2013/08/07 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1221736110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1221736110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jun 4;110(23):9487-92. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1221736110.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of tyrosine kinase growth factor signaling. In the liver, this pathway confers protection against injury. However, the involvement of PTP1B in the intracellular networks activated by APAP is unknown. We have assessed PTP1B expression in APAP-induced liver failure in humans and its role in the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance between cell death and survival in human and mouse hepatocytes, as well as in a mouse model of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. PTP1B expression was increased in human liver tissue removed during liver transplant from patients for APAP overdose. PTP1B was upregulated by APAP in primary human and mouse hepatocytes together with the activation of c-jun (NH2) terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), resulting in cell death. Conversely, Akt phosphorylation and the antiapoptotic Bcl2 family members BclxL and Mcl1 were decreased. PTP1B deficiency in mouse protects hepatocytes against APAP-induced cell death, preventing glutathione depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activation of JNK and p38 MAPK. APAP-treated PTP1B(-/-) hepatocytes showed enhanced antioxidant defense through the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)beta/Src kinase family (SKF) axis, delaying tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and its nuclear exclusion, ubiquitination and degradation. Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor-mediated signaling decreased in APAP-treated wild-type hepatocytes, but was maintained in PTP1B(-/-) cells or in wild-type hepatocytes with reduced PTP1B levels by RNA interference. Likewise, both signaling cascades were modulated in mice, resulting in less severe APAP hepatotoxicity in PTP1B(-/-) mice. Our results demonstrated that PTP1B is a central player of the mechanisms triggered by APAP in hepatotoxicity, suggesting a novel therapeutic target against APAP-induced liver failure.","['Mobasher, M A', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, A', 'Santamaria, B', 'Ramos, S', 'Martin, M A', 'Goya, L', 'Rada, P', 'Letzig, L', 'James, L P', 'Cuadrado, A', 'Martin-Perez, J', 'Simpson, K J', 'Muntane, J', 'Valverde, A M']","['Mobasher MA', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez A', 'Santamaria B', 'Ramos S', 'Martin MA', 'Goya L', 'Rada P', 'Letzig L', 'James LP', 'Cuadrado A', 'Martin-Perez J', 'Simpson KJ', 'Muntane J', 'Valverde AM']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (CSIC-UAM), Madrid 28029, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/metabolism/pathology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC3674359,,2013/05/11 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013150 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.150 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 May 9;4:e626. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATL is classified into 4 distinct clinical diseases: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering. Acute ATL is the most aggressive form, representing 60% of cases and has a 4-year survival of < 5%. A frequent complication and cause of death in acute ATL patients is the presence of lytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia. We analyzed the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway because of its common role in cancer and bone remodeling. Our study demonstrated that ATL cells do not express high levels of beta-catenin but displayed high levels of LEF-1/TCF genes along with elevated levels of beta-catenin (LEF-1/TCF target genes) responsive genes. By profiling Wnt gene expression, we discovered that ATL patient leukemia cells shifted expression toward the noncanonical Wnt pathway. Interestingly, ATL cells overexpressed the osteolytic-associated genes-Wnt5a, PTHLH, and RANKL. We further show that Wnt5a secreted by ATL cells favors osteoclast differentiation and expression of RANK. Our results suggest that Wnt5a is a major contributing factor to the increase in osteolytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia found in ATL patients. Anti-Wnt5a therapy may prevent or reduce osteolytic lesions found in ATL patients and improve therapy outcome.","['Bellon, Marcia', 'Ko, Nga Ling', 'Lee, Min-Jung', 'Yao, Yuan', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Trepel, Jane B', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Bellon M', 'Ko NL', 'Lee MJ', 'Yao Y', 'Waldmann TA', 'Trepel JB', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Center for Viral Oncology, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI 058944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI058944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome', 'Wnt Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Wnt-5a Protein']",PMC3689251,,2013/05/11 06:00,2013/08/22 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57255-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-07-439109 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 20;121(25):5045-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-07-439109.

However, since not all patients can achieve remission after treatment, it is necessary to develop a novel method to overcome this problem. We investigated the anti-leukemic effect of low-dose 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) in combination with As(2)O(3) on the human AML cell lines HL-60 and K562.

In the RT-PCR and western blot analysis, the combination treatment decreased Bcl-2 expression and increased Bax and caspase-3 expression more prominently than the single treatment. In the flow cytometric analysis performed in HL-60 cells, the proportion of late apoptotic cells was 4.9% in the control, 30.0% in cells treated with 1.0 microM As(2)O(3), 8.1% in cells treated with 100 nM 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and 64.3% in cells treated with 1.0 microM As(2)O(3) plus 100 nM 1,25(OH)(2)D(3).

Cellular differentiation is an epigenetic process that requires specific and highly ordered DNA methylation and histone modification programs. Aberrant differentiation in MDS can often be traced to abnormal DNA methylation (both gains and losses of DNA methylation genome wide and at specific loci) as well as mutations in genes that regulate epigenetic programs (TET2 and DNMT3a, both involved in DNA methylation control; EZH2 and ASXL1, both involved in histone methylation control). The epigenetic nature of MDS may explain in part the serendipitous observation that it is the disease most responsive to DNA methylation inhibitors; other epigenetic-acting drugs are being explored in MDS as well. Progression in MDS is characterized by further acquisition of epigenetic defects as well as mutations in growth-controlling genes that seem to tip the proliferation/apoptosis balance and result in the development of acute myelogenous leukemia. Although MDS is clinically and physiologically heterogeneous, a case can be made that subsets of the disease can be largely explained by disordered stem cell epigenetics.","['Issa, Jean-Pierre J']",['Issa JP'],"['Fels Institute, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.jpissa@temple.edu']",['eng'],"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA158112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA121104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA158112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA046939/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['DNA Methylation/physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",PMC3650703,,2013/05/11 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58669-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-02-451757 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 9;121(19):3811-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-02-451757.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is a polymorphic enzyme causing variability in 6-MP response and toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the fluctuation in TPMT enzyme activity over time and the effect of high-dose MTX infusions on TPMT enzyme activity and 6-MP metabolites in paediatric ALL patients. METHODS: Fifty-three children with ALL treated according to the NOPHO-ALL 2000 protocol were included in the study. TPMT enzyme activity was measured at six different times starting from diagnosis until after the end of maintenance treatment. TPMT and 6-MP metabolites were measured before the initiation of high-dose MTX (HD-MTX) infusions and at 66 h post-infusion. The interaction between MTX and TPMT was investigated in vitro using recombinant TPMT protein and a leukaemic cell line. RESULTS: Forty percent of TPMT wild-type individuals had deceptively low TPMT enzyme activity according to genotype at the time of diagnosis. TPMT activity had decreased significantly 66 h after the start of HD-MTX infusions (-9.2 %; p = 0.013). MTX bound to recombinant TPMT protein severely inhibiting TPMT enzyme activity (remaining activity 16 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that TPMT genotyping should be performed in children with ALL, since 40 % of the children in our study who carried the wild-type TPMT gene were at risk of initial underdosing of 6-MP in cases where only TPMT enzyme activity was determined. MTX inhibits the TPMT enzyme activity after HD-MTX infusions due to protein binding.","['Wennerstrand, Patricia', 'Martensson, Lars-Goran', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Zimdahl, Anna', 'Appell, Malin Lindqvist']","['Wennerstrand P', 'Martensson LG', 'Soderhall S', 'Zimdahl A', 'Appell ML']","['Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology, Linkoping University, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130510,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",,,2013/05/11 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-013-1521-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2013 Sep;69(9):1641-9. doi: 10.1007/s00228-013-1521-9.

However, the clinical importance of BM fibrosis is not clear in therapy-related MDS. We retrieved all therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) cases (n = 266) diagnosed at our hospital over a 10-year period (2003-2012). Reticulin and trichrome stains were performed in cases in which BM fibrosis was suspected on initial evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide. BM fibrosis was graded according to European consensus guidelines, and a score of MF2/MF3 was defined as moderate/severe fibrosis. Moderate/severe BM fibrosis was found in 47 (17%) patients. Compared to 219 patients with no/mild BM fibrosis, the patients with moderate/severe fibrosis presented with severer thrombocytopenia (p = 0.039) and higher numbers of circulating blasts (p = 0.051) but with similar degrees of anemia and neutropenia, transfusion requirements, and similar incidences of hepatosplenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. Histological examination revealed a comparable BM cellularity and BM blast percentage, but markedly increased megakaryocytes (p < 0.001) in the fibrotic group. Although the risk distribution of cytogenetic data was similar according to the New Comprehensive Cytogenetic Scoring criteria, -5 and -17 were more frequently observed in t-MDS with moderate/severe BM fibrosis (p = 0.031 and p = 0.043, respectively). With a median follow-up of 11.5 months, patients with moderate/severe BM fibrosis showed a similar risk of acute myeloid leukemia transformation and a comparable overall survival in univariate and multivariate analyses. Moderate/severe BM fibrosis in patients with t-MDS is associated with certain clinicopathological and genetic features. However, unlike the situation in patients with primary MDS, moderate/severe BM fibrosis does not add additional risk to patients with therapy-related MDS.","['Fu, Bin', 'Ok, Chi Young', 'Goswami, Maitrayee', 'Xei, Wei', 'Jaso, Jesse M', 'Muzzafar, Tariq', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Fu B', 'Ok CY', 'Goswami M', 'Xei W', 'Jaso JM', 'Muzzafar T', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Verstovsek S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Unit 72, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20130510,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC4190057,['NIHMS630617'],2013/05/11 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1776-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Oct;92(10):1335-43. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1776-3.

In the current study, we identified Hoxa7, Hoxa9 and Hox cofactor Meis1 as AP-2alpha target genes, which are involved in myeloid leukemogenesis. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that overexpression of AP-2alpha activated transcription activities of Hoxa7, Hoxa9 and Meis1, whereas siRNA of AP-2alpha inhibited their transcription activities. We found that AP-2 binding sites in regulatory regions of three genes activated their transcription by mutant analysis and AP-2alpha could interact with AP-2 binding sites in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Further results showed that the AP-2alpha shRNA efficiently inhibited mRNA and protein levels of Hoxa7, Hoxa9 and Meis1 in AML cell lines U937 and HL60. Moreover, decreased expression of AP-2alpha resulted in a significant reduction in the growth and proliferation of AML cells in vitro.

In this study, a rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of BBM in rat plasma was developed for the first time. Caffeine was used as an internal standard. Chromatographic separation was performed on an ODS column with gradient elution using methanol-1% formic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3mL/min. Quantification was through tandem mass spectrometry with positive electrospray ionization (ESI) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) at m/z 305.2-->566.3 and 195.1-->138.0 for BBM and IS, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 1ng/mL with a linear range of 1-1000ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day assay precision (RSD) ranged from 2.0-6.4% to 2.5-5.5%, respectively, and the intra- and inter-day assay accuracy (RE) was between -5.8-6.0% and -6.5-1.4%, respectively.

Although the exact mechanism of ciclopirox is unclear, its antitumor activity has been attributed to iron chelation and inhibition of the translation initiation factor eIF5A. In this study, we identify a novel function of ciclopirox in the inhibition of mTOR. As with other mTOR inhibitors, we show that ciclopirox significantly enhances the ability of the established preclinical antileukemia compound, parthenolide, to target acute myeloid leukemia. The combination of parthenolide and ciclopirox demonstrates greater toxicity against acute myeloid leukemia than treatment with either compound alone. We also demonstrate that the ability of ciclopirox to inhibit mTOR is specific to ciclopirox because neither iron chelators nor other eIF5A inhibitors affect mTOR activity, even at high doses. We have thus identified a novel function of ciclopirox that might be important for its antileukemic activity.","['Sen, Siddhartha', 'Hassane, Duane C', 'Corbett, Cheryl', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Guzman, Monica L']","['Sen S', 'Hassane DC', 'Corbett C', 'Becker MW', 'Jordan CT', 'Guzman ML']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['DP2 OD007399/OD/NIH HHS/United States', '1 DP2 OD007399-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA158728-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130506,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '19W019ZDRJ (Ciclopirox)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ciclopirox', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Pyridones/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/agonists/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3809917,['NIHMS477274'],2013/05/11 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00204-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Sep;41(9):799-807.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.04.012.

However, little is known about factors that may restrain progenitor maturation to maintain their reservoirs. Conditional knockout mice for the Pbx1 proto-oncogene have a significant reduction in lineage-restricted progenitors in addition to a profound defect in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Through analysis of purified progenitor proliferation, differentiation capacity and transcriptional profiling, we demonstrate that Pbx1 regulates the lineage-specific output of multipotent and oligopotent progenitors. In the absence of Pbx1 multipotent progenitor (MPP) and common myeloid progenitor (CMP) pools are reduced due to aberrantly rapid myeloid maturation. This is associated with premature expression of myeloid differentiation genes and decreased maintenance of proto-oncogene transcriptional pathways, including reduced expression of Meis1, a Pbx1 dimerization partner, and its subordinate transcriptional program. Conversely, Pbx1 maintains the lymphoid differentiation potential of lymphoid-primed MPPs (LMPPs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), whose reduction in the absence of Pbx1 is associated with a defect in lymphoid priming that is also present in CMPs, which persistently express lymphoid and HSC genes underlying a previously unappreciated lineage promiscuity that is maintained by Pbx1. These results demonstrate a role for Pbx1 in restraining myeloid maturation while maintaining lymphoid potential to appropriately regulate progenitor reservoirs.","['Ficara, Francesca', 'Crisafulli, Laura', 'Lin, Chenwei', 'Iwasaki, Masayuki', 'Smith, Kevin S', 'Zammataro, Luca', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Ficara F', 'Crisafulli L', 'Lin C', 'Iwasaki M', 'Smith KS', 'Zammataro L', 'Cleary ML']","['Milan Unit, Istituto di Ricerca Genetica e Biomedica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA090735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130509,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",PMC3711206,,2013/05/11 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.125435 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.125435 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2013 Jul 15;126(Pt 14):3181-91. doi: 10.1242/jcs.125435.

The use of diagnostic radiology has become widespread in modern society, particularly in paediatrics where the clinical benefit needs to be balanced with the risk of leukaemia and brain cancer increasing after exposure to low doses of radiation. With improving long-term survival rates of radiotherapy patients and the ever-increasing use of diagnostic and interventional radiology procedures, concern has risen over the long-term risks and side effects from such treatments. Biomarker development in radiology and radiotherapy has progressed significantly in recent years to investigate the effects of such use and optimise treatment. Recent biomarker development has focused on improving the limitations of established techniques by the use of automation, increasing sensitivity and developing novel biomarkers capable of quicker results. The effect of low-dose exposure (0-100 mGy) used in radiology, which is increasingly linked to cancer incidences, is being investigated, as some recent research challenges the linear-no-threshold model. Radiotherapy biomarkers are focused on identifying radiosensitive patients, determining the treatment-associated risk and allowing for a tailored and more successful treatment of cancer patients. For biomarkers in any of these areas to be successfully developed, stringent criteria must be applied in techniques and analysis of data to reduce variation among reports and allow data sets to be accurately compared. Newly developed biomarkers can then be used in combination with the established techniques to better understand and quantify the individual biological response to exposures associated with radiology tests and to personalise treatment plans for patients.","['Manning, G', 'Rothkamm, K']","['Manning G', 'Rothkamm K']","['Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Chilton, UK.

Selective population expansion of melanocytes is achieved by suppressing proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in epidermal cell suspensions, using phorbol esters and cholera toxin. Here, we introduce a new procedure for isolation of epidermal cells, using proteolytic activity of kiwi fruit actinidin, and also an improved growth medium for melanocytes in the presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and forskolin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dermo-epidermal separation and epidermal sheet cell dispersion were performed using actinidin compared to conventional proteases including collagenase, thermolysin or trypsin. Thereafter, melanocyte culture was performed in two common media and one modified medium to discover optimization for these cells. RESULTS: We found that dermo-epidermal separation and epidermal sheet cell dispersion using kiwi fruit actinidin were considerably better than previously used methods, both from the aspect of less fibroblast and keratinocyte contamination, and of more viable native cells. Also, melanocytes proliferated better in phorbol ester- and cholera toxin-free proliferation medium supplemented with LIF and forskolin. CONCLUSION: Less contamination and higher numbers of viable cells were actinidin preferential for separation of epidermis and isolation of epidermal cells. Supplementation of LIF and forskolin to new medium increased proliferation potential of melanocytes in comparison to exogenous mitogens.","['Yarani, Reza', 'Mansouri, Kamran', 'Mohammadi-Motlagh, Hamid Reza', 'Bakhtiari, Mitra', 'Mostafaie, Ali']","['Yarani R', 'Mansouri K', 'Mohammadi-Motlagh HR', 'Bakhtiari M', 'Mostafaie A']","['Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130510,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.14 (actinidain)']",IM,"['Actinidia/enzymology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Melanocytes/*cytology/drug effects']",PMC6496922,,2013/05/11 06:00,2013/07/25 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cpr.12028 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2013 Jun;46(3):348-55. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12028.

We have previously reported the design and optimization of a series of B-cell lymphoma 2 homology domain 3-mimetics, called compounds 1-6. In this study, we evaluated the optimization of B-cell lymphoma 2 homology domain 3-mimetics from a thermodynamic perspective. Understanding the thermodynamic parameters of B-cell lymphoma 2 homology domain 3-mimetics plays a critical role in the development of B-cell lymphoma 2 small-molecule inhibitors. The thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of these compounds with the myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 protein were obtained using isothermal titration calorimetry. Owing to compounds 1-6 overcoming enthalpy-entropy compensation, the affinities of them improved gradually. Toward binding to the myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 protein, compound 6 was deemed optimal with an obtained Kd value of 238 nm, which is a 10(4) -fold improvement compared with 1. Analysis of the enthalpy and -TDeltaS efficiencies showed that ligand efficiencies with respect to molecular size are correlated with the enthalpic efficiencies. Notably, an enthalpy gain of 4.65 kcal/mol identified that an additional hydrogen bond is formed by 2 with myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 compared with compound 1. For the first time, hydrogen bonding between a small-molecule inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma 2 was demonstrated experimentally.","['Zhang, Zhichao', 'Zhao, Yan', 'Song, Ting', 'Liu, Yubo', 'Li, Xiangqian', 'Su, Pengchen', 'Xie, Shenghui']","['Zhang Z', 'Zhao Y', 'Song T', 'Liu Y', 'Li X', 'Su P', 'Xie S']","['State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116012, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130910,England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,,IM,"['Calorimetry', 'Humans', '*Molecular Mimicry', 'Thermodynamics']",,,2013/05/11 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cbdd.12161 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2013 Oct;82(4):394-400. doi: 10.1111/cbdd.12161.

Present study shows antiproliferative activity of DADS against human leukemic cell-lines, mainly U937. DADS induced transient G2/M phase arrest, which is evident from FACS analysis. The results revealed that a significant transcriptional induction of p21 happened in early hours of treatment, which is due to increased nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and its specific binding to p21 promoter. However, in the later hours, G2/M arrest is lost leading to apoptosis via intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway through generation of reactive oxygen species followed by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blots indicate release of cytochrome-c, activation of caspase-3, cleavage of PARP1, and finally decrease in bcl-2 levels. In addition, inactivation of NF-kappaB by its inhibitor BAY 11-7085 causes early onset of apoptosis without any transient G2/M arrest. Thus, in conclusion, DADS induces reversible G2/M arrest through NF-kappaB mediated pathway in human leukemic cell lines, like U937, K562, and Jurkat, lacking wild type p53. However, G2/M arrest is lost owing to the incapability of the damage repair system that leads to apoptosis.","['Dasgupta, Pritha', 'Bandyopadhyay, Sumita Sengupta']","['Dasgupta P', 'Bandyopadhyay SS']","['Department of Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAY 11-7085)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sulfones)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)']",IM,"['Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Garlic/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nitriles', 'Sulfones']",,,2013/05/11 06:00,2013/12/29 06:00,['2013/05/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2013.776090 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2013;65(4):611-22. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2013.776090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: this study sought to determine whether the experience of the establishment of a clinic for pulmonary arterial hypertension, initially created only for the treatment and diagnosis of heart failure, may be considered positive. METHODS: From 1 July 2008 to January 1, 2012 we evaluated 80 patients in our ambulatory dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of PAH. All patients were performed to clinical evaluation, ECG, and echocardiography with estimation of the sPAP. Then we evaluated the functional capacity through cardiopulmonary exercise testing or six minute walking test (6MWT). RHC was required to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. RESULTS: 80 patients (mean age: 50.9 +/- 18.68 years, 31 males) were evaluated in our center; the largest groups subjected to screening were thalassemia (21 subjects), rheumatologic patients (18 patients), respirators, suspected of ""out-of Proportion"" (12 patients) and 4 patients with OSAS. 8 adult congenital heart patients. A diagnosis of PAH after right heart catheterization was possible in 25 cases. In particular, among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, 8 had a rheumatic etiology (systemic sclerosis), 2 post-thromboembolic disease, 5 patients had congenital heart disease, 1 patient with HIV infection, 1 patient with thalassemia major, 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 1 with myelodysplasia.

In contrast to the rapid development of appropriate pre-processing and alignment software, methods for analyzing the resulting methylation profiles are relatively limited so far. For instance, an appropriate pipeline to detect DNA methylation differences between cancer and control samples is still required. RESULTS: We propose an algorithm that detects significantly differentially methylated regions in data obtained by targeted bisulfite sequencing approaches, such as reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In a first step, this approach tests all target regions for methylation differences by taking spatial dependence into account. A false discovery rate procedure controls the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected regions. In a second step, the significant target regions are trimmed to the actually differentially methylated regions. This hierarchical procedure detects differentially methylated regions with increased power compared with existing methods. AVAILABILITY: R/Bioconductor package BiSeq.

In healthy cells these two key tumor suppressors exist in a positive regulatory loop, promoting cell death and cellular senescence. However, the influence of their interplay on tumorigenesis has not been explored directly in vivo. The contribution of PML to mutant p53 driven cancer was evaluated in a mouse model harboring a p53 mutation (p53 (wild-type/R172H) ) that recapitulates a frequent p53 mutation (p53 (R175H) ) in human sporadic and Li-Fraumeni cancers. These mice with PML displayed perturbation of the hematopoietic compartment, manifested either as lymphoma or extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). EMH was associated with peripheral blood leucocytosis and macrocytic anemia, suggestive of myeloproliferative- myelodysplastic overlap. In contrast, a complete loss of PML from these mice resulted in a marked alteration in tumor profile. While the incidence of lymphomas was unaltered, EMH was not detected and the majority of mice succumbed to sarcomas. Further, males lacking PML exhibited a high incidence of soft tissue sarcomas and reduced survival, while females largely developed osteosarcomas, without impact on survival. Together, these findings demonstrate that PML is an important tumor suppressor dictating disease development in a pertinent mouse model of human cancer. KEY POINTS: (1) A mutant p53 allele disrupts hematopoiesis in mice, by promoting lymphomas and myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic overlap. (2) Coincidental p53 allele mutation and PML loss shifts the tumor profile toward sarcoma formation, which is paralleled in human leiomyosarcomas (indicated by immunohistochemistry; IHC).","['Haupt, Sue', 'Mitchell, Catherine', 'Corneille, Vincent', 'Shortt, Jake', 'Fox, Stephen', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Castillo-Martin, Mireia', 'Bonal, Dennis M', 'Cordon-Cardo, Carlos', 'Lozano, Guillermina', 'Haupt, Ygal']","['Haupt S', 'Mitchell C', 'Corneille V', 'Shortt J', 'Fox S', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Castillo-Martin M', 'Bonal DM', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Lozano G', 'Haupt Y']","['Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, VIC Australia. sue.haupt@petermac.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130508,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/etiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/etiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sex Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3713131,,2013/05/10 06:00,2014/01/18 06:00,['2013/05/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['24805 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.24805 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Jun 1;12(11):1722-31. doi: 10.4161/cc.24805.

Functionally, they play a common role as association partners of the B'gamma subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and regulate PP2A function, and their expression is increased following DNA damage. However, whether or not CycG1 and CycG2 have distinct roles during the cellular DNA damage response has remained unclear. Here, we report that CycG2, but not CycG1, co-localized with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and gammaH2AX, forming foci following ionizing radiation (IR), suggesting that CycG2 is recruited to sites of DNA repair and that CycG1 and CycG2 have distinct functions. PML failed to localize to nuclear foci when CycG2 was depleted, and vice versa. This suggests that PML and CycG2 mutually influence each other's functions following IR. Furthermore, we generated CycG2-knockout (Ccng2 (-/-) ) mice to investigate the functions of CycG2. These mice were born healthy and developed normally. However, CycG2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed an abnormal response to IR. Dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX and checkpoint kinase 2 following IR was delayed in Ccng2 (-/-) cells, suggesting that DNA damage repair may be perturbed in the absence of CycG2. Although knockdown of B'gamma in wild-type cells also delayed dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX, knockdown of B'gamma in Ccng2 (-/-) cells prolonged this delay, suggesting that CycG2 cooperates with B'gamma to dephosphorylate gammaH2AX. Taken together, we conclude that CycG2 is localized at DNA repair foci following DNA damage, and that CycG2 regulates the dephosphorylation of several factors necessary for DNA repair.","['Naito, Yoko', 'Yabuta, Norikazu', 'Sato, Jun', 'Ohno, Shouichi', 'Sakata, Muneki', 'Kasama, Takashi', 'Ikawa, Masahito', 'Nojima, Hiroshi']","['Naito Y', 'Yabuta N', 'Sato J', 'Ohno S', 'Sakata M', 'Kasama T', 'Ikawa M', 'Nojima H']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130508,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Ccng1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin G1)', '0 (Cyclin G2)', '0 (H2AX protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Ppp2r5c protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Cyclin G1/metabolism', 'Cyclin G2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/radiation effects', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3713135,,2013/05/10 06:00,2014/01/18 06:00,['2013/05/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['24878 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.24878 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Jun 1;12(11):1773-84. doi: 10.4161/cc.24878.
